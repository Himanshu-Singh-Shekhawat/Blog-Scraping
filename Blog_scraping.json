        "content": "Samreedhi Gupta\n4 days ago\n5 min read\nRegulating Third-Party Funding: A Welcome Decision by Delhi High Court\n[Samreedhi is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nInternational commercial arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism has increased in recent years. In its pursuit to develop a pro-institutional arbitration framework and become an arbitration hub, India is advancing specific economy-stimulating instruments and tactics for an efficient arbitration system. In a recent decision of the Delhi High Court in Tomorrow Sales Agency Private Limited v. SBS Holdings, INC. and Others, the Division Bench opined that non-signatory third-party funding (TPF) the arbitral proceedings cannot be liable for the adverse cost amounts merely because it funded one of the parties involved in the dispute in the arbitration proceedings. Doing so endorsed that TPF ensured fair and equal access to justice. \n\nIn this post, the author first discusses the findings of the court in Tomorrow’s case and thereafter provides an overview of the current position of law related to third party funding. In the final section, the author argues in favour of formulating a legislative guide on litigation financing and TPF in India. \n\nTomorrow's Case: An Overview \n\nIn the present case, Tomorrow Sales Agency Private Limited (TSA) entered into a “Bespoke Funding Agreement” to provide financial assistance to Transpole Logistics Private Limited (Transpole) for their claims against SBS Holdings (SBS). However, the arbitral tribunal awarded damages worth INR 250 crores in favour of SBS, which Transpole failed to pay. Subsequently, SBS filed for interim relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Arbitration Act) to recover the award costs from TSA, claiming that TSA funded the arbitral proceedings with a profit-making motive and that it is a \"real party\" to the proceedings.  \n\nAccepting the arguments put forth by SBS, the single judge bench at the Delhi High Court held that TSA had a vested interest in the outcome of the arbitration and was liable to bear the costs of the claimants in light of their agreement. Aggrieved by the decision, TSA appealed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before the Division Bench. The court gave a tripartite reasoned decision and held that the recovery petition by SBS is not maintainable. It refused to recognize a direct action against a funder as they are not a “real party” to the arbitral proceedings or award. It also opined that TSA was not obligated to pay costs as the award was enforceable against Transpole. Finally, the bench propounded that the funding agreement must include a clause that makes the funder liable for all adverse costs.\n\nGrowth of TPF: An Indian Perspective \n\nWhile the Arbitration Act remains silent on the issue of TPF, the Indian courts have acknowledged its significance and the economic benefits offered to parties with insufficient funds to allocate toward legal expenses. The Apex Court noted that there is no prohibition for any third party to fund a litigation process unless they are advocates or have any vested interest in the matter. In the absence of an express legislative provision encouraging TPF in arbitral processes, it was held that each agreement must be examined independently to ensure that they are not in contravention of the public policy standards. Similarly, the Calcutta High Court observed that TPF does not violate public policy considerations. However, such financial agreements are subject to scrutiny. They may be declared void if they provide disproportionate returns to the funder, making them unconscionable, inequitable, extortionate, unrighteous, injurious, and contrary to public policy.\n\nMoreover, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh have included state amendments to allow third-party financiers to a litigation proceeding. Additionally, the 2017 Report published by the High-Level Committee to review the institutionalization of arbitration mechanisms in India recommended the inclusion of lucid legislation outlining the principles related to TPF in India, akin to the policies adopted in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Paris. The legislative structure shall bring clarity and recognition to the TPF and pave the way for foreign investments in the country as an attractive hub for international commercial arbitration. \n\nThird-party Funding Legislative Guide: Need of the Hour \n\nThe Supreme Court has categorically elucidated that the rigid English principles of champerty and maintenance are not applicable in India and that TPF transactions are not against public policy per se. The Indian courts have repeatedly expressed the need for a code of conduct or legislative guide on TPF. The lack of regulations governing such funding exposes the funder to additional risk, and the ambiguity associated with the Arbitration Act, deters them from engaging in such contracts. Additionally, the exponential increase in the popularity of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism has prompted a surge in the overall costs, thereby compelling claimants with legitimated claims to resort to external financing. Hence, the author proposes a skeletal legislative framework to regulate litigation financing in the Indian market that could potentially prevent its abuse by unscrupulous third-party funders.\n\nThe author recommends that the TPF legislative guide be modelled on the lines of those followed in Hong Kong, the UK, and other jurisdictions where the scheme is permitted. The key considerations are as follows:\n\nDisclosure\n\nAkin to the Hong Kong Code, which mandates the funded party to disclose the identity of the funder at the time of commencement of the arbitration to ensure transparency of arbitral proceedings, the Indian laws must implement mandatory disclosure of the TPF agreement. Such disclosures are relevant to allow the opposing party to contest the financing arrangement and preclude its enforcement on reasonable grounds. \n\nConfidentiality of privileged information\n\nAlthough arbitration is founded upon the cornerstones of confidentiality, it shall be waived to allow information related to the dispute to be communicated to the third-party funder, and, in turn, the funder shall not be permitted to breach the confidentiality of the parties. \n\nSecurity of costs\n\nThe legislation shall provide guidelines that outline the liability of the funder for adverse costs. In accordance with the underlying ratio of the present case, the funding agreement must comprise a clause that extends the liability of adverse costs to the funder. The absence of such a clause would imply that the duty to pay cannot be transferred to the funder. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act enforces the award only against the parties to the dispute and not third-party funders. \n\nProfit sharing \n\nThe funding agreement shall elucidate the quantum of interest of the funder. In other words, if the arbitral award is favourable to the funding party, the guide shall clarify the proportion of the amount given to the investors that would be deemed excessive, extortionate, and unconscionable. \n\nControl\n\nThe landmark judgement by the UK High Court has remarked that the arbitrator can grant third-party funding costs only if they are reasonable and required to pursue the arbitral proceedings. The funding agreement shall state the role of the funder in the agreement as a dormant third party such that they shall not influence or control the funding party or their legal representative or the arbitration proceedings, save in cases permitted by law or the arbitral tribunal. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe Delhi High Court’s stance on TPF is a welcome decision in light of India’s pro-arbitration policy. While most common law jurisdictions worldwide have invoked the principles of champerty and maintenance as an embargo on TPF, the Indian courts had the foresight to allow it on account of fairness, justice, and equity and offer a level-playing field for enforcing legitimate rights and claims. It has ensured access to justice by allowing parties with meritorious claims but inadequate financial resources to overcome the difficulties of exorbitant costs involved in arbitration proceedings, thereby safeguarding the rights of the funder by not holding them liable for disproportionate consequences unless they were specifically included in the financing agreement. However, although TPF is not explicitly forbidden in India, the skepticism surrounding it and the dearth of ancillary factors does not make it feasible under the current arbitration regime. Thus, a legislative guide that expressly states the provisions governing TPF would not only regulate the TPF market but also resolve the conundrum surrounding TPF laws in India, thereby promoting an influx of foreign trade and establishing India as a global centre for arbitration.\nThird Party FundingFundingArbitration and ConciliationTomorrow Sales Agency\nDispute Resolution\n67 views\n1 like.

        "content": "Priyansh Sharma, Rujhan Khandelwal\nSep 26\n6 min read\nCryptocurrency to Cryptography: Analyzing the DPDP Act vis-à-vis Blockchain Startups\n[Priyansh and Rujhan are students at Institute of Law, Nirma University.]\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (Act) was passed by Parliament recently. A plethora of analytical articles have been written till now to draw out the similarities between the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2023 (Bill) since it was tabled in Parliament, and some of them also suggested few amendments to be incorporated in the Bill before transforming it into a legislation. It is pertinent to note that the novel Act is highly inspired from the GDPR, and the rationale behind this is conspicuous, i.e., the latter is one of the most stringent laws regarding data protection and privacy. \n\nThe drastic developments witnessed in blockchain technology make the general public apprised of the interplay of one's privacy and blockchain profits. The startup culture has transgressed into this arena too, and one such booming startup idea is developing software for facilitating cryptocurrency taxation. Cryptocurrency exchange platforms like WazirX, Binance, etc., have a dilemma in common that the transaction history of a user's wallet is difficult to comprehend. These startups possessing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) portals aid their users in organizing their transaction history to ascertain their profit/loss on each transaction. Such financial analysis can help users file income tax returns on their income from cryptocurrency trading.\n\nHowever, the requisite of some personal information by these startups from its users is inevitable at the account creation stage. It is also pertinent to note that these startups must inter alia possess the transaction history of their customers, which compels one to contemplate the privacy concerns regarding the misuse of personal data. The GDPR, upon which the Act is based, has certain safeguards against alleged 'data selling' and similar clandestine activities, nevertheless, there are some pressing concerns which are not addressed in the Act per se.\n\nExploiting the Law: The Inevitable Loopholes\n\nThere are certain aspects of a legislation that requires great scrutiny to ascertain whether the said legislation will be efficacious or not. If a bill is not deliberated extensively, it can have far-reaching adverse implications once it becomes a legislation. We have figured out some fundamental flaws in the conceptual methodology adopted in privacy frameworks spanning across different countries. The protagonist here is the Act, but it will not be justifiable if the article does not analyze the most appraised privacy law, i.e., the GDPR.\n\nProcessing: Is the purpose righteous?\n\nThe definition of 'processing' used in the Act is heavily borrowed from the GDPR. An entity processes 'personal data' if it performs operations like storage, retrieval, collection, structuring, etc., on the personal data. Companies with portals that require their users' personal data to create an account are necessary for providing their services. The Crypto-Taxation software collects personal data at the time of the 'Signing Up' page. Once users connect their e-wallet to the portal after the sign-up, the overlooked shenanigans emerge. The Act stipulates that entities that receive online data of Indian residents will be subjected to it. However, a blockchain startup has to comply with all the existing privacy laws because citizens of any country can sign up for its services.\n Turning to the precautions, a safeguard against retention of personal data is incorporated in the Act under Section 7(a), which mandates the data fiduciary (entity ascertaining the purpose of processing) to delete personal data once the purpose for which it is collected is fulfilled. It can be argued that the once a user provides its personal information (personal details and e-wallet transactions) to the portal, the algorithm starts delivering the output on the dashboard of the portal. The processing of data, i.e., collection, recording, storing, organizing, structuring, etc., is a perpetual process because even if the user is not active on the dashboard all the time, the portal will be functional until the point of account deletion. People have this dreadful tendency to neglect the existence of their accounts on such websites, even after they become passive on them. This signifies that personal data can be stored in identifiable form till the account is permanently deleted from the website. \n\nA solid countermeasure for protecting users from this quagmire is through automatic delinking of the e-wallet of a user from the portal due to inactivity for a particular duration. This will ensure that financial data cannot be retained by companies for illicit purposes. The processing of personal data (by means of storage) will be restricted till the time of activity on the portal, thus rendering the purpose of further retention void.\n\nData anonymization: Masking the wicked intent\n\nUnder Section 7(a) of the Act, apart from the mandate to delete personal data, an alternative can be inferred in which a data fiduciary can discharge its obligations when the purpose of data processing is finished. The term 'personal data' in Section 7(a) of the Act signifies that 'pseudonymization' as a practice will be resorted to in the Indian framework. The process includes delinking personal identifiers from personal data and keeping these identifiers separate from the remaining data. \n\nIt is pertinent to note that pseudonymized data is considered personal data under the European framework, and for that reason processing pseudonymized data attracts the provisions of GDPR. The rationale behind such classification is that the process of pseudonymization is generally reversible, i.e., the data principal can be identified through pseudonymized data by reverse engineering (linking it to the missing variables of the original data set). \n\nOn the contrary, the Act suggests that pseudonymized data is not personal data because the definition of personal data under the Act indicates the removal of personal identifiers from a set of data to render it non-personal. Data companies can utilize such practices (pseudonymization) after account deletion to retain personal data in such a form that does not enable an individual to identify a data principal from a given set of data per se. People who opt for account deletion are not aware of the back-of-the-door tactics of these companies to sell their personal data to third parties even after their account is deleted from their respective websites.\n\nData transfer: Distinguishing collection from transfer\n\nSection 16 of the Act allows the central government to restrict the transfer of personal data to third countries through notification to that effect. It is to be noted that European law has express grounds on which data transfer to third countries is valid, which prompts the inclusion of several grounds on similar structures in the Act to reduce ambiguities. \n\nThe Act is so negligently drafted that the authorities did not include the meaning of data transfer in it. Data transfer to third countries is explained in the EDPB guidelines, and within its purview, the route for transfer must have controllers/processors at both ends. The importer of personal data must be present in a third country. \n\nThe Data Protection Board of India should also be empowered to bring guidelines to foster privacy and avoid potential regulatory arbitrage. In the EDPB guidelines, it was clarified that data collection is not data transfer. For instance, if an Australian company receives data from the user itself at the time of sign-up and e-wallet linking, then such flow of data across international boundaries is not data transfer but only data collection. Hence, it is outside the ambit of the data protection framework. In the said setup, people fail to comprehend that the collected data is mostly stored in third-party servers only. Amazon, Google, etc. are major providers of cloud and database services, which means if a user is signing up on a portal for calculating blockchain income, then his data is being stored on servers of Google or Amazon which act as data processors for such SaaS portals.\n\nAs discussed above, data can be retained in a pseudonymized form even after account deletion, and consequently, such retention could be done by processors after providing a monetary consideration to data fiduciaries/controllers as a quid pro quo for such agreements irrespective of the obligation of a data fiduciary to cause its data processors to delete personal data after its purpose is fulfilled as stipulated in Section 7(b) of the Act. It is to be noted that once a set of data is pseudonymized, it is no longer categorized as personal data, at least in the Act, which potentially creates an arrangement to transfer data across countries without following the requisite compliance. The said data can later be converted to its original form.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe market of cryptocurrency is going to explode in the next few years. With the upscaling of this new market segment, the thin line between respecting one's privacy and breaching it willingly or unwillingly will vanish. As influential as it is, the GDPR still has some minor drawbacks which must be taken into cognizance. It is submitted that the Indian lawmakers did not pay heed to the existing data scams across the globe while preparing a draft for the privacy legislation. However, since the Act has been passed, which is itself commendable, it gives us hope that the lawmakers will further act cautiously while treading this imperfect road.\nData ProtectionDPDPDigital Personal Data Protection ActGDPRCryptocurrency\nCorporate Law\n•\nLaw and Policy\n82 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Strengthening FPI Disclosure Norms: SEBI’s Corrective Measures After Adani Row",
        "content": "Manas Rohilla, Smruti Kulkarni\nSep 24\n6 min read\nStrengthening FPI Disclosure Norms: SEBI’s Corrective Measures After Adani Row\n[Manas and Smruti are students at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recently notified an additional steadfast disclosure mandate for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to bolster transparency and fairness in the FPI regulation framework. The circular dated 24 August 2023 comes in the offshore of the Adani-Hindenburg controversy, where the report alleged the group for failing to comply with the requirement to disclose detailed information on beneficial owners (BOs). This claim has been substantiated by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project in its findings, wherein it has accused the conglomerate of breaching the securities rules by obfuscating the true ownership of its significant shareholders behind complex offshore structures. \n\nThe SEBI circular highlights that such instances of exploitation of the FPI route to circumvent regulatory oversight have triggered the need to put a check on the investors seeking refuge in loopholes and rectify existing norms. It further establishes various compliance measures designed to mitigate potential threats to the Indian market and investors. The author in this post delves into the backdrop of FPI regulations in India, the circular’s causal association with the recent Adani stock controversy, the new requirements and their implications on major FPIs and other stakeholders, and the related disparities.\n\nBackdrop and Shifting Paradigms\n\nIn 2014, SEBI introduced the opaque structure clause (OSC) in its FPI regulation framework. As prescribed in the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations 2014 (FPI Regulations), if an FPI is discovered to have a “lack of transparency” in its structure, it would be considered ineligible for registration. This measure was put in place to prevent FPIs from organising their entities in a manner that conceals essential ownership details. However, in 2018, SEBI made a policy shift making it mandatory for all FPIs (excluding sovereign funds) to disclose information regarding their beneficial ownership, and thus the requirement to disclose the economic interests of every ultimate natural person in FPI was withdrawn. This abrupt transition from stricter norms to a more sympathetically allied approach towards FPI was unexplained and garnered criticism. The Adani-Hindenburg controversy serves a crucial case study that demonstrates the implications of SEBI’s move.\n\nThe Adani-Hindenburg Row\n\nEarlier this year, the Hindenburg Report levied serious allegations of “accounting fraud and stock manipulation using shell entities” against the Adani group. The report also alleged that some of these FPIs are just the fronts of promoter entities. Some FPIs holding shares in Adani Group companies were believed to have concentrated a portion of their equity portfolios in only Adani Group companies, which made it difficult to track the last natural person owner. In response to this, SEBI, on the direction of the Supreme Court, started investigating these allegations and found that 13 overseas FPIs were classified as public shareholders by the group. These entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions, which made it challenging to establish their economic interests as FPIs and BOs. The withdrawal of the OSC by the regulator made it harder to investigate the situation more exhaustively.\n\nIn an effort to address these issues, the Supreme Court constituted an Expert Committee, under the chairmanship of Justice AM Sapre. The committee in its report identified the core issue impeding SEBI's enquiry was the weakening of disclosure standards. The absence of a proper regulatory framework signalled an exploitation of the market system, as the same hindered the disclosure of the last identified natural person or the last substantive owner of the FPI, who often remained elusive. The predicament was termed as “chicken and egg situation” by experts, underlining the regulator’s failure to prevent the menace.\n Challenges to SEBI’s FPI Oversight\n\nThe sympathy towards FPIs for the promotion of ease of doing business, despite several warnings from other regulators like the RBI, was not a well thought move by SEBI. The removal of the OSC resulted in the dilution of disclosure norms, enabling entities to undertake intricate structures so as to obfuscate true ownership and related party transactions. These inadequate disclosure requirements hindered the detection of potential violations of BO norms and limited access to information regarding the 13 foreign entities, thereby averting timely regulatory action. The measures taken by SEBI proved to be inept in evaluating the need for stricter regulations in the FPI sphere.\n\nThe Expert Committee gave a clean chit to the Adani group, due to the deficiencies in the FPI regulations. The regulator’s inability to prove any substantial securities law violations against the conglomerate raises questions concerning the efficacy of its FPI oversight. The inadequate measures further enabled the entity to circumvent obligations, leading to a concentration of investment in a single corporate entity. Insufficient disclosures did not give a clear picture regarding alleged infractions or the overall general operations of the organisation, making it difficult to build a strong case or initiate necessary enforcement action against the Adani group, rendering the investigation at a standstill. The recent move is a response to the impediments faced by SEBI in identifying and policing such circumstances.\n\nDecoding the Recent Circular: Implications and Discrepancies\n\nThe recent circular by SEBI mandates the disclosure of granular details of all the investors that are holding any ownership, economic interest, or exercising control in the FPIs that are holding either more than 50% of their Indian equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in a single Indian corporate group or more than INR 25,000 crores of equity AUM under Indian markets. On a thorough “look through” basis, the high-risk FPIs and all their affiliated companies will be required to disclose minute details up to the level of all natural people and/or public retail funds or significant publicly traded businesses. This promises greater transparency on “high-risk” FPIs as compared to the existing framework. The comprehensive information sought by the regulator could solve the issue faced with respect to tracking the last identified natural person of the FPIs and curing the prevalent misuse of such structures, as witnessed in the Adani case. Non-compliance with the disclosure criteria could result in FPI registration becoming invalid, a deterrent consequence of which would be the winding down of their investments within 6 months.\n\nThese new rules may pose certain implications for institutional or major financial investors, necessitating a re-evaluation of their investment strategies to avoid falling under the obligated criteria. This could severely impact the market structure due to significant sell-offs in the shares of the entities in the process of complying with the rules, resulting in lower stock prices. Additionally, the heightened scrutiny and stricter regulations may deter certain investment activities and increase compliance costs, particularly in cases involving complex arrangements and structures. \n\nIt is worth noting that the circular exempts government and government-related FPIs under Regulation 5(a)(i) of the FPI Regulations. It also excludes public retail funds as defined under Regulation 22(4) of the FPI Regulations. Considerable exemptions are also granted to exchange-traded funds, newly registered FPIs within the first 90 days following the settlement of their first trade, FPIs unable to liquidate excess assets due to statutory constraints, and FPIs in the process of winding down investments after intimation to their Designated Depository Participants.\n\nThough the prescribed exemptions are incorporated to facilitate the interests of presumed low-risk entities, the threat still persists. Even if such entities are excluded for being perceived to be innocuous, they can still be misused to circumvent regulations. To avoid compliance with the new disclosure rules, an FPI can, for example, structure its investments to fall under one of the exemptions, even if it does not qualify to be one. Exempting such entities from disclosure norms may potentially lead to BOs concealing crucial information, perpetuating ambiguity and facilitating exploitation for illicit purposes. Further, the exemptions, if not supported with additional dedicated guidelines, can promote the low-risk entities to bypass regulations, posing a potential threat of regulatory arbitrage. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe Adani case has emerged as a pivotal precedent, illuminating the compelling necessity for augmented disclosure requisites and the imperative to rectify the ramifications of inadequate regulatory measures. The deficiencies that hindered the regulator's investigation in this case underscore the exigency for a relook towards both the regulatory framework and the investigation protocols. These reforms are indispensable not only for upholding regulatory compliance but also for serving as a potent deterrent against non-compliance.\n\nThe recent disclosure mandates offer a more robust and resilient framework, poised to mitigate the risks associated with severe market fluctuations. To effectively execute these stipulated standards, SEBI must contemplate the adoption of a risk-based approach. This approach would entail subjecting entities, including those that enjoy exemptions, to varying levels of due diligence contingent upon their risk profiles. Such a stratagem ensures that high-risk entities face rigorous controls, whereas low-risk entities are not inundated by onerous procedures. While the circular represents a positive stride toward fortifying FPI disclosure regulations, it is apparent that the aforementioned issues warrant a comprehensive overhaul of its implementation, necessitating appropriate modifications in the foreseeable future.\nAdaniFPIAUMSEBIBeneficial Ownership\nCorporate Law\n179 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Unmasking Market Whispers: The Market Rumours Amendment 2023",
        "content": "Esha Rathi\nSep 23\n6 min read\nUnmasking Market Whispers: The Market Rumours Amendment 2023\n[Esha is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has introduced a series of amendments to the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR Regulations), aimed at fortifying the corporate governance and disclosure framework. One notable amendment is the market rumours amendment, incorporated within Regulation 30 in conjunction with Schedule III of the LODR Regulations.\n\nCommencing from 1 October 2023, this amendment mandates India's leading 100 listed entities, as determined by their market capitalization at the end of the immediately preceding financial year, to provide explicit confirmation, denial, or clarification regarding market rumours to the relevant stock exchanges. This obligation will expand to encompass the top 250 listed entities, taking effect from 1 April 2024 (covered listed entities). \n\nSEBI's Consultation Paper and Board Note underscore the objective of this amendment, which is to prevent the propagation of erroneous market sentiments and safeguarding investors from the emergence of a misleading market perception.\n\nGuardians of the Investors\n\nBefore the LODR Amendment, Regulation 30(11) included a general provision that allowed listed entities to, on their own initiative, confirm or deny any reported event or information to the relevant stock exchange(s). However, the amendment introduces a departure from the said provision, specifically for the top 100 and 250 listed entities. Commencing from their respective prescribed timelines, these entities are now mandated to promptly confirm, deny, or clarify any reported event or information across domestic and international mainstream media, including print and electronic platforms. This requirement applies to information that is not general or rumours of an impending specific material event, circulating amongst the investing public. Compliance with this mandate is expected within 24 hours from the initial reporting of such information or event. If the covered listed entity verifies the reported information or event, it is additionally obliged to provide the current stage of such ongoing.   \n\nThe fundamental objective of the amendment is to instate a fair playing ground for all investors, guaranteeing the uniform dissemination of accurate information. This, in turn, can lead to more informed investment decisions rather than speculative or panic-induced trading driven by investors who might act on incomplete or erroneous data. \n\nThis amendment also functions as a deterrent against intentional propagation of false rumours aimed at manipulating stock prices. Clearing up market rumours allows companies to focus on their core operations and long-term value creation strategies, rather than being side-tracked or functioning superficially through inducement of positive speculation. While our current regime involves enforcement against unfair trading practices, encompassing the dissemination of false or deceptive information that could influence the public's decision to buy or sell securities, this amendment introduces ex-ante regulations related to disclosure, which will help address the issue early on and significantly alleviate the enforcement burden.\n\nUnaligned with Market Reality? \n\nEfficient markets necessitate a delicate equilibrium between well-informed investors and speculators. Speculation and rumours have the capacity to trigger short-term price fluctuations and heightened market volatility. Although an excess of volatility can have adverse consequences, a certain degree of volatility is imperative to allow traders and speculators to capitalize on fleeting market shifts. However, the pronounced focus of the amendment on timely clarification could undermine the feasibility of short-term trading strategies, thereby deterring speculative traders from engaging in the market. The exclusion of a significant segment of the market may consequently curtail liquidity and compromise the overall efficiency of the market. Furthermore, the necessity for companies to promptly address rumours could potentially result in hasty responses and information overload that may be misconstrued by investors or media outlets. Such a scenario has the potential to deepen confusion and give rise to unintended consequences within the market. \n\nBeyond the investor and market concerns, the company is also likely to face several challenges, as has also been discussed in the SEBI Board Note. While the amendment aims to prevent market manipulation, it could inadvertently provide an opportunity for competitors and media agencies to misuse the amendment by deliberately publishing inaccurate or speculative news reports with the objective of forcing the covered listed entity to make a statement confirming or denying the reported event. Moreover, requiring companies to publicly address possibly premature matters could cause competitive disadvantage during sensitive negotiations or strategic discussions. \n\nFurther, one of the key criteria for rumours necessitating addressal is their circulation within ‘mainstream media’, which encompasses newspapers registered with the Registrar of Newspapers for India, news channels approved by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and content from news publishers as defined by the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021. This obligation also extends to the news content of foreign jurisdictions, whether or not an entity has operational presence in such jurisdiction. With the unfathomable number of newspapers and news channels that fall under this criteria, companies may find themselves compelled to allocate substantial time and resources towards dispelling and elucidating such rumours, which could potentially detract from their core business activities. \n\nLastly, if a covered listed entity denies a market rumour and then announces the transaction shortly afterward, such action might be interpreted by SEBI as a fraudulent and unfair trade practice under the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (FUTP) relating to Securities Market) Regulations 2003 (FUTP Regulations). Regulation 4(2)(f) of the FUTP Regulations deems dealing in securities as manipulative, fraudulent, or unfair if it involves knowingly disseminating false information about securities, such as financial results, financial statements, mergers and acquisitions, and regulatory approvals, prior to or during securities trading. Although the SEBI Board Note acknowledges concerns about FUTP implications resulting from this amendment, no specific defence or carve-outs have been outlined to address the potential FUTP aspect, which must be introduced at the earliest. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Put Up or Shut Up Rule (PUSU Rule) within Rule 2.6 of the Takeover Code is invoked when a leak announcement occurs. This rule mandates that a bidder must either declare a fully financed binding offer within 28 days or publicly state that they will not be pursuing an offer, in which case the bidder would be subject to a 6-month standstill. Unlike the PUSU Rule, the LODR Amendments do not impose a standstill period if the covered listed entity denies a market rumour related to a deal, leaving considerable room for ambiguity concerning the timeframe for assessing their dealings in light of the said denial. \n\nArming Up for the Future \n\nCompliance with this new requirement will require a paradigm shift in approach as well as in mindset. It would be essential for the covered listed entities to promptly initiate steps for ensuring that their infrastructure is set in order well-in advance. \n\nAcknowledging that the potential for leaks can never be completely eliminated, it is now more crucial than ever to establish strong provisions within non-disclosure agreements (NDA) to safeguard the confidentiality of deal details within a carefully selected group within the company, as has also been emphasized upon in the SEBI Board Note. While the stipulations within the NDA may not serve as a defence when a company neither confirms nor denies an existing market rumour, an NDA can effectively mitigate the likelihood of such rumours originating in the future, thus shielding the company from the need to confirm, deny, or clarify information they are not ready to release into the market.\n\nFinally, effectively monitoring daily content pertaining to the entity necessitates a robust technology-driven infrastructure and comprehensive training for employees, or alternatively, outsourcing to specialized agencies for the daily aggregation of circulating news and the prompt flagging of any market rumours.\n\nConcluding Thoughts \n\nSpeculation often carries negative connotations, and there is a prevailing preference for a sense of purity in intent, purpose, and action. The belief is that prices should be primarily driven by fundamentals, and those engaging in stock transactions should be well-informed investors who have meticulously studied the companies they invest in. \n\nHowever, the risk to economic activity from unknown future prices is largely mitigated by speculative activity, whereby prices undergo consistent fluctuations. Small yet pivotal pieces of information that might have eluded the attention of larger institutional investors are seized upon by speculators, thereby influencing market prices. This proactive role played by speculators ensures that buying and selling can occur readily, swiftly, and cost-effectively, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.\n\nIn a scenario where buyers exclusively comprise such informed investors, the market would become prohibitively expensive and restrictive. The processes of becoming a buyer would demand excessive time, resources, capital, and effort, leading to a scarcity of market participants. The dynamics between buyers and sellers would become mismatched, hampering the liquidity needed for smooth market operations. \n\nRegulation in this regard has a dual perspective, which recognizes the benefits of speculation but within a controlled environment. Without wanting to hamper the exercise of individual speculation as basis of trading, the market rumours amendment appears to attempt to offer protection to these very speculative shareholders who may lack extensive knowledge of a company’s financial performance and thus might easily fall into traps set by intentional and publicly circulated rumours. \n\nThe months to come will reveal whether this amendment, which has yet to take effect, creates a well-structured and sustainable market framework with well-informed investments or if it in fact leads to the loss of a significant segment of investors who can no longer exercise their ability to take potentially high-return risks based on their speculations.\nSEBILODRListingDisclosure RequirementsMarket RumoursConsultation Paper\nCorporate Law\n124 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "SEBI's Amendments to the AIF Regulations 2012: Backstopping the Bond Market",
        "content": "Goutham Rajeev, Vedant Bhardwaj Singh\nSep 22\n6 min read\nSEBI's Amendments to the AIF Regulations 2012: Backstopping the Bond Market\n[Goutham and Vedant are students at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the Alternative Investment Fund Regulations 2012 (Regulations) via a notification dated 15 June 2023 bringing about the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations 2023 (Amendment). The Amendment has introduced a new type of an Alternative Investment Fund in Chapter III-C to the Regulations, namely the corporate debt market development fund (Fund). \n\nThe objectives of including the Fund in the Regulations have been laid down in the SEBI Board meeting dated 29 March 2023. SEBI has created the Fund with the objective of establishing a backstop facility, which is a financial arrangement that provides additional funds if the primary source fails to meet essential demands, serving as a final support option. The backstop facility is specifically designed to buy investment-grade securities when the market is experiencing financial difficulties. It has been brought in to enhance trust among participants in the corporate bond market and enhance liquidity in the secondary market as a whole. \n\nThe Fund shall be established as a trust, and shall be close-ended with a tenure of up to 15 years. Units of the Fund shall be offered to asset management companies and specified debt-oriented schemes of the mutual funds. During periods of market dislocations, the Fund shall in proportion to the contribution made in it at a mutual fund level, buy corporate debt securities from schemes of mutual funds that are listed and have an investment grade rating, the residual maturity is not more than 5 years from the date of purchase and have no material possibility of default or adverse credit news or views. Such securities are to be held by the Fund till maturity or they can be sold in the secondary market upon reversal of the market dislocation.\n The Fund has been empowered by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Limited (NCGTC)  with a leverage to borrow funds up to ten times the size of its corpus provided that the guarantee shall not exceed INR 30,000 crores. \n In ordinary circumstances, the Fund shall invest in liquid and low-risk debt instruments. Such instruments shall not be bought at distress prices but at fair prices that may be adjusted for liquidity, interest-rate, and credit risk provided that the investment by the Fund in any investee company shall not exceed five percent of its fund capital at the time of investment. Furthermore, the Fund may also be permitted to undertake various activities related to the corporate debt market including repo, securities lending and borrowing mechanism , etc., as may be permitted by SEBI Board from time to time, subject to suitable risk management measures.\n\nWith the premise of SEBI's establishment of a backstop facility and its intended benefits set forth, it is imperative to contend that the proposed changes, in and of themselves, may fall short in adequately addressing the underlying issues at hand.\n\nCan the Fund Handle Redemption Pressure?\n\nThe corporate bond market in India is still in its developmental phase. There is a lack of confidence among Indian investors regarding corporate bonds. In market dislocation events, such lack of confidence gives rise to unprecedented risk aversion. This puts significant redemption pressure on the open-ended mutual schemes that usually buy these corporate bonds.\n Even though the Amendment has worked towards the objectives laid down in the Board meeting, it is evident that the backstop facility is, but a limited contingency plan in times of emergency in a market that is growing and is larger than the backstop facility guarantees.\n\nBased on the Indian experience regarding debt markets, the redemption pressure during market dislocation is in the range of INR 80,000 crores to 1,00,000 crores. Given that the guarantee provided by NCGTC has been capped at INR 30,000 crores, it seems unclear as to how SEBI is planning to alleviate the conundrum of redemptions during market disruption. This is because it is also unrealistic to expect the government to guarantee a larger quantum in such situations without a pre-existing mechanism.\n Liquidity Concerns\n\nA healthy bond market requires liquidity, and accurate risk assessment. A mitigation of the risk usually prevalent in emerging markets such as India has been addressed by the introduction of the Amendment. As asserted above, the growth of the corporate bond market in India is heavily dependent on AAA and AA rated bonds being issued by major corporations. This has been recognised by the RBI as well. However, there have been no concrete measures so far as to ensure a better market for lower yield bonds issued in the market, despite this issue having been raised since 2011. \n\nMoreover, when faced with substantial redemption pressure due to market dislocation, mutual funds encounter difficulties in selling their investment grade bonds with lower ratings, primarily because investors are highly risk-averse in such situations. As a consequence, they are compelled to offload their high-quality assets, leading to a greater proportion of low-rated instruments in their overall portfolio. In the Backstop Facility envisioned by SEBI, the Fund will not be able to stop such undesired allocation of low-rated instruments in the portfolio as through the Amendment, they are prohibited from buying securities that have a material possibility of default or adverse credit news or views. This is because the credit views on an instrument are influenced by the economic, political, and regulatory environment. This in turn is contingent on the levels of risk aversion and the subsequent redemption pressure in the market. Thus, the Fund may be prohibited from buying low-rated instruments during market dislocations because of their adverse credit news or views.\n\n“Swap”ing for More\n\nIssuances of non-investment level bonds have not yet picked up momentum in India even today, and it is arguable that for a comprehensive development of the bond market, the issuance of small-scale non-investment grade bonds must also be factored in. The primary reason for this stunting is due to the high credit risk associated with these bonds. There is also the fact that these defaults in the corporate debt market are usually only remediable through legal means, and there is no market remedy that provides liquidity to high-risk bonds. That is why, even though the Fund has, in a restrained manner, addressed the issues associated with the bond market with respect to high grade investment bonds, SEBI must also take parallel steps to ensure investor confidence and alleviate credit risk in such lower credit rated bonds as well in order to ensure a holistic development of the Indian corporate bond market. \n A step towards this is to encourage and ensure the development of a healthy credit default swap (CDS) market. Even though the CDS was recognised as a credible form of credit derivative through the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Act 2020, there have been no measures to promote their trade in the market.\n It can be argued that making CDS mandatory as a form of insurance for high-risk bonds, and ensuring a healthy secondary market for CDS instruments for investment level bonds to alleviate default risk are steps that are recommended to be taken. The reason behind this is that an active and developed CDS market provides liquidity in the corporate bond market as well, which has also been observed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), since the CDS instrument traded in that market is interconnected with the underlying bond itself. In other countries, such as the United States with a healthy and developed bond market, it can be seen that the market for CDS instruments is also booming.\n Strengthening Credit Rating\n\nAnother major issue that the Indian corporate debt bond market suffers from is the unreliability of the credit rating agencies that operate in the grading of debt bonds. The credit rating of bonds traded in the secondary market is essential in its price discovery and liquidity. There is evidence to the fact that CDS instruments are complementary to credit rating agencies in ensuring a much more credible and accurate credit rating of bonds in India. This can help with the ailment of credit rating of bonds in India that is also a symptom of how nascent and underdeveloped the market is, so far. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the SEBI’s introduction of the Fund through the Amendment is a step in the right direction to address certain issues in the corporate bond market, it may fall short in adequately resolving the underlying challenges. The backstop facility, though valuable in times of market dislocation, has limited capacity and may not fully alleviate redemption pressure. To achieve a comprehensive development of the bond market, SEBI should consider promoting a healthy CDS market, encouraging the issuance of lower-rated bonds, and addressing concerns related to credit rating agencies. Such measures can enhance investor confidence and foster a more robust and liquid corporate bond market in India.\nSEBIAIFBondCorporate Debt Market Development Fund\nCorporate Law\n75 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Section 54EE of Income Tax Act: Addressing the Need for a Better LTCG Exemption for Startups",
        "content": "Hrishikesh Harathi\nSep 21\n6 min read\nSection 54EE of Income Tax Act: Addressing the Need for a Better LTCG Exemption for Startups\n[Hrishikesh is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nStartups majorly rely on external investments to survive and accordingly, a lucrative tax regime is essential in order to attract investments. Long-term investors that look to invest in startups aim to make the most of their initial investment and earn exponential capital gains on their investment when their stock is sold in the long run. LTCG tax is imposed on the profits that an investor makes on the liquidation of his stock that has been held over a period of time that qualifies as long-term. This tax is crucial in incentivizing investors to invest in promising startups and fund them over the long run as it determines the proportion of the profits investors could take back once the startup has taken off and possibly further invest the proceeds in other enterprises. \n\nStartups in India are underperforming due to drops in investments each financial year as a result of which promising Indian startups with viable business ideas are failing to make their mark. While there exist other important factors that govern investments into startups, the Government should aim to formulate tax policies/exemptions that incentivize investing in promising Indian startups to ensure that they have funds to function efficiently. This article aims to argue that the exemption to long term capital gains (LTCG) tax given by Section 54EE of the Income-tax Act 1961 is unsuitable for Indian startups and addresses the need to introduce a better policy similar to the American Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) to reinvigorate them. \n\nDeficiencies in Section 54EE\n\nThe LTCG tax imposed in India is 20% of the gains realised through the sale of unlisted securities. The Finance Ministry capped the maximum applicable surcharge at 15% along with a cess rate of 4%. Thus, the overall effective tax rate on long-term gains is 23.92%. While the above-mentioned tax rate is reasonable when compared to nations such as the UK, the US and Israel, the question that arises is, keeping in mind other important factors, why promising startups in these nations are attracting sufficient investments and why their Indian counterparts face a dearth of investments. The answer, as far as LTCG tax is concerned, lies in the exemption given to LTCG tax in each of the above-mentioned nations and the investor retention their startups enjoy as a consequence of the exemption. \n\nSection 54EE(1) of the Income-tax Act states that LTCG shall not be charged on the capital gains from the transfer of a long-term capital asset provided that the whole or a part of the capital gains is invested in ‘long-term specified asset’, that is, a specified government bond within six months from the date of transfer of the capital asset. Clause (a) further notes that if the cost of the long-term specified asset is not less than the capital gains arising from the transfer of the asset, the whole of such gain shall not be charged, and clause (b) states that if the cost of the long-term specified asset is less than capital gains earned, the cost of the capital gains used to acquire the former asset shall not be charged while the rest of the capital gains shall be liable to be charged. Furthermore, the maximum amount that can be invested in a long-term specified asset is fifty lakhs during a financial year and the lock-in period of these assets is five years.\n\nThe amount of capital gains exempted under Section 54EE is limited to the amount invested in specified bonds. Therefore, if an investor wants to exempt the entirety of his LTCG from taxation, pursuant to Section 54EE, it can only be done if the entire sum is invested into a Government-notified fund. Even under clause (a), if the cost of such fund is more than the capital gains arising from the transfer of the asset, an investor would have to invest the entirety of the capital gains into the asset as any remaining un-invested capital gains amount would be liable to be taxed at the normal rate. Furthermore, if the LTCG earned by an investor from the liquidation of his equity exceed fifty lakhs, which it would for most investors, then he would have to invest a whole fifty lakhs into the notified Government asset and get the rest of the gains taxed in order to make the maximum out of the Section 54EE exemption. This defeats the entire purpose of an exemption policy. Moreover, the lock-in period for investing in government bonds is five years, thus the investors, in order to get their money back, would have to wait for five more years on top of the numerous years they locked in their money in startups. Therefore, the exemption given under Section 54EE does nothing to ensure that the investor circulates his profits/capital gains in the form of investments into other startups as it does not provide room/incentives for the same, which is exactly what policies in the US, UK, and also Israel, for instance, envisage.\n\nUK’s Enterprise Investment Scheme\n\n The UK’s Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) offers generous LTCG tax reliefs to startup investors under its capital gains tax (CGT) reliefs. Long-term gains tax on the sale of equity is 20% in the UK; however, gains realised from the liquidation of shares issued under EIS are not subject to the same provided that they were held for at least three years. Furthermore, EIS also has a deferral scheme wherein if the sum of an investor’s gains is reinvested into EIS shares between one year prior and up to three years after the gain is realised, the investor can defer capital gains tax on the sale of his initial EIS shares several years after it arises thereby giving increased options to the investor to fund budding startups and flexible tax planning. This process of sale of EIS shares and subsequent reinvestment of a part of the gains can be repeated and the capital gains tax bill can be deferred, if the investor so wishes, indefinitely.  \n\nQSBS: Balancing Investor Benefits and Incentives to Invest\n\nUSA’s QSBS scheme has been extremely useful in establishing a startup culture in the country. Established under section 1202 of Internal Revenue Code, this scheme fully exempts LTCG tax on the liquidation of QSBS provided it is held for at least 5 years. However, the exemption can only be allowed if QSBS was directly issued to the investor and does not apply if the same was bought from other shareholders. Furthermore, QSBS only applies to qualified small businesses, that is, companies with aggregate gross assets no greater than $50 million before issuance. The maximum gain exclusion under QSBS is limited to $10 million or 10 times the basis of the initial investment, whichever is greater. Post the 2008 recession, this scheme incentivized investors to invest their money into small high-risk but promising enterprises leading to the growth of successful startups and the beginning of the start-up wave across the US. \n\nIn addition to these incentives, the deferral scheme known as the “1045 rollover” provides great investor flexibility. Under this scheme, an investor can defer taxes on the sale of the original QSBS before the 5-year period by investing the sale proceeds into a replacement QSBS in another startup within 6 months of the sale. The tax on the sale of the original QSBS can be avoided when the aggregate time period of holding the original and replacement QSBS are 5 or more years. Thus, the 1045 rollover ensures investor benefits go hand-in-hand with encouraging investment in the startup ecosystem.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is crucial to formulate tax exemption policies that ensure both investor benefits and incentivize investments in start-ups. Exemption under Section 54EE does not encourage investors to further invest in startups. Drafting a policy similar to QSBS will ensure both thereby leading to investor retention and increased investments in startups. Individual investors, and venture-capital funds, which can both be companies or trusts, can be brought within the ambit of the policy, and the definition of small company under Section 2(85) of the Companies Act 2013 can be adopted to set a higher threshold limit for the policy. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) can be used as the administrative body which ensures compliance with all the criteria to be fulfilled before availing of exemption under the policy. Thus, there has to be a robust system which ensures the registration of start-ups with DPIIT, looks into the compliance aspect and then gives the exemption to investors. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe exemptions given by the policy, including the rollover benefit, will ensure that investors in startups not only avail the requisite capital gains tax exemptions but also ensure that they invest more into promising Indian startups as it will provide for both investor benefits as well as increased incentives/room to further invest into the Indian startup ecosystem leading to investor retention and sufficient funds for startups to function efficiently. \nLTCGIncome-Tax ActQSBSStart-ups\nTaxation Law\n131 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Changes to Anti-Money Laundering Laws in India: A Step in the Right Direction?",
        "content": "Apurva Singhi\nSep 20\n6 min read\nChanges to Anti-Money Laundering Laws in India: A Step in the Right Direction?\n[Apurva is a student at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences.]\n\nThe Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA) is a legislation aimed at curbing corruption and ensuring prompt reporting of the same. On 4 May, 2023, the Ministry of Finance notified changes to the PMLA. These changes increased the responsibility of Chartered Accountants (CA), Company Secretaries (CS), and Cost and Works Accountants (CWA). They were brought under the PMLA for specified financial transactions undertaken on behalf of their clients, which include buying and selling of immovable properties, management of bank accounts, managing of client money, securities and other assets, organisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management of companies, and creation, operation or management of companies, limited liability partnerships or trusts, and buying and selling of business entities. This amendment comes amidst several other changes to the regime, which are said to have been influenced by the upcoming proposed assessment of India under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) later this year. This move is expected to increase the responsibility, accountability and liability of CAs, CS and CWAs. It will alter the way in which due diligence is carried out with respect to examination of the source of funds as well as the reporting of irregularities. \n\nThe Obligations and Responsibilities of Reporting Entities\n\nThe amendment designates CAs, CS, and CWAs as reporting entities by the power granted to the government under Section 2(1)(sa)(vi). \n\nAs per Section 2(1)(wa), a reporting entity inter alia includes a person carrying on a designated business or profession. The definition of 'person carrying on a designated business or profession' has been given under Section 2(1)(sa). Section 2(1)(sa)(vi) provides that the Central Government may, by notification, designate from time to time a person carrying on such other activities. Over the years, several other entities have been notified under this section, which inter alia include real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and precious stones, multi-state co-operative societies, registrars or sub-registrars, insurance brokers and certain individuals dealing in virtual digital assets, among others. On 9 May 2023, the Central Government also notified formation agents, nominee directors, etc., as reporting entities. \n\nUnder the PMLA, Section 11A requires the entities to verify the identity of its clients as well as the beneficial owner. Section 12 requires the reporting entity to maintain records of all transactions for a period of 5 years. The rules, however, prescribe a period of 10 years. Under Section 12A, the reporting entity may, at any time, be required to furnish the information maintained under Section 12 to the Director. Section 12AA prescribes enhanced due diligence. The procedure and manner of maintaining and furnishing reports may be prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India as per Section 15. \n\nIf there is a non-compliance with the responsibilities of the reporting entities, the Director may impose a fine as under Section 13 with a minimum of INR 10,000 and a maximum of INR 1,00,000. The Director may also issue a warning, give specific instructions to the entity or require them to send in reports at regular intervals on the measures being taken by it. However, as per Section 14, other than Section 13, the reporting entities or its personnel will not be subject to any criminal or civil proceedings for furnishing information under Section 12. Thus, the liability of reporting entities extends to a fine, and other criminal consequences are not attracted.\n An audit of the records of the reporting entity may be also be ordered if necessary. Under Section 50, any officer of the entity can be summoned before the Director and examined under oath. The PMLA (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005 provide detailed directions for the maintenance of records and the obligation and procedure for furnishing details to the director. The rules also provide for due diligence and KYC requirements. \n\nThus, reporting entities have an enhanced obligation of reporting and due diligence for prevention of money laundering. The maximum penalty that may be attached is INR 1,00,000. There is no provision for imprisonment. However, if the entity is found to be party to the offence or enjoying the proceeds of crime, the reporting entity would be liable under the law but not due to its role as a reporting entity. Thus, by the inclusion of CAs, CS and CWAs as reporting entities, their liabilities are restricted to those under Section 13, which are not heavily onerous. If the reporting entity, in its role as a financial intermediary, is participating in the activity of money laundering, it would be liable under the law irrespective of its designation as reporting entity. However, it is unclear whether CAs will be equally responsible if the PMLA is invoked against the client for the specified transactions, if it has not been reported to the regulators by the reporting entities due to the fraud not being noticed, even though the diligence is carried out. \n\nPrior Reporting Requirements\n\nIt has been noted that the notification may increase the compliance burden on professionals. However, the Companies Auditors Report Order 2020, issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, prescribes the format for the statutory audits of all companies, applicable from the financial year 2020-21. Among other requirements, it imposes an obligation to report on frauds, complaints by whistle blowers, details about properties owned by the company, funds raised, and other compliances. Further, SA (Standards on Accounting) 240, specified by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, provides the auditor’s responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit of financial statements. The guidelines and ethical standards applicable to CAs also outline their responsibilities towards reporting of suspicious transactions. The Companies Act 2013 also places the onus of reporting of financial frauds on CAs and CS. The guidelines and ethical standards for CS and CWAs also highlight the responsibility of reporting of frauds. \n\nThus, the current notification does not add a requirement that is extremely removed from the duties of a CA. Under the extant code of conduct, the professionals already have a duty to be cautious of suspicious transactions. Rather, the notification formalizes the duties that are already present in the code of conduct of these professional entities. \n\nReason for and Impact of the Changes\n\nThe FATF is a global agency that monitors money laundering and terrorism financing. The intergovernmental organisation creates global norms with the intention of curtailing these unlawful actions. Recommendation 22 of the FATF provides that lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants need to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements set out in Recommendations 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17 when they prepare for or carry out transactions for their client concerning certain activities. \n\nThe intent behind the notification is to increase accountability among all participants in money laundering in order to stop transactions involving illicit funds, including their conversion into legitimate money. The reason for including CAs, CS and CWAs first may also be because of the nature of transactions they are involved in for their clients and overall for the economy. There is a need to ensure that these services are not utilised for illegal purposes, as was observed in recent cases, which is also cited as one of the motivations for the current notification. \n\nA Cross-Jurisdictional Analysis \n\nFATF recommendations are being taken up in other countries as well. In Canada, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act also envisages reporting entities who help in detection of fraud. The entities included are similar to those in India. In the UK, the guide published by the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies delineates the obligations of the accountancy sector, including Consumer Due Diligence, Money Laundering Reporting and Suspicious Transaction Reporting. The obligations apply in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. In Australia as well, accountants come under the purview of the relevant money laundering legislation. The UK as well as Australia require accountants to file suspicious activity reports as reporting entities. However, in the USA, accountants and other gatekeeper entities are not included in the anti-money laundering legislation. \n\nSimilarly, for legal professionals, while some jurisdictions have reporting requirements, such as the UK and Australia, others, such as the USA, do not have the same. While most countries are FATF compliant in this regard by including accountancy professionals in money laundering legislations, the USA stands out as one of the non-compliant countries. However, it has been reported that efforts are being made to improve the anti-money laundering regime and increase FAFT compliance. Thus, the global trend seems to be towards the inclusion of accountancy professionals in anti-money laundering laws. \n\nConclusion\n\nThis article sought to explore the impact and cause of the Central Government notification designating CAs, CS and CWAs as reporting entities under the PMLA. In this regard, the article has contributed in three ways. First, it has highlighted the obligations that CAs, CS and CWAs will now be treated as reporting entities under the PMLA. It looks into whether these obligations are new to the professionals and whether they are highly onerous. It finds that these obligations have existed in some form or another under extant guidelines and code of ethics. However, the PMLA  formalizes the obligations and adds a penalty for not following the same. Second, it looks into the motivations and reasons for the notification. Third, it looks into whether such obligations exist in other jurisdictions as well and finds the answer to be positive. Thus, the article finds that the changes to the PMLA regime are compliant with FATF recommendations and changes in other jurisdictions.\nPMLAMoney LaunderingCACSCompanies ActFATF\nCorporate Law\n35 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "SEBI's Amendments to the NCS Regulations: A Move Towards Increased Transparency?",
        "content": "Ganesh Bhaskar Lata\nSep 16\n5 min read\nSEBI's Amendments to the NCS Regulations: A Move Towards Increased Transparency?\n[Ganesh is an Advocate practicing in Mumbai.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on 3 July 2023, introduced certain amendments (Amendments) to the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations 2021 (NCS Regulations). This comes at a time where India has witnessed exponential growth in the issuance of listed non-convertible securities (NCS) by companies looking to raise debt. Financial year 2022 alone observed corporate bond issuances by Indian companies touch a record high of INR 8.2 trillion (USD 100 billion) (for further reference, see here and here).\n\nAt present, the issuance of NCSs is governed and regulated by the Companies Act 2013 (Act). NCS can either be unlisted or listed on a stock exchange recognised by SEBI. Entities proposing to issue NCS that are to be listed will have to additionally comply with the NCS Regulations and other regulations applicable for a listed issuance that are issued by SEBI from time to time. The rationale behind the Amendments introduced by SEBI was to simplify the process raising further debt, safeguard the interests of the prospective investors and to also increase transparency in the market which, according to SEBI, will encourage further issuances of NCSs and also further investor participation. In light of the same, the article seeks to analyze the efficacy of the Amendments introduced by SEBI. \n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Amendments have inter alia introduced three primary modifications to the NCS Regulations - (a) the disclosure requirements by an issuer for the issuance of listed NCSs, will now be agnostic to the mode of issuance, i.e., public issuance or a private issuance; (b) filing of the general information document (GID) and the key information document (KID) instead of filing a shelf placement memorandum; and (c) insertion of the definitions of ‘key managerial personnel’ and ‘senior management.’\n\nPrior to the Amendments, the extant NCS Regulations had separate disclosures for listed NCSs that were issued by way of private placement in comparison to listed NCSs that were issued by way of a public offer. The Amendments have now consolidated the same, requiring entities proposing to issue privately placed listed NCSs, to make the same disclosures that they would have, had it been a public issuance of listed NCSs. SEBI stated that the rationale behind the consolidation was to provide a unified framework for issuers proposing to issue NCSs. Furthermore, market participants were also of the view that there was a need for investors to have detailed information in the offer documents for an issuance of private placed NCSs that would be similar to a prospectus for a public issue of NCSs. This is a welcome amendment by SEBI as it not only ensures transparency but also encourages investor participation. This is pertinent especially at a time where there has been increased foreign participation in the Indian debt market by virtue of the SEBI and the Reserve Bank of India, easing investment routes by virtue of which foreign entities can invest in the Indian debt market.\n\nSEBI has introduced the mandatory filing of a GID, which will act as a comprehensive prospectus for the issuance of NCSs. The GID shall incorporate the information and disclosures provided under Schedule I of the NCS Regulations. The GID will be submitted to the stock exchange for the preliminary issuance and will remain valid for one year from the date of filing such GID. Post the submission of the GID, issuers will only have to submit a KID for each subsequent tranche of issuance of NCSs. The KID shall inter alia contain the following particulars: (a) specifics of the NCSs for which the KID is being issued; (ii) updated financial information if the information in the GID is more than six months old; (iii) disclosure of any material changes or material developments in the information provided in the GID. \n\nWhile, the requirement of filing a GID is issuer friendly (as issuers no longer have to prepare voluminous memoranda for each issuance of NCSs), it must be duly noted that a similar construct existed prior to the introduction of the Amendments. Issuers could previously file a shelf placement memorandum for the issuance of NCS and, thereafter, file a tranche placement memorandum under the overarching shelf placement memorandum for each subsequent issuance. However, the SEBI noted that most issuers did not utilise the existing framework of filing a shelf placement memorandum but would rather file a comprehensive memorandum for each issue of NCS which, according to SEBI, increased the time, cost and effort for all stakeholders involved. Ergo, mandating the submission of a GID and thereby a KID is less time consuming and efficient for stakeholders. \n\nBe that as it may, there are certain ambiguities on the particulars to be included a KID, namely the disclosure of any 'material changes' or 'material developments' to the information provided in the GID. SEBI has been silent with respect to what constitutes 'material changes' or 'material developments', which makes the required disclosures uncertain. However, issuers can be guided by the test for materiality as provided under Regulation 30(4) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR Regulations). The LODR Regulations provide certain tests for determining the materiality of information which inter alia include (a) an event or information the omission of which is likely to result in discontinuity or alteration of event or   information already available publicly will be deemed to be material; or (b) the omission  of  an event  or  information, whose  value  or the  expected impact in terms of value, exceeds two percent of turnover of such issuer will be deemed to material. \n\nIn addition to the enhanced disclosure norms for privately placed debt securities, SEBI has also introduced definitions of ‘key managerial personnel’ (KMP) and ‘senior management’ (SMP). KMP has the same definition as provided to it in the Act, which inter alia includes the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of a company. SMP inter alia includes those officers and personnel of a company who are members of its ‘core management team', excluding the board of directors, and shall also comprise all the members of the management one level below the chief executive officer or the managing director. The enhanced disclosures for SMPs is a positive introduction by the SEBI. Under the extant NCS Regulations, there are no definitions provided for KMPs or SMPs. The introduction of the same not only provides clarity in terms of the disclosures required but also streamlines the governance framework for companies. However, the broad manner by which an SMP has been defined may lead to possible misinterpretation in terms of the officers of a company that are to be included within the scope of a SMP. Furthermore, the definition of a SMP not only impacts the NCS Regulations, but also impacts other legislations enacted by SEBI given that an SMP has not been defined in such other legislations. \n\nConclusion\n\nWith India being at the epicenter for foreign debt investment and with its bond market rapidly growing, the need for further regulation to ensure transparency and to safeguard the interests of prospective investors is pertinent. Regulation by the SEBI, while imperative, must also be holistic and exhaustive to ensure that investors as well as prospective issuers are not caught in a web of entangled laws, further hampering the progression of the Indian bond market. The enforcement of Amendments is still at a nascent stage, and there have been no listed issuances post the introduction of Amendments. However, given that there is still a certain ambiguity with respect to certain provisions in the Amendments as aforementioned, SEBI has stated that the provisions are applicable on a \"comply or explain\" basis until 31 March 2024 and mandatorily thereafter. Hence, in the interim, there will be no harsh consequences for entities that are in non-compliance with the Amendments, until more clarifications are sought from SEBI and applicable exchanges. \nSEBINon-Convertible SecuritiesCompanies ActListingDisclosure Requirements\nCorporate Law\n63 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "BRSR 2022: India’s Ideal Intersection for Business, Human Rights and Sustainability?",
        "content": "Nankee Arora\nSep 15\n7 min read\nBRSR 2022: India’s Ideal Intersection for Business, Human Rights and Sustainability?\n[Nankee Arora is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe trend of environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting has gained popularity globally, and India has followed suit by introducing the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 2022 (BRSR) through the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The ESG requirements are based on the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) which were formulated in India in line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) which account for both human rights and sustainability. By requiring corporations to look at not only how ESG parameters affect their financial growth but also how their activities impact ESG factors, frameworks such as BRSR, in theory, have the ability to drive corporations to strike a balance between economic growth and sustainable development thereby creating an intersection between human rights, business and sustainability. This article analyses the aspects of BRSR that make it a more or less ideal intersection for business, human rights and sustainability and then proceeds to make recommendations on how the identified challenges may be overcome to realise the potential of ESG reporting frameworks to influence corporate conscience in India. \n\nFoundations of BRSR and What It Deems Material\n\nThe BRSR is based on the NGBRC, which in turn is based on the SDGs. The SDGs integrate human rights and sustainability concerns[1] across 17 Goals, accounting for economic, social, and governance factors.[2] While on paper, the logical conclusion is that human rights and sustainability are accounted for in the BRSR by basing it upon SDGs but this analysis of the BRSR would be ignorant of the inherent faults in the SDGs. Some critics argue that the SDGs were developed without sufficient participation and input from civil society, particularly from marginalized and vulnerable communities. This has led to concerns that the goals may not adequately address the needs of these communities. The SDGs were made by the powerful, developed Western countries and thus do not factor the local issues and factors that lead to human rights and sustainability concerns in India and the solutions needed to overcome them. The BRSR is praised for benchmarking to international ESG frameworks such as the ‘Global Reporting Initiative’ and the ‘Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.’ The critique that is given for the SDGs can also be directed towards the reliance placed on these other international reporting standards in the creation of the BRSR. Therefore, the use of the international frameworks alone as the bedrock of the BRSR cannot be said to be an ideal intersection of business with human rights and sustainability in the Indian context. The BRSR however, consciously or unconsciously attempts to overcome this lacuna in the fundamental considerations of the BRSR by including the proprietary ESG model developed by stakeholder empowerment services (SES), India. It is a home grown model that accounts for factors of local relevance in the reporting requirements. The requirements under the SES ESG model, however are voluntary and may not have the desired effect unless \n\nWhether or not BRSR is an ideal intersection between business, human rights and sustainability can also be determined based on what the framework considers ‘material’. Materiality is a concept that is used in investing to determine what factors would influence the decision of an investor to invest in the stock of a company. The BRSR is a consultative tool that involves engaging with and incorporating feedback from external stakeholder groups. By doing so, it helps companies identify and address potential human rights and environmental risks associated with their operations. As a result, companies can take specific, proactive and direct measures to mitigate these risks and operate in a more sustainable and socially responsible manner. The potential for collaboration between the company, civil society, human rights and environmental groups allows companies to identify specific, localized issues and address them directly, either through internal policy changes or CSR. This ensures that the reformative efforts undertaken by the company in accordance with the BRSR are not general and unorganised but rather specifically directed to those directly affected by the operations of the company, both within and outside India. This vision is not implicit in the BRSR, rather it is explicitly stated in ‘object’ clause that accompanies each disclosure, showing a clear intent on the part of the creators of the framework to make human rights and sustainability goals integral to the framework. Another added layer of protection, that makes the framework ideal, is the requirement in the framework that companies must also report on the strategies they have undertaken, so an external stakeholder evaluating their BRSR can gauge the degree to which the company has considered affected stakeholder groups and included their feedback in internal policy. \n\nUpon the first view, it may seem as though the businesses will be at a major disadvantage, having to make heavy investments in fulfilling the ESG requirements. However, research shows that companies with a high ESG rating are more likely to be financially successful. It is likely that this is the result of a shifting consumer consciousness to sustainability and human rights concerns. Therefore, when a company showcases, that it is integrating these concerns into its operations and decision-making, that too through statutorily approved disclosure mechanisms, it generates a lot of goodwill and recognition from consumers in the market. Thus, reporting frameworks such as BRSR truly have the capability to meet not only human rights and sustainability goals but also the fulfil the primary goal of a business, that is, profit.  \n Enforcement, Implementation and Transparency \n\nAs identified above, the structure and formulation of the BRSR clearly reflect an attempt to find an intersection between human rights, sustainability and business. While in theory, an intersection is suggested but whether or not it is implemented in practice is contingent upon the extent to which companies have to comply with the disclosure requirements and the manner in which they have to disclose the data.\n\nThe most glaring issue is the division of the disclosure requirements into essential and voluntary. Most of the requirements fall under the ‘voluntary’ category therefore rendering the intersectional vision of the BRSR only a concept in theory. This division is made worse by its capacity to allow firms to produce inconsistent and incomplete data about their activities. For instance, whether or not human rights requirements form part of a firm’s business contracts is a mandatory requirement but whether any human rights due diligence was undertaken is voluntary, thereby producing inconsistent information on how the company identifies human rights risks and further incorporates them into its contracts. \n                                                                                                              Even the requirements that are mandatory are required to be reported in a more quantitative than qualitative manner. A lot of the requirements are framed in a ‘yes or no’ format. This even applies to questions such as ‘do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No).’ Companies are not required to elaborate on the specific aspects of their policy thereby leaving the stakeholder unable to draw comparisons between the policies or even evaluate whether the policy of an individual company is appropriate, effective, and inclusive. What is worse is that while there are some parameters that must be appraised and disclosed with specific metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions, these too are unreliable. The lack of reliability is attributed to the fact that this data is not verified by any independent statutory authority. While companies are allowed to get their data verified by an external agency, these, too, are unverified. Therefore, companies are not deterred from publishing false and / or manipulated data.\n\nThe outcome of a framework that is ideal in theory but is easily manipulated and evaded in practice, is a framework that is setting itself up for greenwashing. However, it can be speculated that this effect is exactly what the Indian government intended, that is, to globally present itself as a country that is contributing to the evolving ESG framework while ensuring that such a framework does not hamper the ease of doing business in India. Therefore, both the government and the businesses are extracting the goodwill and recognition that comes with being ESG-friendly without any intention to internalize an ESG conscience thereby fundamentally failing to be an intersection between business, human rights and sustainability. \n\nLooking Forward\n\nFrameworks such as the BRSR will only become ideal intersections when they will have the capacity to transform business conscience. In its current form external stakeholders using the BRSR to evaluate the ESG-friendliness of the company must be extremely wary of the accuracy of the information reported and treat ‘ESG ratings’ or ‘ESG scores’ given to the company by external, independent organisations on the basis of its BRSR report. An ideal situation would be that the government implements the BRSR very strictly and independently verifies the information reported, but as mentioned above, the government is not economically incentivized to fundamentally shift its attitude towards ESGs, just yet. The only way for the BRSR or any other reporting framework to have the effect of transforming business conscience is the way any and all change has been brought about in the dialogue of human rights and sustainability, and that is, pressure from the consumers and the community. These stakeholders will have to actively reveal the lapses in the BRSR and publish their findings to the public to generate pressure on businesses and the government to create more effective frameworks. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe requirements of the BRSR are framed in such a way that they have the potential to influence companies to incorporate respect for human rights and sustainability into their core business strategies. It is often said that sustainability is a market incentive, and if one wants it to be bought, one needs to sell it well, and in its current form, with its lax requirements, lack of transparency and unreliable forms of measurement, that is all the BRSR does. Only when external stakeholders such as consumers and the community unveil the defects in the BRSR and pressurize the government to independently evaluate the information in the BRSR, is there scope for the BRSR to be an ideal intersection between business, human rights and sustainability.\n[1] See SDG Goal 1 that aims to end poverty in all its forms, including ensuring access to basic needs such as food, water, and sanitation. This is critical for the realization of human rights, such as the right to an adequate standard of living. \n[2] See SDG Goal 7 that aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, which is essential for economic development, environmental sustainability, and the realization of many human rights, including the right to education, health, and a clean environment.\nBRSRSEBISustainable Development GoalsESGNational GuidelinesResponsible Business Conduct\nCorporate Law\n62 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Navigating Regulatory Jurisdiction and Due Process: Unraveling the Sanmati Agrizone Conundrum",
        "content": "Vaibhav Gupta, Vaibhav Nishad\nSep 13\n6 min read\nNavigating Regulatory Jurisdiction and Due Process: Unraveling the Sanmati Agrizone Conundrum\n[Vaibhav Gupta and Vaibhav Nishad are students at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nIn the recent Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ (MCA) crackdown on shell companies, striking down many companies in the process, has created a spurt to burnish the operation of these non-functional companies. Under this haste to clamp down on shell companies, it has also been observed that some cases like that of M/s Sanmati Agrizone Private Limited v. Registrar of Companies becomes a matter of discrete, where the Registrar of Companies (ROC) unilaterally struck off the name of the company without following the due process as provided under the law.\n\nThe author analyzes how the action of the ROC of striking down the name of the company without notice has raised concerns about the possible erosion of the fundamental due process as laid down in Section 248 of the Companies Act 2013. Further, the company law tribunals, by endorsing this regulatory action, have potentially failed to abide by the fundamental principles of natural justice.\n\nFacts of the Case\n The case involves M/s Sanmati Agrizone Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act 2013. Due to financial instability, the company missed filing financial statements with the ROC for two consecutive financial years post FY 2015-16. The management later realized this oversight and intended to rectify it. While in the process of preparing documents for filing with the ROC in July 2020, the company became aware of its name being struck off. Subsequently, the company filed an appeal before the NCLT Delhi bench under Section 252 of the Act. NCLT upheld the decision of ROC by stating that the company was not in operation or carrying out its business at the time it was struck off.  \n\nThis decision was further appealed by Sanmati Agrizone to the NCLAT under Section 421 of the Act, contending that the decision was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice, as no notice was served to the company by the ROC. It was also contended that the company was incurring the cost on employees, signifying that the company was working. This appeal was also dismissed with the Bench giving the observation that the company in its financial statements has “zero revenue” for the preceding two years and therefore, the company was neither in operation nor carrying out its business at the time of its name was struck off. However, crucially, Sanmati Agrizone's contention regarding the notice was left unaddressed.\n Due Process and the Precedents Thereof\n\nSection 248 (1)(c) of the Companies Act 2013 enables the ROC to strike off the name of a company from the register, if it has not conducted business for two consecutive financial years and has not applied for dormant company status. \n\nOn meeting the aforesaid conditions, Section 248 to be read with The Companies (Removal of Name of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules 2016, provides for the ROC to issue a formal notice (show cause notice) vide form STK 1 to both the company and its directors. This notice conveys the ROC’s intent to remove the company’s name from the Register of Companies. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the defaulting company may provide justifications as to why the strike-off should not occur and at the same time notice also provides a window for the company to take corrective measures to avert the impending removal.\n\nThe significance of notice in adjudicatory procedure was examined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Gorkha Security Services v. Government of NCT of Delhi, where the apex court emphasised that for significant and adverse executive actions such as debarring or blacklisting orders, a show cause notice to the affected party is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the Patna High Court, in Sitaram Singh Construction Private Limited v. Union of India and Another emphasised on the importance of adhering to due process. Section 560 of the Companies Act 1956 mandates the ROC to issue three notices before striking off a company, and the court held the omission of the third notice led the decision of striking off to be arbitrary and ruled in favour of the company. Furthermore, NCLT Delhi in Poly Auto System v. RoC Delhi similarly gave importance to due process, where due to lack of proper notice, the tribunal directed the ROC to restore the company’s name in the register without deciding on merits of the arguments of ROC. \n\nFrom the outlined procedure and the judicial precedents thereto, it can be said that the ROC is authorised to proceed with the strike-off of a company only when the company is unable to present substantial evidence against the action or acts to rectify the cause. However, the provision does not enable ROC to adjudicate on non-compliance ex-parte, rather provide for an opportunity of hearing as well as rectification, which signifies the nature of provision and the powers conferred to ROC as non-punitive and tilted in favour of company’s existence.\n\nTribunal Oversight: Addressing Procedural Deficiencies\n\nThis judgement in Sanmati Agrizone Private Limited seems to have expanded the scope of Section 248(1) which leads to expansion of power of the ROC to the extent where it may strike-off any company without prior notice in an arbitrary manner. In such a scenario, the defaulting company may itself not be aware of the fact that it does not remain a registered “company” anymore. \n\nFurthermore, the decision of strike-off can be equated to a “death sentence” for the company by the ROC as once the company is struck down it cannot operate anymore as per Section 250 of the Act. Therefore, to avoid such situations, the ROC is mandated to follow the due process by sending notice to the company intending to strike-off its name from the registrar and provide them with the opportunity to make their representations to the ROC. This, in turn, serves as the essential tenet of the principles of natural justice i.e., audi alteram partem, which asserts that every individual has the right to be heard and defend themselves before any action is taken against them. In the recent case of State Bank of India v. Rajesh Agarwal, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the significance of audi alteram partem in India.\n\nIn the landmark case of State of Orissa v. Dr Binapani, the Supreme Court emphasised that administrative orders with civil consequences must align with the principles of natural justice. Additionally, it highlighted the imperative nature of affording the defaulting party an opportunity of being heard prior to the execution of any action. This essential right enables party to address any shortcomings and engage with the presented evidence against them. \n\nThe principle of audi alteram partem is a non-negotiating principle, and in no case can ROC justify non-issuance of notice on any ground. This same has been held by the Supreme Court in Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation, where it was observed that an action without affording the defaulting party with an opportunity to be heard cannot be justified on the mere ground that the affected party would have no explanation even if hearing is afforded by serving notice.\n\nIn the present case, the removal of the company’s name by the ROC, without issuing any notice to the company and affording it with “an opportunity of being heard”, unequivocally violates the essence of audi alteram partem, making the order by ROC liable to be declared illegal on account of fundamental breach of the principles of natural justice. Regrettably, both the NCLT and the NCLAT have ignored the company’s contention that the order of ROC is arbitrary and in violation of the principles of natural justice. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe case of M/s Sanmati Agrizone Private Limited serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate interplay between regulatory imperatives and the sacrosanct principles of due process and natural justice within the realm of corporate governance. While the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ vigilance in addressing dormant companies is commendable, it is imperative that the spirit of the law, which upholds fairness and transparency, prevails in every instance. The substantive provisions along with the jurisprudential evolution clearly demonstrates the significance of notice and the principle of “opportunity to be heard”. \n\nThe Sanmati Agrizone case raises pertinent questions about the extent of regulatory authority, urging a judicious balance that safeguards the interests of all stakeholders involved. As the corporate legal landscape continues to evolve, it remains incumbent upon regulatory bodies and judicial authorities to navigate this terrain with unwavering commitment to both the letter and the spirit of the law, ensuring that the principles of due process and natural justice remain inviolate pillars of corporate governance in India.\nCompanies ActRoCStrike-OffSection 248MCA\nCorporate Law\n88 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Auditor Liability and ‘Emphasis of Matter’ Misuse: NFRA's Vigilance in Upholding Financial Reporting",
        "content": "Avantika\nSep 11\n4 min read\nAuditor Liability and ‘Emphasis of Matter’ Misuse: NFRA's Vigilance in Upholding Financial Reporting\n[Avantika is a student at Campus Law Centre, Faculty of Law, Delhi University.]\n\nIn a recent development, the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) has taken decisive action by issuing orders that underscore the critical importance of upholding audit standards. The orders pertain to two specific cases -- matter of Bartronics India Limited and matter of Burnpur Cement Limited -- centering on instances where statutory auditors, instead of appropriately modifying their audit opinions, misused the emphasis of matter (EOM) section within audit reports to obscure misstatements in financial statements. \n\nSignificance of Financial Reporting in Combating White-Collar Crime\n\nWhite-collar crimes often involve financial manipulation, misrepresentation, and fraud within corporate entities. Auditors play a pivotal role in detecting and preventing such offenses by examining financial records and providing independent assurance about their accuracy. NFRA plays a crucial role in the realm of white-collar crime law practice, particularly in the context of financial reporting, auditing, and corporate governance. Established in 2018 under the Companies Act 2013, NFRA was created to oversee and regulate the quality of financial reporting, auditing, and ethical conduct of professionals in India. Cases involving white-collar crimes often revolve around financial misconduct, fraud, and unethical practices within the corporate or financial sector. These crimes can encompass various offenses, such as, insider trading, money laundering, and securities fraud. Given the complex nature of these crimes, accurate financial information and adherence to auditing standards are crucial for both preventing and prosecuting such offenses.\n\nNFRA's recent orders highlight the grave consequences of auditors deviating from their ethical responsibilities and standards. The misuse of the EOM section to conceal misstatements raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and the overall reliability of financial reporting. Any deviations from standards, even seemingly minor ones like misusing the EOM section, can have severe legal implications. Auditors' actions, as evidenced by NFRA orders, can be used to establish intent, negligence, or deliberate attempts to cover up financial irregularities. These NFRA's orders could set a precedent for future cases, where auditors' conduct is under scrutiny and serve as reference points and guiding principles for similar cases, contributing to shaping the contours of misstatements in financial statements. \n\nEOM v/s Modified Opinion\n\nIn accordance with Standard on Auditing (SA) 700, an auditor is responsible for forming an opinion regarding the preparation of financial statements, ensuring they adhere to the relevant financial reporting framework and are materially accurate. After evaluating the evidence obtained during the audit process, the auditor has the discretion to express an opinion that is either unmodified (favorable) or modified (reflecting certain concerns) in the auditor's report. However, there is a scenario outlined in the standard where the auditor might include an EOM paragraph in the report. This paragraph is used to bring attention to specific matters disclosed in the financial statements that hold significant importance, as they are fundamental to users' comprehension of the financial statements. Since EOM included by the auditor for additional communication of facts acts like an opinion of the auditor, it often leads to confusion as to whether the inclusion of the EOM paragraph is a substitute for expressing a modified opinion.\n\nNFRA's Examination of EOM Misuse in Audit Reports \n\nIn the case of Bartronics India Limited, matters such as non-provision of interest on loans, doubtful capital advances, non-repayment of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCB), etc. were reported under EOM by the auditor. NFRA observed that certain matters, such as the provision of interest on unsecured loans, were not adequately disclosed in the financial statements, making their inclusion in the EOM paragraph inappropriate. Further, it was observed that the audit report highlighted uncertainties regarding the recoverability of capital advances and trade receivables. This contradicts with the requirement that an EOM paragraph should only be included if there is sufficient evidence that the matter is not materially misstated. It was further observed that issues related to the non-repayment of FCCB and uncertainties about a project's status as a going concern were matters that required separate evaluation and potential qualification of the audit opinion. Thus, the auditor included material information in EOM, instead of subjecting the same to appropriate audit procedures, thereby abdicating their responsibility.\n\nIn case of Burnpur Cement Limited (BCL), the company was burdened with substantial debt, defaulted on payments, and carried negative working capital. The company's financial condition suggested potential challenges to the application of the going concern assumption. BCL’s financial statements showed a loss of INR 44.49 crores for the year ending 31 March 2018, accumulating losses of INR 102.97 crores and a negative net worth of INR 0.416 crores. Despite these unfavourable circumstances, the auditor merely incorporated this matter within the EOM paragraph in the auditor's report, rather than thoroughly assessing whether a qualified or adverse opinion was warranted. NFRA observed that the auditor's judgment was influenced by inadequate disclosure by the company regarding its financial distress, including factors such as negative net worth, overall losses, high liabilities, non-operational divisions, and excessive reliance on one-time settlements, and the auditor’s failure to conduct a thorough evaluation led to an improper utilization of the EOM paragraph, which is meant to emphasize matters within the financial statements rather than to act a substitute for expressing a modified opinion.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the observed discrepancies in the audit reports of Bartronics India Limited and BCL, NFRA has identified critical lapses in adhering to established auditing standards. These instances underscore the need for auditors to exercise meticulousness in their application of auditing standards, ensuring that the EOM paragraph serves its intended purpose of enhancing communication while maintaining the integrity of audit opinions. The NFRA's observations highlight the potential consequences of inadequate disclosure and incomplete analysis, which can misrepresent the financial health of the audited entities. Auditors must diligently assess and report uncertainties, material misstatements, and going concern assumptions in accordance with the applicable standards, thereby upholding transparency, accountability, and trust in financial reporting. For legal professionals dealing with white-collar crimes, these developments highlight the evolving landscape of financial accountability and the critical role auditors play in unveiling potential misconduct. Understanding these nuances is essential for effectively navigating cases involving financial irregularities.\nNFRAStandard on AuditingCompanies ActWhite-Collar CrimeBartronicsBurnpur\nCorporate Law\n73 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "SEBI’s Amendment on Unliquidated Investments: Assessing the Potential Implications",
        "content": "Shalin Ghosh\nSep 11\n6 min read\nSEBI’s Amendment on Unliquidated Investments: Assessing the Potential Implications\n[Shalin is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nWitnessing an impressive compound annual growth rate of 50% in the last 5 years, alternative investment funds (AIFs) have quickly emerged as a lucrative asset class for the Indian investor. However, inherent in this buoyant growth story is liquidity risk, an aspect that has troubled many stakeholders over the years. AIFs engaged in sectors such as real estate, healthcare, and technology have long faced liquidity issues, jeopardizing investor returns as investments remained unsold due to lack of liquidity during the winding up process. \n\nOn 15 June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations 2023 (Amendment Regulations) which amended the SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund) Regulations 2012 (AIF Regulations). The amendment would now allow AIFs to launch liquidation schemes to sell illiquid investments or distribute them in-specie after receiving the required investor approval to aid the funds in maximizing asset value. \n\nThis article presents the pre-amendment context and regulatory concerns and provides a brief overview of the key changes advanced by SEBI. It subsequently discusses some positive impacts of the Amendment Regulations while also examining the potential implementational challenges and their impact on the larger AIF industry.   \n\nContext and Regulatory Intent\n\nRegulation 13(5) of the AIF Regulations states that AIFs can only increase the tenure of a scheme only up to 2 years, provided two-thirds of the investors (in terms of the value of their investment in the AIF) approve of such an extension. This restriction does not apply to Large Value Funds for Accredited Investors which can extend the scheme’s tenure beyond 2 years, subject to the relevant clauses stipulated in the fund documents. Regulation 29(8) provides that at the end of an AIF’s tenure (inclusive of any extension), it may distribute the illiquid investments in-specie after receiving the approval of 75% of the investors by value. In case such in-specie distribution fails, AIFs shall fully liquidate the scheme within one year after the expiry of their tenure.\n\nIn a consultation paper floated in February 2023, SEBI stated that it received applications from many AIFs seeking an extension of their scheme tenure due to regulatory and legal obstacles and lack of liquidity. The sample data collected by SEBI revealed that the 2-year extension period for 24 schemes worth INR 3,037 crores would end in FY 2023-24, while the extension of another 43 schemes worth INR 13,450 crores would expire in FY 2024-25. Considering these findings, the consultation paper suggested that AIFs and investors be provided with the option of carrying forward unliquidated investments beyond the 2-year period mandated by law. \n\nArguably, the policy change could also be influenced by instances such as the recent cases of 360 ONE Private Equity Fund (formerly, IIFL Private Equity Fund) shuttering its real estate AIF thereby impacting investor returns and ICICI Prudential closing its real estate AIF while 6 underlying investments remained stuck with the fund even after its expiry in March. In view of the lack of liquidity options for AIFs nearing the end of their tenure, SEBI’s intent appears to be providing greater flexibility to such AIFs to efficiently deal with unsold and illiquid residual assets.\n\nOverview of the Amendment Regulations    \n\nPut briefly, the amendments effectively provide 3 additional methods to the AIFs approaching the end of their term in handling illiquid and unsold investments. An AIF may either choose to transfer the unliquidated investments to a new liquidation scheme at the time of winding up or distribute the investments in-specie in a prescribed manner upon receiving the approval of 75% of the investors (in terms of the value of their investment in the AIF) while also arranging bids for a minimum of 25% of the unliquidated investments. A liquidation scheme can neither accept fresh commitments from investors nor make new investments. However, if the requisite investor consent is not obtained for the transfer of unliquidated assets to a liquidation scheme or for an in-specie distribution, then such unliquidated assets shall be mandatorily distributed to the investors in-specie. In case an investor refuses to an in-specie distribution, the amount will be written off. Additionally, SEBI has also stipulated that an AIF manager shall report the amount transferred to a liquidation scheme or distributed in-specie to benchmarking agencies and adequately disclose it under the private placement memorandum (PPM).    \n\nPotential Benefits\n\nThe problem of private equity being an asset class with considerable unknowns is particularly accentuated in case of unlisted and illiquid securities. This makes it difficult for a fund to liquidate such assets despite the end of its tenure, putting fund managers at the risk of regulatory default if a timely liquidation does not materialize. Transferring the unliquidated securities to a liquidation scheme could provide an alternative solution by preventing a distressed sale of assets, allowing funds to avoid a forced liquidation based on time and instead providing flexibility to sell when market conditions are favourable, benefiting investors. Requiring AIF managers to report the value regarding sale of unliquidated investments for benchmarking and disclosing it in scheme PPMs is also a positive development. Given that unliquidated investments are a significant component of AIF portfolios, their inclusion in performance benchmarking aligns with the AIF manager’s fiduciary duties towards the fund while also encouraging greater attention to exit strategies during investment.        \n\nDrawbacks and Challenges      \n    While the policy intent of the Amendment Regulations is laudable, the implementation of the above-discussed changes is beset with challenges. First, the execution of the mandatory in-specie distribution could be problematic on multiple fronts. It may create a conflicting situation for investors as to whether they should vote in favour of or against a liquidation scheme. For instance, while the investors voting in the scheme’s favour will not get the bid amount available to the dissenting investors, if there are too many investors dissenting, the 75% investor approval threshold would not be met and consequently all the investors would end up receiving in-specie distributions.\n\nA striking concern regarding mandatory in-specie distribution is that such distributions to foreign investors are not yet recognised under Indian exchange control laws, thereby necessitating RBI’s approval and increasing the compliance burden. Mandatory in-specie distribution may also be illegal if the AIF in question has invested in companies dealing in sensitive sectors, due to the limitations on foreign investors on holding those securities. This would also go against Regulation 20(5) of the AIF Regulations which casts an obligation on the fund manager to ensure that no decision of an AIF contravenes applicable laws.        \n\nSecond, the policy also suffers from a lack of clarity on certain aspects. The Amendment Regulations do not specify how dissenting investors would be treated in cases where the fund manager fails to achieve the minimum bid of 25% of the unliquidated investments. SEBI’s circular also does not clearly delineate the scope of the Amendment Regulations insofar as liquidation schemes are concerned. The policy is silent as to whether it extends to AIFs that have already exceeded their tenure and those that are in the middle of the one-year extension of their terms. Moreover, there is no clarity as to whether venture capital funds set up under the erstwhile SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations 1996 would also come under the policy’s remit.\n\nThird, the transfer of unliquidated investments from the AIF in exchange of units of the liquidation scheme could result in capital gains in the hands of the unit holders which would eventually be liable for taxation. SEBI also seems to have overlooked frequently occurring obstacles such as investigative orders, prolonged litigation, and ongoing insolvency resolution, among other factors, that may altogether prevent the transfer of unliquidated investments from an AIF to a liquidation scheme.\n\nFourth, it is a global trend that at the end of an AIF’s tenure, fund managers seek fresh commitments from new investors to facilitate the exit of dissenting investors. The incoming capital is used to buy out some or all of the shares held by the exiting investors who wish to cash out. However, the Amendment Regulations do not allow a liquidation scheme to accept fresh commitments from investors. This could create challenges for fund managers in raising capital when there are dissenting investors choosing to exit.   \n\nFifth, the amendment reflects SEBI’s continuing unwillingness to deter close ended funds from extending their tenure beyond the stipulated time in the PPM. A fund, as in the case of Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital Fund, might want to extend its tenure as the exit provided to unitholders may not be profitable due to the influence of several extraneous circumstances such as economic slowdown, high interest rates, inadequate developer funding, and high construction costs, among others. Often, an AIF’s investments remain unliquidated due to lack of buyers at acceptable prices. In-specie distribution may not always be commercially sound as investors would then receive small stakes of the investee company which would be difficult to sell. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the Amendment Regulations are introduced with the noble objective of boosting investor confidence, SEBI must assess the evident challenges and loopholes. For instance, the potential tax implications and the issues concerning the transfer of unliquidated investments could be solved if the original scheme holding such investments acts as a liquidation vehicle rather than transferring the investments to another scheme. Similar fine-tuning and clarity on aspects such as the scope of the amendments’ applicability would be a step towards augmenting the growth of AIFs in India.   \nSEBIAIFUnliquidated InvestmentsConsultation Paper\nCorporate Law\n89 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Reshaping Tax Laws: Stigma of Retrospective Tax Amendments Amidst Supreme Court's Landmark Ruling",
        "content": "Ananya Karnwal, Astha Agarwal\nSep 9\n6 min read\nReshaping Tax Laws: Stigma of Retrospective Tax Amendments Amidst Supreme Court's Landmark Ruling\n[Ananya and Astha are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe Supreme Court made a significant judgement in April 2023 regarding taxation law, stating that the amendment to Section 153C of the Income Tax Act 1961, introduced by the Finance Act 2015, will apply retrospectively to searches conducted before June 2015.\n\nSection 153C grants the revenue department 'the authority to take action against a party other than the individual being searched if any incriminating articles pertaining to the other person are discovered during the search'. Originally, the provision included the phrase 'belong/belongs to', which was replaced by 'pertain/pertains' by the 2015 amendment that offered a broader scope of interpretation to the courts in proceeding against such third parties. The present case revolved around determining the applicability of the 2015 amendment in light of its legislative intent.\n\nThis article focuses on the concept of retrospective amendments in the field of taxation laws and the development of the same in the Indian scenario. It further studies the reasoning of the apex court in the recent judgement and how it strives to strike a balance between taxpayers’ interests and the legislative intent of the 2015 amendment.\n\nHistorical Background \n\nThe Ministry of Finance presents its finance budget before the start of each financial year. This budget encompasses an evaluation of the previous year’s performance and outlines proposals and plans for the upcoming year, including revenue allocation to different sectors and changes in tax laws (both direct and indirect taxes). These changes, commonly known as ‘amendments’, are introduced with considerations for ongoing developments, taxpayer welfare, addressing previously unresolved loopholes, and taking into account feedback from stakeholders. \n\nThere are two types of amendments based on their specified application date: prospective amendments, and retrospective amendments. \n\nProspective amendments are relatively straightforward to handle and are generally accepted due to their nature of application. On the other hand, retrospective amendments introduce significant confusion and complexity and are not readily accepted. As a result, the effective date of the law’s application plays a crucial role in determining its impact on taxpayers, allowing them to prepare and plan their next steps accordingly.\n\nA retrospective tax is a levy imposed on transactions that occurred in the distant past. Thus, it can entail a new or additional charge on past transactions. In 2012, the Indian government introduced a retrospective tax amendment in the Finance Bill. The purpose of retrospective tax is to make adjustments when there is a significant disparity between past and present policies, resulting in potentially lower taxes paid under the previous policy. By applying taxes under the current policy, retrospective tax seeks to rectify such situations. Many countries employ this form of taxation to address deviations in past tax policies that allowed companies to exploit loopholes for their benefit. Retrospective tax affects companies that may have unknowingly or knowingly taken advantage of different tax rules. Not only India but several other countries, including the US, the UK, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, and Italy, have imposed retrospective taxes on companies.\n\nJudicial Role in Shaping Retrospective Amendments of Tax Laws\n\nRetrospective taxation has created significant turmoil in the recent past among foreign investors, resulting in numerous conflicts between the Indian government and major international companies such as Vodafone and Cairn. One of the most significant and contentious retrospective amendments was the inclusion of income generated from the indirect transfer of shares within the tax framework through the Finance Act of 2012.\n\nIn the Vodafone case, the Supreme Court ruled against the tax authorities to claim tax on capital gains obtained from the indirect transfer of shares of an Indian company when the primary transaction occurs between two foreign companies acquiring a foreign company that holds a majority stake in the Indian company. A huge magnitude of tax revenue was lost by the tax department as a result of the ruling. To claim its lost revenue back, the Government decided to amend Section 9 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 while presenting the financial budget for 2012. According to the amendment, 'shares or interests in any foreign company or entity would be considered situated in India if their substantial value is derived from assets located in India. Consequently, any capital gains arising from the transfer of such shares or interests in a foreign company, which derive substantial value from Indian assets, were subjected to taxation'. The government made this amendment applicable retrospectively from 1962. This meant that the Vodafone case, where the transactions had already taken place and a ruling had been issued by the Supreme Court, could be subjected to taxation with the application of this retrospective amendment.\n\nAnother landmark tussle involved the IT Department claiming a capital gains tax from Cairn UK Holdings Limited. This tax was imposed due to the internal corporate restructuring of Cairn UK in 2006, where the company transferred its entire stake in a subsidiary to Cairn India. Subsequently, Cairn India carried out an Initial Public Offering, selling approximately 30% of its shares to the mining conglomerate Vedanta PLC. Cairn Energy challenged the legitimacy of the imposed tax and initiated an international arbitration process to contest retrospective taxation. In 2020, the arbitration tribunal in The Hague ruled that the Indian government was required to pay over USD 1.2 billion in taxes to Cairn Energy, in addition to other amounts. Notably, Cairn also secured a verdict allowing the seizure of 20 assets owned by the Indian state in the United Kingdom.\n\nApproach of Supreme Court in Present Case\n\nIn the recent case before the Supreme Court, the matter in issue was the scope of interpretation of Section 153C in holding third parties accountable against whom incriminating material is found during an independent search. The assesses heavily relied on the Delhi High Court judgement of 2014 which interpreted the provision in a narrow manner, thereby protecting the interests of such third parties. However, the Supreme Court highlighted that this narrow interpretation was rectified by the 2015 amendment to Section 153C giving it the broader meaning which was initially intended by the legislation.\n\nThe main issue before the apex court in the current case was regarding the applicability of the 2015 amendment. The court traced down the legislative intent of the amendment and determined that the amendment was brought to empower the tax authorities to take action against third parties against whom incriminating material is found in an independent search. The intent of the amendment can be fully satisfied only if the amendment is applied retrospectively, thus enabling it to rectify the errors made by previous judgements. \n\nChallenges and Rectifications\n\nIn general, a taxing statute is usually preferred to be prospective. The simple reason for that is that while paying the tax, the taxpayer must have knowledge of the expenditure to be made. They can thereby, carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed transaction and ascertain whether or not to deal in such a transaction. Such retrospective tax amendment may affect a current agreement, may lead to the reopening of a completed transaction, disturb the tax planning of corporations, variation in accrued rights and remedies of the parties involved, and even at times affect the whole of the procedure involved.\n\nThe retrospective application of tax statutes by the legislature is allowed but the same is subject to constitutional limitations. However, in reality, it is often utilized by the legislature with the intent to supersede the effect of judicial decisions. The constitutional limitation implies that tax laws can be struck down if found violative of Article 19. That is if they are discriminatory and put unreasonable restrictions on one’s freedom to carry out their profession making it unduly burdensome and harsh.\n\nThe question of the constitutionality of retrospective tax amendments also came up in the case of Electronics Corporation of India Limited v. CIT, where the presumption of constitutionality of such retrospective amendment was contested upon being discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution to the extent that it treated un-equals as equals.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that retrospective amendments in taxation laws should not be treated as a general practice but only a rare occurrence in case urgent intervention is required to prevent revenue loss. Although the government stood strong against Cairn Energy, the mounting pressure led to another amendment in the tax laws by the Indian government. On 5 August 2021, the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021 was proposed to completely eliminate the provisions of retrospective taxation. This amendment thus rectified the anomaly created by the 2012 amendment.\n\nConclusion and Suggestions\n\nThe recent ruling by the Supreme Court in respect of the retrospective application of the Section 153C amendment has sparked discussions on the concept of retrospective amendments in taxation laws in India. Retrospective taxes have been a contentious issue globally, and India’s experience has been no different. The 2012 amendment caused significant turmoil, leading to legal battles and revenue losses for the tax department.\n\nThe government’s introduction of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill in 2021, eliminating the provisions of retrospective taxation, was a significant step towards resolving the issue and creating an investment-friendly environment. The Supreme Court also recognized the interests of taxpayers regarding retrospective tax amendments while protecting the legislative intent of tax statutes in its recent ruling. The government should also acknowledge that maintaining a stable and predictable tax system is essential for fostering private-sector investment. With the elimination of the unreasonable retrospective tax regime, India is anticipated to inspire trust in the country’s regulatory and tax framework among private investors.\nTaxationRetrospectivityIncome-Tax ActVodafone\nTaxation Law\n41 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Testing National Financial Information Registry Framework on the Touchstone of Data Protection Law",
        "content": "Parth Kantak\nSep 9\n7 min read\nTesting National Financial Information Registry Framework on the Touchstone of Data Protection Law\n[Parth is a student at National Law School of India University.]\n\nThis article discusses the policy surrounding the National Financial Information Registry (NFIR) that was mooted in the Annual Budget speech by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February 2023. The aims and implications of the policy are highly significant for credit lending and financial inclusion, and it is surely posed to cause buzz in the finance world once the draft of the policy is released. \n\nAs will be gathered by the nature of the policy, data lies at the core of it and that too at a large scale. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDPA) has been recently enacted and has become  the relevant law governing data protection in India. Its enactment is bound to have crucial impacts on the policy and implementation of the NFIR. This article analyses the broader idea of the NFIR by examining its framework and tests it on the touchstone of the DPDPA to gauge how it would fare and the potential challenges that would need to be considered in the framing of the policy. \n\nThe manner in which this article conducts this analysis is that it first details the foundations of the NIFR, including its conceptual underpinnings, policy implications and potential scope.  It then examines how the provisions of the DPDPA impact the framework and implementation of the NFIR. It also makes suggestions for the efficient implementation of the policy. It thereafter concludes with a brief take on how the policy works to the benefit of the financial health of the country.\n\nLaying Down the NFIR Framework: Appraisal of the Policy\n\nNFIR is a database that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is planning to set up to collate credit and ancillary information that relates to the determination of credit-worthiness of an entity as was mentioned in the Annual Budget in February 2023. The RBI Governor claims that it will enable the lenders to avail a “360-degree” perspective to determine the credit-worthiness of potential borrowers. The registry is intended to facilitate framing of better macro policies, promote financial inclusion, efficient credit flow, and create financial stability. Therefore, it is a boon to the credit landscape of the country.\n\nThe NFIR has also been termed as a ‘old wine in a new bottle’ version of the Public Credit Registry (PCR) which was announced by the RBI in 2018 and had a framework akin to the NFIR. However, not much was accomplished on that front apart from a report by the High Level Task Force. \n\nThe framework of the registry plans to not allow the data to be used for the purpose of the registry unless the entity whose data is being provided gives consent for the same, which acts as a blanket prohibition. Therefore, since the registry follows similar patterns as the DPDPA with respect to empowerment of the data principal (DP) which is the entity providing its data, it is pertinent to examine how the provisions of the DPDPA may have significant implications for the same. \n\nImpact of the DPDP 2023 on the NFIR Framework and Other Issues\n\nTo understand the overlap between NFIR and DPDPA, it is crucial to examine the consent acquisition policy of the framework and the implications of DPDPA. As mentioned above, according to the RBI statement, the entities would hold the right to give permission to provide their data. Section 4(1)(a) of the DPDPA lays down that only the data which has been consented to by the DP can be processed by the data fiduciary (DF). Moreover, under Section 6(4), the DP also reserves the right to withdraw the data provided to the DF at any time. This can be detrimental to the maintenance of the NFIR as will be established hereon. \n\nThe logic behind the NFIR is that it will function as a registry that will be a repository of credit and ancillary information such as corporate balance sheet information, tax information, utility bill payments information, etc. This serves the purpose of the stakeholders such as the lenders to have a constant dataset to gauge the credit trends, since it is a registry to obtain an appropriate understanding of the risk associated in engaging in activities such as lending with the entities in the dataset. However, if the DP decides to withdraw some part of his data or all his data, this will strike at the purpose of the registry since the purpose of a registry is to have data stored for a long period of time for it to have utility. The lack of a constant dataset would make the information asymmetry continue to persist. \n\nFurther, the government cannot assume consent of the DP i.e., entities participating in NFIR. This is due to the fact that the substantive content of Section 7 under the DPDPA has been altered from Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022. Previously, in the 2022 bill, the equivalent provision was ‘deemed consent’ in Section 8 where the consent of the DP was assumed in certain circumstances such as for the performance of any function under any law. However, in DPDPA, the provision is termed as ‘certain legitimate uses’ without any deeming of consent.  \n\nThe interpretation of the section as given in DPDPA has posed a tad bit of ambiguity as has been read by certain eminent legal practices. However, if plainly interpreted from the reading of the provision, it implies that government cannot assume consent for certain situations as it did in the 2022 bill. This makes it favourable to the DP to control their data by themselves and also withdraw it on their discretion. Consequentially, when applied to NFIR, it dilutes the utility that the registry could have had otherwise. \n\nThis issue is accentuated by Section 8(7)(a) and (b) of DPDPA wherein the DF is mandated to erase the data provided by the DP or cause the data processor to erase it, unless its retention is necessary to comply with any law that is in force. Therefore, unless there is such a law, the DF i.e., NFIR in this case, would not be able to retain the data which will refute the purpose of NFIR which is to provide information to further predictability. \n\nMoreover, if this is let to happen, the purpose of the project would be negated due to the effectiveness of alternatives such as the account aggregator (AA) framework. In the AA framework, the consent requirements are the same as that mentioned in the DPDPA and the credit is not provided unless the borrower provides consent for the data requirements to avail the credit. This indirectly serves a similar function as the NFIR does i.e., providing all the necessary information to the service provider, without having to collect data in a registry format, therefore having a suitable policy for NFIR is necessary.\n\nTherefore, for the practical utility of the NFIR to prevail, there would need to be a provision in the legislative enactment backing NFIR. This provision would have to require the DP providing the data, to keep it within the registry for a certain period so that the credit institutions have a better dataset to set the interest rates and study the situation of credit-worthiness of entities (trend analysis). This can be facilitated under Section 7(c) and (d) of the DPDPA which allows the DF to process data for the state or any of its instrumentalities to fulfill any function if there is any law in force at the time in India that mandates the same. This solution can be made better by making allowances for deanonymizing the data provided, to use it for the purpose of trend analysis without compromising privacy. However, this being a predominantly technical solution, it is difficult to comment upon its viability as compared to a legislative solution although it is desirable.\n\nThe second element deals with the compliance burden. The DPDPA places a heavy compliance burden on DFs and especially the significant DFs under Section 10 in the form of providing notices, obtaining granular consent, having complex security systems in place, appoints data officers, conducting regular data audits, etc. This leads to an inference that the compliance burden on the state for the implementation of NFIR is going to be quite high since the state is a DF which can be implied from a combined reading of Section 2(i) and (s) and can also be potentially classified as a significant DF. Therefore, it becomes imperative that while framing of the policy, RBI takes into consideration the compliance burden that will have to be adhered to with the setting up of the repository. \n\nThe third front which warrants attention of RBI is that of the cyber security of the data stored in the registry. The data comprises of credit and ancillary related information which is highly sensitive form of data. Moreover, India in the last couple of years has been subjected to a number of malware and ransomware attacks, possibly by hostile neighboring countries, with several of them being targeted towards databases. This poses a serious threat to the sensitive data that NFIR would contain. Therefore, bringing in extensive provisions that set a high threshold of security which is to be maintained by the registry is imperative to foster resilience as provided in Section 8(4) and (5) of the DPDPA. These can be emulated from the guidelines framed for the AA system and also the recommendations given in the high-level task force report on PCR. These frameworks also face a similarly considerable threat due to their infrastructure and information retained by them being sensitive as these also carries the information for other financial services. \n\nThese three fronts are in addition to the inherent factors that need to be deliberated for the legislative enactment backing the NFIR. These factors relate to the various elements of the framework, including the uniqueness of the registry as compared to other data repositories, the extent of ‘ancillary information’ that will be stored in the registry, the types of entities are covered by the registry, the potential sources of this data, extent of access to the information provided, etc. It is crucial to determine these factors as they play an integral role in how NFIR impacts businesses and the economic situation of the country. However, since the scope of this article is restricted to testing the application of DPDPA, the article does not dig deeper in these issues.\n\nConclusion: The Way Forward\n\nThis analysis essentially boils down to two elements- first, regarding how the NFIR would fare based on the newly passed DPDPA and second, the inherent considerations of the policy. Therefore, by providing crucial inputs to the policy of the NFIR, the article has aimed to aid in shaping the policy to suit the interests of maximum number of stakeholders and to the business that would be generated from putting this system in place. The successful implementation of the policy is fundamental since it has potential to improve India’s credit landscape manifold and will hold in good stead for the financial health of the country.\nDPDPDigital Personal Data Protection ActNFIRRBIData Protection\nCommercial Law\n•\nLaw and Policy\n72 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Towards Murky Waters: On the Supreme Court’s Questionable Ruling in Loop Telecom and Trading Limited",
        "content": "Harshal Chhabra, Rishabh Shivani\nSep 7\n6 min read\nTowards Murky Waters: On the Supreme Court’s Questionable Ruling in Loop Telecom and Trading Limited\n[Harshal and Rishabh are students at Gujarat National Law University and National Law School of Indian University, respectively.]\n\nThe Supreme Court recently dealt with the interplay between Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Act) and its exception in pari delicto potior est defendentis, which denies restitution if both parties are equally at fault, in the controversial ruling in Loop Telecom and Trading Limited v Union of India (Loop Telecom).\n\nThe suit arose from the famous 2G scam, as Loop Telecom’s 2G spectrum licence was quashed by the Supreme Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India (CPIL) on account of the spectrum allocation scheme being illegal, arbitrary, and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Therefore, Loop Telecom claimed a refund of its entry fee under Section 65 of the Act. In determining whether Loop Telecom was at equal fault with the government or not, the court held in the affirmative, finding that Loop Telecom willingly entered into the agreement, knowing its illegality, and benefitted from the same. Therefore, it was considered in pari delicto with the government and its claim for restitution was rejected. \n\nIn this piece, we analyze the Supreme Court’s ruling and argue that it has created uncertainty regarding the application of the maxim in government contracts. First, we analyze the general approach of courts while applying the maxim, and show how Loop Telecom demonstrated a similar approach. We then highlight the exception to this approach which is adopted in government contracts, and argue that the court ignored this exception in the instant case, thereby creating uncertainty and presenting unwanted and inequitable consequences which go against the very purpose of the maxim. \n\nLoop Telecom and the Courts’ ‘Conventional’ Approach\n\nConventionally, courts apply a two-pronged test of knowledge and will to ascertain the extent of fault of parties. The test entails that if the plaintiff knew about the illegality of the agreement and entered into the agreement with free will, despite such knowledge, they are considered to be in pari delicto with the defendant and are not entitled to restitution.  For instance, in Kuju Collieries Limited v. Jharkhand Mines Limited and Others, the Supreme Court held that Section 65 is applicable only when either party does not know about the illegality of the agreement. This view was affirmed in Mohd Salimuddin v. Misri Lal and Another, where the court clarified that the maxim is attracted only when “both parties have voluntarily and by their free will joined hands to flout the law for mutual gain”. Thus, the conventional practice is to determine whether the parties entered into the agreement voluntarily and with the knowledge of the illegality.\n\nHas the Supreme Court applied the same practice in the instant case? The short answer is yes. The court used the aforementioned precedents to hold that the legal footing of the parties, i.e., their knowledge and will to enter into the illegal agreement, was the only relevant factor while determining the extent of their fault. Consequently, the court relied on CPIL and the INR 50 lakh cost imposed on Loop Telecom therein to hold that it was a beneficiary of the illegal scheme, and therefore, had prior knowledge of the scheme’s illegality. Despite such knowledge, it entered into the agreement, indicating willingness on its part. Thus, the court held that since Loop Telecom knew about the illegality and agreed to the contract willingly, it was on the same legal footing as the State and was therefore in pari delicto.\n\nThis shows that the court’s approach in the instant case aligned with the usual practice of the courts, as it used the same test of knowledge and relief to deny relief to Loop Telecom. That, however, does not vindicate it from criticism, as the court has erroneously applied this conventional approach.\n\nIgnorance of Law: A Disregard of the Exception to the Exception\n\nThe maxim in pari delicto est potior defendeteris is an exception to the general rule of restitution contemplated in Section 65. However, merely because the general principles for its application are fulfilled does not mean that it will, in every scenario, be applied. Exceptions have been carved out in India through case law, particularly in government contracts, where even if the parties entered into the agreement voluntarily and with knowledge, they were still allowed compensation for losses incurred by them.\n\nFor instance, in Humanity and Another v. State of West Bengal, the appellant was allotted a plot but later requested the government to exchange it for a larger plot. It was then allotted the larger plot without floating any advertisement or conducting an auction, as required under the law. The court found the government’s actions to be unreasonable and arbitrary, as it unfairly benefitted the appellant by denying opportunities to other interested competitors, and cancelled the allotment. Interestingly, despite the appellant's voluntary complicity in entering into the agreement, the Court still directed the State to compensate the appellant—a claim which would not have otherwise been allowed under the conventional approach.\n\nFurther, in Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others, the appellant had challenged the process adopted by the State for reserving and allotting land to a trust, claiming that it was meant to unfairly benefit the trust. The court quashed the allotment, holding that the scheme was unfair, arbitrary and violative of Article 14. Here as well, the State was directed to compensate the trust despite the trust’s apparent complicity in the transaction. In New India Public School and Others v. HUDA, the appellants benefited from an illegal plot allotment process, leading to a court-ordered fresh allotment. Here, like in the previous cases, the court allowed compensation to the appellants despite their prior knowledge of the scheme’s illegality.\n\nHence, it is evident that courts have not applied the two-pronged test of knowledge and voluntariness in government contracts, and private parties can get compensation even if they were actively or passively complicit. \n\nWas the 2G scam then a peculiar scenario such that cases of restitution arising out of it were not hit by this rule? The answer seems no, remarkably when this rule has been applied in other cases, similar to Loop Telecom, arising out of CPIL. For example, in S Tel v. Union of India (S Tel), S Tel sought a refund after its 3G spectrum license was annulled by CPIL. While it was an indirect beneficiary like Loop Telecom, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) still allowed the refund, holding that the license cancellation was not S Tel's fault. In fact, TDSAT considered it a “classic case of restitution”. Furthermore, in Unitech Wireless (TN) Private Limited v Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Others, TDSAT held that no fault could be attributed to Unitech for the cancellation of licences as it was a circumstance beyond its control, even though it had directly benefited from the scheme. This holding was subsequently accepted by the Supreme Court. Since Loop Telecom has a similar factual scenario as these cases, it is natural to assume that the ruling would be similar. However, in the present case, the court still applied the test of voluntariness and knowledge and disregarded the exceptions to the same to deny relief to Loop Telecom.\n\nWhy did the court then adopt a different approach in the instant case? Should this case be considered an exception to the government contract-centric approach, or does it change that approach itself?\n\nThe questions remain unanswered as the Supreme Court overlooked relevant precedents and the prevailing position of law. Although it did refer to the S Tel judgement, it failed to provide adequate reasoning to distinguish it from the present situation and disregarded the fact that S Tel, which was similarly placed to Loop Telecom, was not considered responsible for the cancellation of its licence. Instead, the court conveniently adhered to conventional practices to deny relief to Loop Telecom.\n\nEvidently, the ruling appears to be per incuriam and an aberration from what was a consistent and just position of law. This poses troubling consequences. Firstly, it has made uncertain the application of the maxim to government contracts, as courts will now have to decide whether to disregard and distinguish this ruling or treat it as the new position of law. Secondly, the ruling has opened the floodgates for unjust enrichment of the State, as it may deny restitution to private parties who knew about the illegality of the arrangement but entered into the contract under the pressure of losing out to competitors. Lastly, parties who did not know about the illegality and only indirectly benefited from the arrangement would also be unsuccessful under Section 65 as courts may infer the benefit to mean knowledge of the illegality as done in Loop Telecom. This is not only inequitable but also creates uncertainty and the potential for unwanted consequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe principle in pari delicto potior est defendentis is not absolute and is also subject to exceptions. One such exception highlighted above is in government contracts, where courts allow claims of restitution even though the private parties had knowledge of the illegality and were directly or indirectly complicit. This exception was ignored by the Supreme Court in Loop Telecom, which erroneously applied the conventional approach to deny relief to the appellants. The ruling is an aberration from the existing position of law and has made the application of the maxim uncertain in government contracts. It therefore presents unwanted consequences in future cases by allowing for unjust enrichment of the State at the expense of private parties, which is inequitable and attacks the very purpose of the maxim.\nin pari delicto potior est defendentisSection 65Indian Contract ActLoop TelecomSupreme Court\nCommercial Law\n269 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "Arbitration in India: Why Some Cases Linger for Years Before Resolution?",
        "content": "Arya Tiwari, Trilok Choudhary\nSep 6\n5 min read\nArbitration in India: Why Some Cases Linger for Years Before Resolution?\n[Arya and Trilok are students at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\n“The difficulty of the litigants starts when they have obtained the decree”. This remark was made by the Supreme Court in General Manager of the Raj Durbhunga v. Coomar Ramaput Singh while expressing deep concern over a striking instance of arbitration proceeding. In this case, an award was issued in 1992, but the execution petition to enforce the award was filed in 2003 which remains unresolved to this day. It is disheartening to observe that even after the passage of 30 years, the party in whose favor the award was granted has been unable to reap the benefits of the legal victory. The execution petition has been pending for more than 20 years, resulting in an extremely unfortunate and protracted situation Satyawati v. Rajinder Singh and Another. This prolonged delay, spanning over two decades, in the execution proceedings to enforce the arbitral award is a matter of great regret. In 2021, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court issued directions to the executing courts, urging them to resolve execution proceedings within a period of 6 months which was again reiterated by the two-judge bench in 2022 in Rahul S Shah v. Jinendra Kumar Gandhi.\n\nSource of Delay, a Legal Conundrum\n\nThe question of why we still witness cases like these, where arbitration matters linger for almost three decades and end up in the halls of the apex court, requires an examination of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (1996 Act) and the current state of arbitration in India. Despite the numerous advantages of arbitration, such as party autonomy and a customized procedure for dispute resolution, many parties seem to struggle to access justice through this mechanism. By closely analyzing the existing provisions of the 1996 Act and the prevailing state of arbitration in India, we can better understand the reasons behind these prolonged and unresolved disputes.\n Section 36 of the 1996 Act holds immense significance in the enforcement of arbitration awards. After the expiry of the 3-month period, which can be extended by an additional 30 days under Section 34, and in the absence of any court-ordered stay on execution as per Section 36(3) of the 1996 Act, the court treats the award as if it were a regular decree. Subsequently, it enforces the award using the procedures laid out in the Civil Procedure Code 1908 (CPC), assuming there are no substantial reasons to suggest otherwise. The adoption of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution method was driven by considerable delays experienced in the traditional judicial system. Arbitration aimed to streamline the resolution process, ensuring efficiency and promptness. Parties were granted the flexibility to opt for arbitration either before or after a dispute emerged, allowing them to select arbitrators with expertise in the relevant field and tailor the procedure for a swift resolution. All of this was intended to avoid the unnecessary delays often encountered when dealing with conventional judiciary. \n\nHowever, despite these advantages, there is a notable drawback. The 1996 Act does not provide a specific procedure for executing arbitral awards (emphasis supplied). As a consequence, the award-holder often finds themselves compelled to approach the very same courts they sought to avoid by choosing arbitration, thus negating some of the intended benefits of this alternate dispute-resolution mechanism. The delay in the execution stage of decrees can be attributed to the complexities within Order XXI of the CPC. This order outlines the rules and procedures for executing decrees, consisting of an extensive collection of 106 rules (Rules 60 to 63 omitted) governing stay of execution, mode of execution, attachment procedures to fulfil the decree, and adjudication of claims and objections. The mechanisms laid out in Order XXI offer numerous avenues for judgment debtors to evade liability by filing unnecessary appeals, applications, objections, or even the non-disclosure of their assets. These tactics lead to prolonged proceedings and hinder the timely enforcement of decrees. However, it is not solely the fault of judgment debtors for prolonging the execution process. The courts themselves often prioritize the adjudication of petitions and suits over the execution of decrees, leading to further delays. \n\nThis imbalance in priorities is an ironic and lamentable aspect of the system, perpetuating the travesty of justice for those seeking prompt resolution and enforcement of their rights. The 1996 Act sets a maximum time limit of 18 months (from the date of completion of pleadings) for concluding proceedings and issuing an award, with the possibility of extension granted by the court if valid reasons for the delay are provided. However, there is a significant paradox in the 1996 Act - while it aims to ensure speedy resolution of disputes through arbitration, there is no specified time limit for executing and enforcing the awarded decisions (emphasis supplied). This contradiction becomes evident in Section 29B of the 1996 Act, introduced in the 2015 amendment, which established a fast-track procedure for resolving disputes and passing awards within six months. The intention was to expedite the arbitration process. However, the moment an award is issued, it must go through the court for execution, without any special provision for promptly executing fast-track awards. As a result, the benefits derived from the fast-track procedure are nullified by the subsequent delays in executing these awards. The award essentially becomes a paper tiger until it is successfully enforced. The absence of a specified time frame for executing arbitral awards hinders the realization of the core objective of the 1996 Act - providing efficient and speedy resolution of disputes. The delays in executing these awards contradict the very essence of the fast-track procedure introduced to accelerate the arbitration process, leading to a gap between the intention and the practical implementation of the 1996 Act. In 2022, the Supreme Court made a significant observation, emphasizing that “India cannot hope to become an international arbitration hub unless arbitration awards are effectively enforced”. The remark came in response to a 2017 award of INR 7,200 crores in favor of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in the case of Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited. An arbitral award lacking provisions for speedy disposal is detrimental to the entire arbitration process. To address this issue, not only legislative reforms are necessary but also a thorough reconsideration of procedural aspects.  \n\nData Analysis \n\nThe following data is taken from the National Judicial Data Grid, and it is often used to showcase an increase in the rate of disposal of execution suits in arbitration matters, which would suggest that the legal machinery is improving drastically over the course of less than a decade (data is between 2016 and 2023). However, it is argued that the data could be misleading, since the matters that are being disposed of may be pending for more than a few decades, whereas the cases instituted are on a per year basis, meaning that being newer suits, they pile on the existing caseload, whereas the disposed matters are likely not of the nature of being instituted recently. We can further support this counter view by highlighting the pendency in the disposal of execution petitions across Indian courts, who are tasked with the job of executing arbitral awards, in a data range spanning across the past 30 years and beyond. \n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo improve the enforcement of arbitration awards, one crucial step is to establish more benches dedicated to the time-bound disposal of execution petitions, as repeatedly urged by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, with the Indian government’s increasing inclination towards institutional arbitration over ad hoc arbitration, it is advisable to empower these specialized institutions to both render and execute awards (emphasis supplied). Creating a dedicated body for delivering and enforcing awards can streamline the process and eliminate the involvement of regular courts. Alternatively, there is scope for reevaluating and simplifying the procedures outlined in the CPC specifically for executing arbitral awards. Trimming down the existing procedure could expedite the enforcement process and align it better with the underlying principles of arbitration - efficiency and prompt resolution. In conclusion, addressing the enforcement challenges surrounding arbitration awards requires a comprehensive approach. Legislative reforms, empowering specialized institutions, and rethinking procedural aspects are all critical steps to make India a more attractive destination for international arbitration and ensure effective dispute resolution.\n\n\nArbitration and ConciliationArbitration ActCivil Procedure Code\nDispute Resolution\n199 views\n16 likes.

        "title": "Promoters v/s Persons in Control and its Effect on ESOP Regulations",
        "content": "Gunjan Modi\nSep 3\n5 min read\nPromoters v/s Persons in Control and its Effect on ESOP Regulations\n[Gunjan is a student at National Law School of India University, Bengaluru.]\n\nAn employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a scheme which is formulated by a company to provide employees with the option to buy its shares at a pre-determined price, which isolates the benefits that the employee can gain from such shares from any increase in purchasing price of shares during public issue. In doing so, a company has to carefully formulate a plan keeping in mind that the interests of its employees, on one hand, and its investors, on the other, are not in conflict. \n\nPreviously, there were two regulations that dealt with ESOPs; the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Sweat Equity) Regulations 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations 2014. These two regulations have recently been amalgamated into one regulation which is called the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefit and Sweat Equity) Regulations 2021 (New Regulations). The objective behind this amalgamation is to streamline the procedure to grant ESOPs and rationalize the provisions of the regulations in accordance to global practices which will result in ease of doing business. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also acknowledged that since both the regulations essentially deal with providing employee benefits through issuance of equity shares, an amalgamation of the regulations is a possibility. \n\nThis blog restricts itself to the research question of analysing the implications of SEBI's proposal to shift from the concept of ‘promoters’ to 'persons in control', in the New Regulations. The author analyses the arguments against Paytm’s move to issue ESOP to its founder, Mr Vijay Shekhar Sharma in order to understand the reasoning behind SEBI’s move and contrast its effect on the applicability of these regulations.\n\nThe New Regulations expressly prohibited grant of ESOPs to promoter or promoter groups as when we read the definition of 'promoter' under Section 92 of the Companies Act, 2013, promoters cannot be considered as ‘employees’. Recently in 2023, Paytm was criticized for granting ESOPs to its founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Vijay Shekhar Sharma, on grounds that even if Mr Sharma was not classified as a promoter of Paytm, he nevertheless was a person in control who had similar rights and obligations as that of a promoter. Such criticism comes from the recently proposed shift by SEBI from the concept of promoters to persons in control as proposed in a consultation paper dated 1 May 2021.\n\nIn this consultation paper, SEBI justifies the need for this change due to the increasing change in the ownership patterns in the companies. Such change is seen in the form of private and institutional investors having substantial control and voting rights in the company, in comparison to its promoters. Such a shift also indicates the intention of the regulator to move towards qualitative enhancement of corporate governance by focusing more on the role of Board of Directors of a company. In such cases, the promoter, even without having substantial control, might be responsible for the company which creates a gap in the systematic functioning of the company as well as leaves a gray area in the “accountability” aspect of management. Looking at this shift from the perspective of the investors, the falling control in the hands of a promoter might be detrimental to the interests of investors as when only identified promoters/promoter groups are known to the investors, people who are actually in control of the company might be unknown, causing a break in the chain of effective information and decision-making considerations for them. \n\nConsidering these aspects to the Paytm’s case, Mr Sharma being the founder, CEO and non-retiring director on the Board of Directors, has significant control over Paytm’s operations and management bringing him under the ambit of 'persons in control'. \n\nWith no mention of 'persons in control' in the New Regulations, it seems to opt for the concept of 'promoters' instead. This section of the paper argues that this is untrue as on a reading on the definition of 'control' under the New Regulations, along with the definition of 'promoter' under Section 69(6)(a) of the Companies Act 2013 and the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018 (ICDR Regulations), it can be interpreted that both the concepts can be applied for the purposes of these regulations. \n\nWithout diving deep into the question of which of the two, promoters or persons in control, is better, the author argues that for the purposes of these regulations, instead of a complete shift in the promoters to persons in control, there should be a streamlining of the two concepts; It should include promoters who were the founders and initial brains behind the incorporation of the company, as well as new private and institutional equity shareholders with substantial shareholding to ensure that in no case the interests of employees are compromised. The rationale behind this argument is that there can be scenarios where even if a promoter no longer has substantial shareholding in the company, he / she might have a strong influence over the management of the company, whereas a private / institutional equity shareholder might have a substantial control over the company by the way of voting rights. Section 62(6)(a) of the Companies Act 2013 defines a 'promoter' and it provides that a promoter is “who was a party to the preparation of the prospectus or of the portion thereof containing the untrue statement”. This expresses the intention of the drafters of the act to hold those liable who were initially involved in the incorporation or major decisions such as an IPO of the company. However, it is pertinent to note that this definition doesn’t recognize the act of promoting a company as a criterion for being classified as a promoter.\n\nThe inclusion of both the concepts ensures that the benefits of the employees are not sidelined due to influential persons and substantial shareholders of the company who might have a say in how stock options are granted to the employees. This rationale is reflected in the definition of a 'promoter' under the ICDR Regulations, Regulation 2(1)(oo) of which provides that 'promoter shall include a person who has control over the affairs of the issuer'. Such an aspect of 'control' being included in the definition can help in finding a middle ground for the two clashing concepts. Further, the New Regulations provide that 'control' shall have the same meaning as that given under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011 (Acquisition Regulations). Under the Acquisition Regulations, in Regulation 2 (1)(e), 'control' is defined as 'right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions' which can be done by 'virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements or in any other manner'. This broad definition which includes the aspects of control by shareholding or control by way of management rights further shows that promoters and persons in control are both considered to have substantial control for the purposes of the Acquisition Regulations. It is suggested by the author that through analysis and interpretation, a clarification by the regulator on this point will be ideal to ensure that there are no discrepancies and confusion when a stock option scheme is being formulated by a company. This is essential because it will clarify the stance of the law on whether ESOPs can be granted to persons in control or not.\n\nThe regulator, by the way of amendment to the applicability and procedure of issuing stock options to its employees, has brought in several desirable changes that enable a more efficient and easy grants of stock options to its employees. This article looked into some of the notable changes brought in by way of the New Regulations. It analyzed the provisions of the New Regulations and argued that even though there is no mention of persons in control in the New Regulations, it can be read into the law due the language and scope thereof. \nESOPsSEBIShare Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity Regulations\nCorporate Law\n•\nLabour Law\n180 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Finfluencers Need To Fall Under the Regulatory Lens",
        "content": "Parul Anand\nSep 1\n6 min read\nFinfluencers Need To Fall Under the Regulatory Lens\n[Parul is a student at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\nThe introduction of novel financial technologies (fintech) has resulted into more than just the introduction of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other Web3 financial supplements; it has also created the rise of a notable entity, the “finfluencer”. A portmanteau of the words finance and influencer, finfluencers do exactly what you think they would do — influence the public vis-à-vis their financial decisions through various internet based endeavours including but not limited to promotions and recommendations on social media. The global phenomenon has undeniably crept up in India and is raising concerns. A concerning faction of finfluencers is self-proclaimed finance experts who proffer financial advice which is unsubstantiated not only in quality, incredulous owing to lack of qualifications required by the party making them required to make it credible, and laden with hidden promotional tie-ups and commissions. It is specifically this segment that the governments around the world, including here at home, are intending to regulate for financial safety and well-being of the general public. \n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has started taking note of these instances, especially cases where finfluencers are offering investment and financial advice and charging for it without being registered with SEBI under the investment advisors (IA) framework first. A case in point is Gunjan Verma, who without being registered with SEBI, had been providing paid investment advice. A fine worth INR 1 lakh was imposed in addition to being asked to refunding all the money she has charged from her clients. Another case is of Syyed Shuhajauddin who earned more than INR 12 crores from running three Telegram channels and giving stock market tips to paid subscribers. SEBI ordered him and his firm, Kabir Financials, to stop dealing with securities, froze their assets and ordered impounding of the illegally earned money. Such an activity is doubly harmful — to consumers who are left at the behest of unqualified and unregulated financial advisors and to other financial advisors who are in fact registered with SEBI and follow the necessary legalities by resulting in unfair competition for them. These unregulated finfluencers pose a constant threat to the government as well since they escape participation in a necessary oversight mechanism which would make good governance possible. It then becomes glaringly obvious that regulation is the right way to go.\n\nAs necessary as the need for regulation seems, such a prospect is not without its opponents. It is argued that such regulation will (a) dis-incentivize finfluencers and innovation, (b) infringe on the freedom of speech, (c) impact the right to conduct trade / business / occupation, and (d)  be unnecessary since we have sufficient regulatory instruments where these activities may be covered. As compelling as these arguments may seem prima facie, they all come crashing down upon a closer examination. \n\nFirst, the idea that such regulation will dis-incentivize finfluencers has to be broken down in components. The regulation as contemplated only seeks to regulate the section of finfluencers involved in providing investment and financial advice online. The finfluencers that engage in providing general information about financial concepts or explicitly emphasise that they are engaging in providing their personal and not professional opinion are to be excluded from the regulatory lens. These sentiments echo in the statements made by Madhabi Puri Buch (Chairman, SEBI). Then, if this section becomes dis-incentivized owing to a heightened regulatory compliance mechanism, the same is, in the view of the author, undeniably appropriate as allowing it to remain otherwise will cause harm to consumers, other financial advisors and the government alike. \n\nSecond, the argument about how the impact of the regulation on the right to freedom of speech enshrined under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution also cannot withstand upon a close scrutiny.  At the end of the day, potentially fraudulent, misleading and irresponsible statements impacting a wide range of stakeholders should be regulated, and such regulation serves as a justifiable exception to the right to freedom of speech considering that Article 19 is subject to reasonable restrictions including for the purpose of maintaining public order. It is this form of speech that the regulations aim to cover by mandating disclaimers, disclosures and registrations before giving such advice. This is in no way different from regulating the speech by IAs who are performing the same function, offline or online. Additionally, “controlling” speech by mandating disclaimers for endorsements and affiliations is not new by any means. Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, and more recently, ‘Endorsements Know How’ guidelines released by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs concern the same subject matter. This insistence on differentiation between finfluencers and others on potentially the same subject matter then becomes not only incorrect but potentially violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution by allowing them to be treated differently by the state in the absence of regulation over the former. \n\nThird, the argument about such a regulation adversely affecting the right to work and livelihood  within the realm of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution also suffers from a profuse want of tenability upon a closer examination. As explored in the previous argument regarding free speech, the false dichotomy between IAs and finfluencers forms the operative premise for this conclusion. However, since the current regulation regarding IAs does not impinge on their right to work, there should be no concern per se regarding placing of a regulatory lens over finfluencers. There exist professional codes of conduct for almost every professional activity. Requiring finfluencers to follow consumer protection mandates and follow the IA framework and other guidelines acts as a device to put them in an organized legal framework where they engage in legal and healthy competition with the market, good-faith relationships with consumers, and correct standing with the government. \n\nFourth, the extant frameworks remain squarely insufficient to address this specific problem. There are general laws outlawing fraud, misrepresentation and the like, but there appears to be nothing that specially governs the operations of finfluencers. One might argue that IA framework could be used for the same purpose, but this is unlikely unless an amendment is effected in the IA regulations. The proviso to Regulation 2(1)(l) of the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations 2013 ousts any advice provided by electronic medium from its definition of ‘financial advice'. However, even if the same were covered, the problem of undisclosed affiliations and promotions would still remain unaddressed. Most importantly, there needs to be effected a clear delineation as to the kind of conduct by finfluencers that is to be regulated. Without defining such conduct anywhere, a regulatory vacuum exists leading to uncertainty, confusion and heightened fears of government control. There is suggestion that viewers are informed about the classification of financial information that they are provided. For instance, a piece of information could be classified as general financial information, opinion, or professional advice. A specialised regulatory framework will not only provide clarity to consumers but also discourage governmental overreach by discouraging over-expansive interpretations of provisions that would otherwise be relied upon. \n\nIt is, therefore, the need of the hour that a regulation governing finfluencers is effected. The Indian government’s current draft discussions on the same is a step in the right direction. The mandate for regulation is becoming even more imminent owing to the rise of cryptocurrencies, NFTs and other Web3 fintech applications and their confluence with finfluencers. Owing to the concerns that such elements are raising, the Advertising Standards Council of India released guidelines that mandate a disclaimer regarding virtual digital assets to be displayed whenever an influencer engages in a discussion about them. It has to be explicitly stated to the consumer that these products are highly risky, and any loss resulting from them is completely outside the regulatory purview. This is something that ought to be addressed most importantly in respect of finfluencers who themselves are outside the purview of all regulation and are actively promoting financial instruments that elude regulation as well. One such example is of finfluencers promoting Vauld, a Singapore based cryptocurrency firm that suspended all its transactions on 4 July 2022, leaving investors stranded. Consumers remarked that finfluencers misled them, and owing to absence of regulations in this regard, the consumers were left with no recourse. \n\nFor a country aiming to have strong consumer protection laws, the situation regarding finfluencers, especially vis-à-vis fintech tools, is dismal. Leaving a whole segment unchecked leaves the consumer vulnerable, notwithstanding any other argument.\nFinfluencersSEBIConsumerConsumer Protection\nCorporate Law\n•\nLaw and Policy\n135 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Navigating the Card Payment Landscape: Decoding RBI's Circular on Card Network Agreements",
        "content": "Nikita Parihar\nAug 29\n5 min read\nNavigating the Card Payment Landscape: Decoding RBI's Circular on Card Network Agreements\n[Nikita is a student at Lovely Professional University, School of Law, Punjab.]\n\nOn 5 July 2023, a draft circular on ‘Arrangements with Card Networks for the issue of Debit, Credit, and Prepaid Cards’ was issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in order to provide customers the liberty to decide the card network providers (CNPs) on the debit cards, credit cards, and prepaid cards. This step has been taken to by the RBI to: (i) enhance customer centricity in the current payment ecosystem; and (ii) protect customers rights and give them freedom of choice (which is curtailed due to exclusive agreement among the issuers and the CNP).\n\nThis article discusses the possible hurdles that may be faced while implementing the directions of the finalised circular and probable recommendations including that a further phased implementation by RBI can help in the smooth transformation. \n\nCurrent Framework and Challenges\n\nAt present, it is the autonomy of the issuing banks or financial institutions to decide the network provider for the customer. However, post issuance of this circular, RBI has made it clear to give customers the upper hand in determining which CNP they wish to have while taking cards. The certificates of authorization issued by the RBI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 for setting up and operating the payment system in India have been given to 5 card payment networks and only these networks have the authority to provide card networks to the issuers and ultimately, to the customers. In view of the competition, these CNPs enter into restrictive agreements with the issuers, ultimately resulting in limited options for the customers. Along with fewer options to the customers, these agreements also hurt  competition due to their exclusivity. At present, there is no framework to regulate the relationship between the CNP and the issuers, and this is governed by bilateral contracts. \n\nPhased Approach of RBI\n\nThe RBI wishes to make directions in Paragraphs 3(b) and (c) to be effective from 31 October 2023. Still, the circular needs to clarify the implementation of other parts such as Paragraph 3(a) i.e. card issuers shall not enter into any arrangement or agreement with card networks that restrain them from availing the services of other card networks. The potential reason for not making the above provision effective with the remaining portion of the circular can be due to current contractual obligations that the card issuers might have with the CNPs. Implementation of all the directions at once can be cumbersome for the issuer entities and the customers on account of additional compliance burden. Issuers might need some time to inculcate advanced technologies and a database of customers. Authentication and verification measures for customers wanting to port to other network providers will have to be implemented. In view of the above, a phased implementation can play a vital role. \n\nTransfer of Information From One Network Provider to Another\n\nThis circular will overhaul the whole functioning of the issuers and CNP as it will result insignificant changes to the current functionality, for example - the transfer of data of the customers at the time of porting. When an existing customer chooses to port his / her CNP under these directions, the data of the customer will need to be transferred between the network providers. This can not only be a cumbersome process, but also raise issues such as privacy and data protection. Specific guidelines for transferring CNP should be implemented – for example, once the data is transferred, it should be erased from the transferor’s database after a reasonable time.  In this context, the author suggests that subsequent directions should be issued after consultation with the stakeholders for proper collection, storage, and disposal of customers' data stored by the CNP. \n\nTokenization by CNP \n\nThe RBI on 7 September 2021 notified tokenization of card transactions in order to protect the sensitive data of customers while using online platforms. Earlier, tokens were also provided by CNPs – accordingly, in the event the customers are initiating portability, it is unclear on what will happen to such tokens created (for instance, will they be transferred or will new tokens be generated by the transferee CNP?). The RBI released a list of authorized entities of the token service providers with whom the service of tokenization can be availed, but the same is silent on the mechanism for cases of portability.\n Possible Hurdles and Recommendations for Implementation\n\nThe RBI's circular holds significant implications for the card network market. By providing customers with the freedom to choose their network provider, it fosters a more competitive landscape and encourages innovation. However, promoting financial literacy becomes paramount to ensure this initiative's success. Educating customers about the implications and benefits of different card networks will empower them to make informed decisions.\n\nAs per a survey mentioned in the RBI’s National Strategy for Financial Education: 2020-2025, only 27.18% of the participating people surpassed the minimum threshold of financial literacy in 2019, this very data raises concern about the influence that issuers might have over the rest 72.82 % of the population. \n\nFinancial literacy initiatives should focus on improving consumers understanding of the various CNP options available, their benefits, and the potential impact of their choices. Collaboration between regulators, financial institutions, and educational institutions can help bridge the knowledge gap and enable customers to make independent and informed choices.\n\nA potential hurdle lies in ensuring that customers are able to make unbiased choices without being swayed or influenced by card issuers. To address this concern, a comprehensive surveillance system must be put in place to monitor the actions of card issuers. Regulators should actively oversee the practices of these issuers, ensuring they adhere to the principles of transparency and fairness. By closely monitoring their marketing tactics and customer interactions, regulators can identify and prevent any attempts to unduly influence customers card network choices.\n\nThe other possible hurdle can be the definition or meaning of the term ‘eligible customers’ as referred to in Paragraph 3(c) of the draft circular which has not been clarified, thereby potentially leaving a room for card issuers to interpret the definition as per their convenience. To address this concern and ensure fairness, it would be advisable for the RBI to provide a clear and specific definition of an ‘eligible customer’ within the circular or through supplementary guidelines. This definition could include criteria such as minimum age, income thresholds, creditworthiness, or any other relevant factors to ensure that the eligibility of customers is determined objectively and uniformly across all card issuers. By establishing specific eligibility criteria, the RBI can mitigate the risk of manipulation by issuers who selectively designate customers as eligible based on their convenience. A transparent and standardized definition of ‘eligible customers’ would promote fairness, prevent discriminatory practices, and protect customers interests.\n\nIt would be beneficial for the RBI to consult with industry stakeholders, including consumer advocacy groups and card issuers, to develop a comprehensive definition of eligible customers that considers various perspectives and ensures a level playing field for all participants in the card issuance process.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia, being a developing country economically and digitally, has welcomed steps to protect and facilitate its stakeholders, and the RBI has played a critical role in maintaining and uplifting the objective of protecting customers. While awaiting the finalized circular, the author believes that it is crucial to provide ample time for issuers and CNP to adapt and implement the necessary changes, and other factors such as transfer of data and tokenization liabilities should also be considered. By addressing the above-mentioned challenges and (i) ensuring data security; (ii) promoting financial literacy; and (iii) establishing fair practices, the RBI can potentially create a competitive landscape that empowers customers to make informed choices regarding their card network providers. \nRBICard Network ProviderPayment and Settlement Systems ActTokenization\nCorporate Law\n133 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "The Ignored Conundrum of Competition Law during Hostile Takeovers in India",
        "content": "Aditi Singh, Saloni Neema\nAug 28\n6 min read\nThe Ignored Conundrum of Competition Law during Hostile Takeovers in India\n[Aditi and Saloni are students at Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University, Visakhapatnam.]\n\nThe Adani-NDTV takeover has re-kindled the debate regarding hostile takeovers in India. As the takeover continues to be discussed based on its validity and procedure, questions regarding its effect on the market alarm the economic regulators. The article engages with its implications on the competition between existing media players. The legal aspects of \"back-door\" takeovers in the Indian market are analyzed alongside the Competition Act 2002 and its interplay with a hostile takeover. The authors analyze how the Competition Commission of India (CCI) can prevent hostile takeovers and present a suggestive framework to prevent market monopoly.  \n\nDecoding the Adani-NDTV Takeover\n\nThe Adani-NDTV takeover was Adani's \"back-door\" entry into the NDTV management. Adani's failure to take the directors' consent before acquiring a majority stake in the company has made it a hostile takeover for the Indian market. The other side of the coin can be viewed through a contractual lens. The takeover by the Adani Group through AMG Media Networks Limited (AMNL) is merely implementing the penalty and failure to fulfil the contractual obligations. \n\nThe loan agreement between Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL) and RRPR Holding Private Limited (RRPR) was duly signed by both promoters. The promoters voluntarily entered into a contract whose breach would cause a loss to the company. The unusual design of the loan arrangement and the fact that if exercised, the warrant or call option would impact the company's operations was the beginning of the rocky road of the Adani-NDTV takeover. As signed by the promoters, the loan agreement was in the guise of a \"stake sale agreement\". By giving their consent to the unfavorable yet legal provisions of the loan agreement, the promoters agreed to a conditional share purchase agreement. They were accepting a loan worth INR 403 crores against INR 10 crore warrants of RRRR to VCPL. This, along with the right to purchase, resulted in an indirect sale of the equity shares, thus making a condition precedent for implementing the sale purchase clause.\n\nThe NDTV-Adani takeover was not only a power struggle among the companies but also caught the attention of the securities board. The failure to disclose the ramifications of the loan agreement, and the transfer of shares without requisite public announcement, incurred a liability and penalty upon the conglomerate. VCPL, acquiring a 26% stake in RRPR without appropriate disclosure, brought the transaction under SEBI's radar. The order dated 26 June 2018 directed VCPL to pay a 10% interest from the date of incurring liability to issue a public notice to the date of payment of consideration, to those who were holding shares in the target company.\n\nAt this juncture, the acquisition of NDTV with Adani has a majority stake of more than 55%. The indirect acquisition of 29%, along with the \"open-offer\" tactic, has led to NDTV being majorly controlled by Adani through its subsidiary AMNL.\n\nThe NDTV-Adani takeover has got the much-needed nod from the SEBI. The regulators have given a green flag, suggesting the deal is not problematic for the Indian market. Back-door entries as seen in the Adani-NDTV deal raise questions about competition in the market. The substantial control of a company, without preemptive measures, makes the market susceptible to monopoly. Thus, such takeovers need to be adequately monitored and regulated. \n\nHostile Takeover and the Competition Act 2002 Interplay\n\nAccording to the Competition Act 2002, any potential merger or acquisition that falls within the criteria under Section 5 must be compulsorily notified to the CCI. Section 6 prohibits any person from engaging in a combination that is likely to have an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India, and such a combination shall be void. If the CCI determines that the acquisition will hinder competition, it can order the acquiring company to sell off some of its assets or terminate the acquisition. The CCI has the authority to impose penalties on businesses that violate competition laws. The regulations related to hostile takeover can be found in the CCI (Procedure in regard to the Transaction of Business relating to Combinations) Regulations 2011. Regulation 9 of these regulations states that it is the responsibility of the acquirer to notify of an acquisition or a hostile takeover. Regulation 5(8) alters the 'other document' requirement under Section 6(2)(b) of the Competition Act 2002 for a hostile acquirer to notify the CCI of its intent to acquire an enterprise without the assent. In addition, Regulation 9(2) implicitly acknowledges that an acquirer may not be able to obtain all of the information required by the CCI to render a decision under Section 6 and therefore permits the acquirer to provide the available information.\n\nAs an example of a hostile takeover, consider the hostile takeover of Quidsi, in which Amazon monitored baby products sold on its platform and forcibly acquired diapers.com pursuant to an unpleasant price war. This was achieved by undercutting Quidsi's prices and compelling Quidsi to sell its business to Amazon. Small competitors will be compelled to transfer their businesses to Amazon or risk being driven out of the market. This hinders innovation and eliminates any incentive to invest further in R&D, considering these tech titans' threat of hostile takeovers.\n\nThe acquirer submitted an application for CCI approval on 19 March 2019, in Combination Registration Number C-2019/03/652 for the L&T-Mindtree takeover, identifying the following markets as relevant, namely, (a) the broad relevant market for the provision of information technology (IT) and information technology enabled services (ITES) in India; or (b) the narrow relevant markets for the provision of the following services in India: (i) IT consulting; (ii) hardware support services; (iii) IT implementation services; (iv) customer software support services; (v) IT outsourcing services; and (vi) IT engineering services. \n\nThe CCI decided to leave the precise delineation of the relevant market open because it has determined that the proposed combination is unlikely to have a significant adverse effect on competition in any of the potential alternative relevant markets. CCI further observed that the combined market share of L&T and Mindtree in India's IT and ITES sectors is negligible and between 0% and 5%. It was noted that there are other significant market participants, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Infosys, HCL, Tech Mahindra, and others. In light of the foregoing, the CCI approved the proposed transaction and determined that it was unlikely to impact competition in India significantly. The CCI approval was received as of 4 April 2019. \n\nAlthough this sanction was granted relatively quickly, it prompted competition policymakers, specifically the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), to investigate possible competition law obstacles in hostile takeovers in India. \n\nIn its report published in July 2019, shortly after the CCI's order in the L&T-Mindtree case, the CLRC determined that “…mandating a standstill on acquiring of shares pending the approval of the combination may hamper the viability of acquisitions via public bids”. Currently, the Competition Act 2002 prohibits parties from acquiring any interests in a proposed combination pending CCI approval. To facilitate such transactions and promote business convenience in India, the CLRC suggested that the standstill obligations be weakened during hostile takeovers. \n\nConclusion\n\nHostile takeovers in India are majorly governed by SEBI and under the Companies Act 2013, and the considerations emanating from the Competition Act 2002 need to be addressed. Market regulation must also be followed when the target company is taken over without consent.  \n\nCompanies often prevent hostile takeovers through various defence tactics. For example, the bid offered by the Adani Group could be countered through the buyback of shares. Section 68 of the Companies Act 2013 legalizes the buyback of shares. Similarly, the tender offer process is another defence scheme adopted by companies. It is similar to the buyback of shares, only at a price the shareholders can tender. In the case of NDTV-Adani, the open offer might have failed. Still, the tender offer process could have worked with the collaboration of all the shareholders allowing proportional buyback of the respective shares.\n\nPreventing hostile takeovers through open offers looks good in theory. However, the authorization for the same becomes tedious through the articles of association or a special resolution backed by 75% of the shareholders. Thus, in companies where more than 50% stake has been acquired, it becomes practically impossible for the target companies to regain their control. Further, the ancillary disclosure and compliance requirements envisioned in the Companies Act 2013 and the SEBI regulations make the passage of buyback of shares a far-fetched reality for companies in India. \n\nSEBI must make compliance and penalty provisions more stringent to prevent takeovers of this nature. To prevent hostile takeovers, businesses and investors must be open with all parties involved, including shareholders, customers, and workers. \nCompetition ActCompetition Commission of IndiaHostile TakeoversAdaniNDTV\nCorporate Law\n145 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Section 36 of Stamp Act: A Defense Against NN Global or a Fruitless Argument?",
        "content": "Arun Raghuram Mahapatra\nAug 25\n5 min read\nSection 36 of Stamp Act: A Defense Against NN Global or a Fruitless Argument?\n[Arun is a student at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law.]\n\nThe debate whether an arbitration clause in an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement can be enforced has been a moot question in various judicial pronouncements over the years. However, until recently, there was no settled position with regard to this point of law, as numerous High Courts (HC) and even the Supreme Court (SC) had rendered contradictory judgments on this question. Only on 25 April 2023, did a 5-judge panel of the SC in NN Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Limited (NN Global) finally settled this position of law by holding that an unstamped/insufficiently stamped agreement could not be acted upon the arbitration agreement until such defect is cured.\n\nAlthough the NN Global judgment has opened a floodgate of enforceability challenges in ongoing arbitral proceedings, it has also led to lawyers coming up with novel constructions of the Indian Stamp Act 1899 (Stamp Act) in order to bypass NN Global and act upon insufficiently stamped agreements. One such novel argument that has been raised to circumvent NN Global has been the application of Section 36 of the Stamp Act, which reads as follows:\n\n“36. Admission of instrument where not to be questioned. —Where an instrument has been admitted in evidence, such admission shall not, except as provided in section 61, be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped.”\n\nOn the basis of the said provision, it has been broadly argued that if a challenge to the admission of an unstamped/insufficiently stamped agreement is not raised at the preliminary stage and the same is admitted as evidence, then the enforceability of the arbitration agreement cannot be questioned at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\nThis article analyzes the above proposition and contends that such an argument is bad in law and should not be entertained by arbitral tribunals so as to allow the enforcement of an unstamped / insufficiently stamped arbitration agreement. In particular, it argues on the basis of the inherent difference between the concepts of admission of a document as evidence and that of acting upon / enforcement of a document.\n\nNN Global on Section 36 of Stamp Act: An Ambiguous Obiter\n\nAlthough the SC in NN Global has discussed the relevant provisions of the Stamp Act in clinical detail, it has not directly addressed the question of the effect of Section 36, vis-à-vis challenges to enforceability, on an unstamped / insufficiently stamped agreement which has been already admitted as evidence. The only reference to this proposition has been made in paragraphs 51-52 of the judgment, that too in the form of an ambiguous obiter. In light of this, it is pertinent that we analyze both from a theoretical and a precedential standpoint.\n\nBare Provisions of Stamp Act: Ordinary Meaning and Theoretical Analysis\n\nOn a bare perusal of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, it is clear that the said provision not only bars any instrument chargeable with stamp duty to be admitted as evidence for any purpose but also specifically bars the right to act upon, i.e., enforce, such an instrument. On the other hand, Section 36 of the Stamp Act deals solely with the question of the admissibility of an instrument as evidence and not with the aspect of “acting upon” or enforceability of the said instrument. Thus, although Section 36 is an exception to Section 35, it is only an exception within the purview of admissibility as evidence. Consequently, theoretically speaking, even if a document is admitted as evidence, although its admission may not be challenged, the acting upon / enforceability of the same can be agitated even at a later stage in the arbitral proceedings.\n\nPrecedential Backing: Evidence May Be Admitted but Not Acted Upon  \n\nThe above theoretical standpoint has been confirmed by the SC in Hindustan Steel Limited v. Dilip Construction Co. (Hindustan Steel), wherein the court has held in obiter that “... Section 36 does not prohibit a challenge against an instrument that it shall not be acted upon because it is not duly stamped.” However, to put the same in clearer words, reference can be made to the judgment of Karnataka HC in K Dinesh and Others v. Kumaraswamy and Others (K Dinesh), wherein this matter was decided as part of its ratio. Here, the Karnataka HC held that “... acting upon is not included in the admission and that a document can be admitted in evidence but not be acted upon.” and that “though the admissibility of the document in question […] cannot be raised as rightly held by the court below - however, the Court is precluded from acting upon it for any other purpose, unless duty and penalty are paid.” Thus, the theoretical standpoint that emerges from the bare reading of Sections 35 and 36 of the Stamp Act, has also been confirmed and upheld from a precedential standpoint in the Indian legal landscape. Resultantly, since acting upon or enforcing an insufficiently stamped instrument is absolutely barred even if the same evidence is successfully admitted, the parties in all circumstances have to necessarily clear all stamp dues and penalties before they can enforce an arbitral clause and continue with arbitration proceedings.\n\nAddressing the Conflicting Stance: Erroneous Judgement of ARG Outlier v. HT Media\n\nHowever, in spite of the above theoretical considerations and precedents, the Delhi HC in its recent judgment of ARG Outlier Media Private Limited v. HT Media Limited (ARG Outlier), has gone in the opposite direction to hold that by virtue of Section 36, no challenge can be made to an unstamped agreement containing an arbitral clause once the same has been admitted as evidence. Here, the court has relied on precedents inter alia Javer Chand and Others v. Pukhraj Surana, Shyamal Kumar Roy v. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, and Sirikonda Madhava Rao v. N. Hemalatha, to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. However, what the Delhi HC completely missed was that these precedents dealt solely with the question of admissibility of an instrument as evidence, and not with question of acting upon an unstamped instrument. Indeed, the said precedents have not referred to the aspect of acting upon even in their obiters. Thus, essentially, the Delhi HC has conflated the aspects of admissibility of evidence and enforcement, and ended up arriving at a completely erroneous standpoint. On the other hand, had the Delhi HC adequately appreciated the difference between two distinct concepts, the logical conclusion would have been that the arbitral tribunal lacks jurisdiction to conduct the arbitral proceedings and render / enforce the said awards till the time the said curable defect, i.e., insufficiency of stamp duty, is cured. It is indeed regrettable that the Delhi HC has ended up creating a bad precedent, and it is hoped that when this point of law is taken up by the SC in the future, the final decision comes in line with the Hindustan Steel and K Dinesh judgments.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innate purpose of the NN Global judgment was to adequately safeguard government revenue and uphold the lawful dues that parties to agreements must pay under the Stamp Act. If an improper construction of Section 36 of the Stamp Act, as in ARG Outlier, is allowed, it would defeat the original purpose of safeguarding government revenue on the simple technical premise that a party did not / failed to raise objections vis-à-vis the admission of evidence. Hence, in light of the foregoing theoretical and precedential considerations, arbitral tribunals and courts should not entertain such a misleading construction of Section 36 of the Stamp Act to circumvent the law laid down in NN Global. Further, it is hoped that the SC clarifies this point of law at the earliest to minimize the confusion stemming from the ARG Outlier pronouncement and prevent the same from negatively impacting ongoing arbitrations.\nNN GlobalStamp ActArbitration and ConciliationArbitration Act\nDispute Resolution\n194 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Clarity or Perplexity: Undetermined Questions in NN Global II",
        "content": "Drishti Rajain, Pallavi Mishra\nAug 24\n7 min read\nClarity or Perplexity: Undetermined Questions in NN Global II\n[Drishti and Pallavi are Advocates practicing in the Delhi High Court.]\n\nA three-judge bench of the Supreme Court (SC) referred to the question of the validity of an unstamped arbitration agreement in light of the statutory bar under Section 33 and Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899 (Stamp Act) for determination by a Constitution Bench. The position prior to adjudication of this question of law by the Constitution Bench was established in NN Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Limited and Others (NN Global I) wherein the SC set aside the judgements passed in SMS Tea Estates Private Limited v. Chandmari Tea Company  (SMS Tea Estates) and Garware Wall Ropes Limited v. Coastal Marine Construction Engineering Limited (Garware Wall Ropes) and held that since an arbitration clause forms a separate agreement, the non-stamping of the same would not render the arbitration clause void and the arbitration agreement in consideration would be enforceable and valid. \n\nIssue Before the Constitution Bench \n\nIn the referral made by a three-judge bench of the SC, the question of law sought to be adjudicated by the Constitution Bench was whether in accordance with the statutory bar provided under Section 35 of the Stamp Act applicable to instruments chargeable to stamp duty the arbitration agreement contained in such an instrument as would be rendered non-existent, unenforceable or invalid pending the payment of such stamp duty and whether a Court acting upon a petition made under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Arbitration Act) is liable to examine the validity of such an agreement prior to adjudicating upon the Section 11 petition.   \n\nMajority Judgement by the Constitution Bench \n\nThe judgement of the Constitution Bench in NN Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Limited and Others (NN Global II) was passed with a 3:2 majority. The majority observed that the findings of the SC in SMS Tea Estates and Garware Wall Ropes were correctly rendered. It was held that an instrument which is exigible to stamp duty and contains an arbitration clause which is unstamped shall not be considered to be a contract which is enforceable in law under the Contract Act 1872. The SC further held that a court acting under Section 11 of the Act is duty-bound to act under Section 33 of the Stamp Act, hence the arbitration agreement is required to be stamped prior to appointment of an arbitrator. \n\nIn its majority judgement, the SC overlooked certain considerable issues. Firstly, whether the judgement in NN Global II would be applicable retrospectively or retroactively; secondly, whether the requirement of stamping would be made applicable to the ongoing arbitrations and lastly, whether the transgression into the limited scope of interference by a Court as envisioned under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is in consonance with the scope and object therein. \n\nRetrospective or Retroactive Application of NN Global II\n\nThe terms retroactive and retrospective have often been used interchangeably but are distinct terms differentiated by subtle nuances. Retroactivity refers to the application of a statute/ judgement that applies to events that pan out post the coming into force of the said statute / judgement but in relation to an agreement that was in existence prior to the date of coming into force of such judgement. Retrospective refers to statutes/judgements which apply to events that have been completed in the past and with respect to agreements that were entered into in the past. \n\nThe SC, in its judgement in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Rajkumar Nagpal, has distinguished between the implications of retrospectivity and retroactivity and reiterated the principles elucidated in Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (Vineeta Sharma) and held that a retroactive statute is considered to be one which operates in the future, although its operation is based upon an event that arose prior in time or a requisite which had been drawn from antecedent events. Retrospectivity in terms of Vineeta Sharma was determined to be a statute that operates from the past and applies to events that have culminated in the past. \n\nIn line with the jurisprudence evolved on the definition of retrospectivity and retroactivity, the ratio of the judgement in NN Global II should ideally be applicable retroactively i.e., pertinent to agreements signed prior to the said judgement albeit submitted to arbitration subsequent to the judgement. However, in a multitude of judgements, the SC has clarified that a judicial decision is to be applied retrospectively. A judicial decision can be differentiated from a statute or legislation which takes away a vested right while a judicial decision only adjudicates upon the existing law and provides clarification regarding the same. In Asst. Commissioner v. Saurashtra Kutch Sock Exchange, while upholding the retrospective application of a judicial decision, the SC held that judges are only entrusted with the power to clarify the existing law and they do not propound new law. In light of the aforementioned observations, the correct principle of law as interpreted is to be applied retrospectively. \n\nIn the authors’ view, the application of this judgement shall be retrospective as is the case with all declarations of law since this judgement is a mere clarification on the position of law and not the formulation of a new law by the SC. \n\nRequirement of Stamping to the Ongoing Arbitrations vis-à-vis NN Global II\n\nIn addition to the above, the SC has failed to render any finding to clarify whether its judgement will be made applicable to arbitrations which are at the final stage of arguments and where reference has been made to the court for the appointment of an arbitrator. \n\nThe Arbitration Act confers upon the arbitrator under Section 16 the power to adjudicate upon its own jurisdiction. Although it is iterated in Section 16(2) that a plea under Section 16 can only be made prior to the filing of the statement of defence, the jurisprudence on the subject matter has shown that a plea under Section 16 can be made any time prior to the final arguments in the matter by amending the statement of defence as long as the substance of the pleading is not altered. \n\nThe SC, in its judgement in Revajeetu Builders and Developers v. Narayanaswamy and Sons and Others, has clarified that the courts at any stage may allow “the parties to amend their pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just and those amendments may be allowed which are imperative for determining the controversy between the parties”. \n\nAccordingly, the SC in its judgement in NN Global II has stated that an unstamped arbitration agreement is void until it is stamped thereby making the issue of stamping an imperative one to be adjudicated upon prior to the adjudication of the dispute. Therefore, in the authors’ view, the determination of the legal validity of an arbitration agreement can be made applicable to the ongoing arbitration proceedings. \n\nIn accordance with the object and purpose of the Stamp Act, if the arbitration proceedings have crossed the pre-referral stage, it becomes the duty of the arbitrator to carry out the functions of the court and ascertain that the arbitration agreement is duly stamped and is in consonance with the principles of the Stamp Act. Accordingly, owing to the retrospective application of declaration of law by a court, the SC’s ratio in NN Global II would be applicable to all ongoing arbitral proceedings. \n\nTransgression into the Limited Scope of Interference by a Court vide NN Global II\n\nThe SC has clarified that the primary object and purpose of the Stamp Act is revenue generation and accordingly, the said judgement has expanded the scope of adjudicatory power provided to a court in a petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act.\n\nThe SC, while adjudicating upon the issue of stamping of an arbitration agreement, stated that while determining the existence of an arbitration agreement in a Section 11 petition, the court is also duty bound to determine the enforceability of the arbitration agreement. If the arbitration agreement is insufficiently stamped, the court is vested with the power to impound it and ensure proper stamping. The scope of Section 11 of the Arbitration Act which has been reiterated by the SC vide a multitude of judgements such as Meenakshi Solar Power Private Limited v. Abhyudaya Green Economic Zones Private Limited and Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja is extremely narrow such that a court acting in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act has a limited scope of interference and should restrict itself to examination of the arbitration agreement and render all other issues for determination by the arbitrator. \n\nThe SC widening the scope of the adjudicating court in a petition filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act has given rise to a myriad of issues including the issue of expeditious trial of disputes under the Arbitration Act. The issue of determination of a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act of emergency arbitration also remains undetermined. Needless to say, the extension of powers granted to a court will lead to delays in the adjudication of the dispute and render the “speedy dispute resolution” process as envisaged in the object and scope of the Arbitration Act ineffective. \n\nPending clarification by the SC on the stipulated issues that have arisen post the adjudication of the dispute in NN Global II, applying the judicial precedents on the subject matter to the present arbitration proceedings would result in a substantial delay in the arbitration proceedings. The defect of an unstamped arbitration is a curable defect and the arbitration agreement can be made enforceable upon payment of the stamp duty in accordance with the provisions of Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act. Although the SC in NN Global II did not comment on the application of this judgement to petitions filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, in Arg Outlier Media Private Limited v. HT Media Limited, the Delhi High Court clarified that non-stamping of the arbitration agreement is violative of the Stamp Act and is an insufficient ground for setting aside the arbitral award thereby rendering some clarity on the application of NN Global II as a grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. \n\nConclusion\n\nTaking into consideration the various issues affecting the existing arbitration agreements and the transgression into the scope of Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, it may be prudent for the SC to issue clarifications with respect to the various matters in question which remain unanswered by the majority in NN Global II and ensure that the judgement of the SC is harmoniously interpreted in accordance with the scope and purpose of the Arbitration Act to ensure that the rights of the parties who submit to arbitration are not drastically affected and the essence of the Arbitration Act is upheld. \nNN GlobalStamp ActArbitration and ConciliationArbitration Act\nDispute Resolution\n121 views\n1 like.

        "title": "The IPR Defence Recommendation: Why is it an Absolute Necessity?",
        "content": "Suryansh Sritej Mohanty, Sanskruti Yukta Nayak\nAug 24\n6 min read\nThe IPR Defence Recommendation: Why is it an Absolute Necessity?\n[Suryansh and Sanskruti are students at National Law University Odisha and National Law University Delhi, respectively.]\n\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance (Committee) published, on 13 December 2022, its Fifty-Second Report on the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill) after consultation with various advisory bodies which included inter alia the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC) and other stakeholders. The said report propounded practices such as settlement and commitment and primarily centred around optimizing and tailoring the regulatory framework so that it falls in with the changes in business models that have emerged over the last two decades.\nThis article, however, focuses on a particular recommendation of the Committee, regarding the Bill, which is to allow parties a reasonable exercise of their intellectual property rights (IPR) as a valid defence when contesting allegations of abuse of dominance under a newly proposed provision to be included in the Competition Act 2002 (Act). First, this article questions the refusal of the Centre to accept the recommendation of the Committee. Then, through a critical analysis of the Indian scenario, coupled with a comparative analysis of foreign jurisdictions, it tries to ascertain whether such a move by the Centre will have drastic consequences on the rights of technology firms and whether it will discourage their quest to innovate in the sphere of digital markets.\n\nDeconstructing the Framework of IPR Defences in the Competition Act 2002\n\nUnder the Act, the only exemption for imposing reasonable conditions for the protection of IP rights is under Section 3 of the Act, as per which if an IPR holder stays within the framework of the IPR rights granted to them by virtue of the Copyright Act 1957, the Patents Act 1970, the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958, the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act 1999, the Designs Act 2000, and the Semi-conductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act 2000, they remain entitled to protection even after entering into an anti-competitive agreement. \n\nIn the case of K Sera Sera Digital Cinema Private Limited v. Pen India Limited, the CCI had particularly stressed upon the point that only reasonable conditions, as may be necessary for protecting IPR under various legislations provided under Section 3(5), can be imposed. As a consequence, the interplay between IPR and competition law hinges on the term 'reasonable conditions' as outlined expressly in Section 3(5). The logical corollary that follows from here is that the parties who have an IPR vested upon them under any of the legislations mentioned in Section 3(5) may impose any such reasonable conditions tailored to that particular legislation(s) only, leaving no room for any ambiguity, due to the boundaries being established by such legislations.\n\nHowever, the IPR exception is only limited to anti-competitive agreements under Section 3. When it comes to the provision regarding abuse of dominance (Section 4), a corresponding IPR exception is missing. While there are similar provisions in Section 4 such as those against denial of market access (Section 4(2)(c)), or unilateral conclusion of contracts (Section 4(2)(d)), or restriction of technical or scientific development (Section 4(2)(b)(i)), such provisions are too broadly defined for the purposes of determining any specific reasonable conditions for protecting IPR, resulting in the authorities, and the CCI in particular, exercising their discretion howsoever they may see fit to arrive at a decision. So, the pertinent question to ask here is whether there is a need for an explicit IPR defence under Section 4.\n\nThe Absence of an Explicit Defence in Section 4: The Current Stand\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the mere use of IPR will not constitute abuse of dominance by the concerned party. Anderman and Schmidt, in Chapter 2 of their book, The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and Competition Policy, note that “a legal monopoly created by a patent or other IPR is not assumed to confer market power or dominance.” This inherent bias against IPR stems from the conception that since IPR creates monopolies, it naturally would tend to create an abusive dominance in the market. In A Comparative Note on Possible Approaches on Refusals to License IP Rights by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, it was opined that such a notion is misguided and tends to hold the exclusionary exercise of companies with respect to IPR as “socially reproachable”.\n\nVarious stakeholders, who were involved in the making of the Fifty-Second Report, did not approve of such an ad-hoc approach by the CCI, due to it conferring too much discretion than is reasonable, which may result in regulatory uncertainty and potential bias against certain parties.\n\nThe Committee, which brought out the Fifty-Second Report, noted that in the absence of an explicit defence enshrined in the law, the CCI will not allow any “dominant entity to provide for reasonable protection of its IPR, while being investigated for alleged abuse of dominance”. Prior to this, even the CLRC had recommended that “this defence may be allowed in cases involving dominant position”, recommending in their report that for protecting IPR, a defence allowing reasonable conditions and restrictions may be provided in cases of abuse of dominance on the lines of international jurisdictions i.e., EU, US and UK which provide for such exemption. Further, it was discussed in the same report that a specific IPR defence should be provided under Section 4, under the umbrella of a new section to avoid any uncertainty as it is already explicitly outlined in Section 3(5)(i) of the Competition Act that deals with certain other categories of anti-competitive conduct, namely anti-competitive agreements. \n\nDrawing Insights from Global Practices: Is the Absence of an Absolute Defence Constricting Innovation?\n\nGlobally, several jurisdictions have already acknowledged the necessity to ensure specific legislation dealing with the issue of abuse of dominance and considered the reasonable exercise of IPR in such cases, which in turn can streamline the already available remedies. \n\nIn this regard, in the case of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. v. ZTE Corp., the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has noted that it is imperative that a balance be struck between maintaining free competition and safeguarding the rights of intellectual property holders, when deciding if an IPR holder has abused its dominant position or not. The ECJ, in the case of Parke, Davis & Co. v. Probel, has further noted that ownership of an intellectual property should be considered as a factor while assessing whether a firm has abused its dominant position.\n\nA similar approach, regarding the constricting of innovation in the sphere of technology, has been adopted by the courts in the United States, particularly noted in the case of Data General Corp. v. Grumman Systems Support Corp., where the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts analysed the situation regarding weak IPR defence, and how it strangles the workings of the market when viewed through a larger lens. It observed that anti-competitive acts cannot be “interpreted to require manufacturers to abandon their advantage in creating accessories to their systems. If manufacturers of complex and innovative systems were required to share with competitors the development of accessories, because they had a possibly absolute advantage through producing the system, the incentives of copyright and patent laws would be severely undermined. Not only would the manufacturer, who is in the best position to create these accessories, have less incentive to do so, but also the impetus for competitors to reverse engineer and produce competing solutions would be reduced.” \n\nAll of this boils down to the logical conclusion that innovation needs to have some amount of free rein to function efficiently in a competitive market, else the essence of intellectual property rights gets defeated when a governing body gets absolute control over deciding the fate of a party. On the other hand, when the governing body and the parties are bound by express legislations, it may help in fostering a collaborative and informed approach, where the CCI can foster a robust and effective materiality framework that balances transparency, corporate interests, and market power, while keeping the abuse of such dominance at bay.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the advisory bodies in India have displayed a remarkable vision by recommending the grant of protection to IPR holders while they are accused of abusing their dominant position, it is imperative to keep in mind the lessons that we can draw from foreign jurisdictions. In conclusion, this article has tried to analyse the situation in view of the current Indian landscape, but the jurisprudence with regard to anti-competitive practices and IPR is still at a very nascent stage. Addressing the core factors, such as constriction of innovation and unlimited discretion of the governing bodies, is extremely vital to strike the right balance between transparency at the legislative level and safeguarding the interests of the organisation at the corporate level while stabilizing market power to ensure that innovation forges ahead unimpeded.\nCompetitionCompetition ActCompetition Commission of IndiaCCIIntellectual PropertyCompetition (Amendment) Bill 2022\nCompetition Law\n•\nLaw and Policy\n101 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Analyzing the RBI FLDG Guidelines",
        "content": "Tarpan Soni, Shivi\nAug 21\n6 min read\nAnalyzing the RBI FLDG Guidelines\n[Tarpan and Shivi are students at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Punjab.]\n\nOn 8 June 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the much anticipated guidelines on first loss default guarantee (FLDG Guidelines). These guidelines have been released consequent to the digital lending guidelines released by the central bank in September last year which had in effect prohibited all kinds of FLDG arrangement between a lending service provider (LSP) / digital lending application (DLA) (used as “fintech entity(s)” interchangeably) and the regulated entities (REs). However, the new guidelines have now permitted such FLDG arrangements between fintech entities and REs, which are the banks and the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), albeit with certain conditions, restrictions and caps. This article first describes what an FLDG arrangement is and then analyzes the guidelines on FLDG arrangement released by RBI. This is followed by certain suggestions as to what should be the way forward for RBI with respect to the same and the conclusion. \n\nUnderstanding an FLDG Arrangement\n\nFLDG arrangement as defined in the FLDG Guidelines, pertains to an express agreement between the REs and LSPs in which guarantee is provided by an LSP on the outstanding amount of a particular loan portfolio specified upfront between LSP and RE. LSP, as defined in the Digital Lending Guidelines, is the agent of RE that carries out lending functions such as customer acquisition, underwriting support, price supporting and other activities on behalf of the RE and must mandatorily be incorporated as a company under the Companies Act 2013. Such lending functions of LSPs are facilitated using DLAs which are mobile based applications of either the REs or LSPs. These apps are used for extending loan facilities to the end users and are managed in pursuance to the guidelines issued by the RBI for banks and NBFCs for outsourcing their lending activities. \n\nThe following example will help in understanding the working of an FLDG agreement in a better way. Let us say X is a DLA that is owned by Y, an LSP company registered under the Companies Act 2013. X facilitates loans in partnership with Z, one of its lending partners which is an NBFC, thereby an RE. Herein, X acquires customers for Z to lend, and most of these customers are those which fail to get credit from banks owing to low credit score, lack of collateral, etc. X provides underwriting support for these customers. Since these loans are high risk loans, the NBFC, that is Z, makes an agreement with the LSP, that is Y, in which Y guarantees to compensate Z for the loss due to default of the certain percentage of the loans of Z, acquired through X.\n\nThe Need for Regulation\n\nThe abovementioned arrangement proves beneficial for all the parties involved in the transaction as NBFCs get more customers and share the interest income with the fintech entities. At the same time, this provides quick and easy access to credit for people with low credit scores as LSPs perform their underwriting. Furthermore, NBFCs are not hesitant to provide large loans as the LSPs provide guarantee of a certain percentage of the loans acquired by them for the NBFC. However, it is a two-edged sword and has its risks as well. Prior to the coming up of Digital Lending Guidelines in September 2022 there was no cap on the limit to which the guarantee could be provided by the LSPs. This led to arrangements where even 100% default guarantee was being provided by the fintech companies and the NBFCs were freely giving loans as they had virtually no risk, without conducting proper due diligence of the fintech companies. However, this was not a sound financial situation as it could lead to a large number of defaults, and the whole risk was being transferred to completely unregulated entities (LSPs) which posed huge data and systemic risks. \n\nHence, in order to crack down on these unregulated transactions and to bring the responsibility back to regulated entities, the RBI has come up with the FLDG Guidelines, keeping a cap of 5% of outstanding loan portfolio on FLDG arrangements between NBFCs and fintech entities. This comes after September last year, when RBI had in effect prohibited any kind of FLDG arrangement between fintechs and REs, thereby creating large uncertainty in the emerging fintech lending sector. \n\nDeciphering the RBI Guidelines on FLDG\n\nThe RBI, in its bid to regulate these high risk FLDG arrangements, has introduced the FLDG Guidelines. These guidelines have limited the amount of FLDG to 5% of the outstanding amount of a particular loan portfolio, specified upfront between the RE and fintech. Further, RBI has made it mandatory for the REs to categorize the defaulted loans as NPAs only even when they have been made good by its partnering fintech. Apart from that, the guarantee provided by fintech has to be in the form of  cash deposit with the RE or as fixed deposits made in the favor of RE in a scheduled commercial bank or as a bank guarantee in favor of the RE. Also, the tenor of the guarantee should not be less than the longest tenor of the longest loan in the  portfolio specified between the RE and the fintech entity and the guarantee must be invoked by the RE within 120 days of the default. \n\nSuggestions and the Way Forward\n\nThe FLDG guidelines provide a much needed relief to REs and LSPs as there was an atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding the space post the release of the Digital Lending Guidelines last year. However, the RBI should gradually moderate its approach to best reflect the needs of this nascent but high potential industry. The guidelines provide that the defaulted loans that have been made good by fintech should be categorised as non-performing assets (NPA) only. However, this could prove to be detrimental for the REs, especially the smaller NBFCs. The REs would be providing loans to the customers brought by the fintech, considering the FLDG arrangements they have with the fintech entity. Inclusion of those loans as NPAs that have been made good by the fintech entity will unnecessarily increase the NPAs on the books of the REs. For the smaller NBFCs, this will pose a problem as to the outsiders, it will create an outlook that the NBFC is not in a good financial position which might affect an NBFC’s other non lending businesses. This provision might deter the REs from entering into FLDG arrangements with the LSPs. The RBI’s rationale behind this could be that it wants to get a clear picture of all the engagements between the fintechs and the REs in this fast developing sector and to ensure that the REs have the incentive to conduct proper due diligence of the customers being brought by the fintech, which was not being done earlier. Although this may be required initially, in the early stages of this market, as the market players evolve, the RBI must not require categorization of the defaulted covered loans as NPAs.\n\nFurther, the guidelines provide that the guarantee should not exceed five percent of the loan portfolio specified upfront between the RE and the LSP. This seems a bit arbitrary considering that all the LSPs do not have the same financial position and condition. Some of the LSPs may be in a better position to provide a larger FLDG cover for the REs. For example, the revenue of fintechs such as Paytm and PhonePe was INR 4,974 crores and INR 1,797 crores respectively in the financial year (FY) 2021-22, whereas the revenue of fintechs such as Chqbook was INR 13 crores in the same FY. Keeping all the LSPs on the same pedestal, when there is a substantial differentiation among the LSPs in the Indian market, is not justified as their risk-taking abilities differ greatly. Hence, it is suggested that the RBI should create a further sub-categorisation of the default limit of these service providers on the basis of their risk taking capacity that could be calculated in accordance with their cash flow, revenue, liquidity, debt-equity ratio etc. Alternatively, RBI should strive to gradually increase the 5% cap on FLDG cover. This is also in consonance with the feedback  received from industry players by the RBI in the report of its Working Group on Digital Lending (Working Group Report) which suggested to keep the FLDG limit between 15% and 20%. This will provide the incentive to REs to lend more through these fintech entities and thereby capture the untapped borrowers in the country. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe RBI has indeed done well by allowing FLDG arrangements in India and deviating from RBI’s recommendations in the Working Group Report, which as opposed to the feedback received from industry players, had recommended a total prohibition on such arrangements. This recognition of FLDG arrangements by the RBI is also likely to increase funding for the emerging fintech players as the regulatory concerns have now been completely alleviated. However, in order to ensure that the digital lending industry keeps on making big strides in India, the RBI should gradually move towards a slightly soft touch approach giving flexibility to the fintech players. This will also accelerate the growth of credit availability to the margins of the country where, till now, the informal sources charging extremely high interest rates have been prevalent. \nFLDGFintechRBINBFCDigital Lending\nCorporate Law\n220 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Protecting India’s Financial Landscape: Time for a Framework for DSIIs?",
        "content": "Satwik Mohapatra\nAug 21\n6 min read\nProtecting India’s Financial Landscape: Time for a Framework for DSIIs?\n[Satwik is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nIn 2010, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommended the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to identify insurers that were “too big to fail” and  whose failure would result in massive disruption of the economy. Thereafter, insurers like American International Group, Allianz SE, and some other insurers were categorized as Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs) by the IAIS. The categorization was done based on their size, interconnectedness, and Non-Traditional Insurance and Non-Insurance (NTNI) activities, which include leverage and liquidity transformations and Credit Default Swaps. \n\nThe idea behind GSIIs is to identify insurers that are susceptible to systemic risks and to mitigate any risks and distress involved in the event of their failure. For this, the IAIS has put in place a Holistic Framework for Systemic Risks in the Insurance Sector. Additionally, IAIS recommended all the member countries lay down regulatory further frameworks for Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs). The classification of D-SIIs was to be done based on their size, interconnectedness, importance, and numerous other factors. \n\nThe Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has recently designated three insurance institutions as D-SIIs. However, there is a lack of a framework to regulate and identify the D-SIIs in India. The author discusses several approaches taken by IAIS and IRDAI, argues in favour of the need to have a regulatory framework for D-SIIs and further suggests reforms.\n\nApproach Taken by IAIS for Identification of G-SIIs\n\nThe IAIS first introduced policy measures for G-SIIs in 2013. These measures laid out individual indicators, some of which included size, connectedness, NTNI activities, and substitutability. The assessment methodology employed by IAIS was to assess the insurer institutions on each indicator and reach a final score. These measures also included supervision, resolvability, loss absorption mechanisms, and liquidity planning. However, these measures were revised in 2016. This revision was done to increase the transparency of the process and further maintain uniformity of evaluation among insurers. \n\nThe revised measures focused on qualitative and quantitative assessments of insurers, as each differed from the other in terms of size, structure, and risk exposure. Furthermore, the 2016 policy measures revised the existing indicators. Moreover, the revised measures introduced various phases of the assessment process, which involved data collection annually, quality control, and the collection of additional data for assessment. However, this measure was discontinued in 2019, and IAIS introduced a holistic framework for assessing G-SIIs. \n\nThe introduction of the framework was done because of the changed approach of IAIS in examining and mitigating the risks associated with insurers. The policy measures were based on the theory that systemic risks will arise not only from individual insurers but also from the disruptions faced by the insurers collectively at a sector-wide level. \n\nThe new holistic approach of IAIS included advancements vis-à-vis supervision and monitoring exercises. This framework allows enhanced supervision of insurance institutions and intervention policies utilizing the Insurance Core Principles and Common Frame for insurance institutions that are active internationally. These are supervisory materials that further enhance the supervision of insurers, regardless of the jurisdiction and level of sophistication involved in the insurance market. Moreover, the holistic framework can be tapered to fit the needs of a particular jurisdiction to align with the legal structure and the financial markets.\n\nMeasures Undertaken by IRDAI\n\nAs of March 2023, IRDAI has designated three insurance institutions as D-SIIs, namely, Life Insurance Corporation of India, General Insurance Corporation of India, and New India Assurance  Company. This decision was taken owing to interconnectedness, size, and complexity of the insurers. Furthermore, IRDA stated that these insurers have to raise their level of corporate governance, flag risks, and execute sound risk management. Additionally, IRDAI stated in a circular that D-SIIs have to submit a peer-reviewed report and carry out asset liability management and stress testing as part of the information needed for annual actuarial valuation. \n\nThe IRDAI constituted a 6-member committee in 2019 to establish a supervisory regulatory framework. However, there has been no structured framework for the identification and regulation of D-SIIs in India till now.\n\nCause for Concern\n\nIndia needs a regulatory framework to counter the various challenges it faces, like inadequate capital, lack of regulation and supervision, maintaining solvency margin, etc. There is a need for substantial supervision, enhanced monitoring, and a proper timeline for implementation. While designating D-SIIs there needs to be an in-depth analysis and thorough collection of data. Additionally, there is a need for separate assessment techniques for life insurance and general insurers owing to the differences between their coverage, duration, etc. \n\nMoreover, the assessment should be done not only based on indicators like size, complexity, interconnectedness, and market importance, as has been done by IRDAI, but also basis new indicators such as emerging risk trends, behaviour of policyholders, underwriting, and solvency. This will further result in a comprehensive collection of data and assist in identification of D-SIIs. Moreover, these indicators are in line with the holistic framework introduced by IAIS. Furthermore, the IRDAI circular designating D-SIIs states that the D-SIIs will have enhanced supervision. However, there is a lack of clarity on exactly what these enhanced supervisions are. \n\nThe D-SIIs are considered “too big to fail.” This notion fuels the impression that these insurers will have government backing during times of distress. This is also known as capital injection. However, this very expectation gives rise to numerous risks, such as a reduction in market discipline and competitive distortion. These further substantiate the need for a framework to regulate the identification and functioning of D-SIIs to deal with systemic risk or moral hazard issues. Additionally, this was also one of the reasons why the Reserve Bank of India put in place a framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs). \n\nThe rising interconnectedness of the insurers and their links to other important financial institutions is another cause for concern. In the event of the failure of one insurer, the functioning of several insurers will be affected. Additionally, the failure of an insurer would have wide ramifications if certain critical services performed by it cannot be substituted by another insurer. \n\nThe complexity of the insuring institutions further warrants a well-established framework. The higher the complexity, the more time and resources are consumed to resolve the issue. Having a framework can help establish a proper set of procedures to be followed in the event of such problems. \n\nFurthermore, the International Monetary Fund has stated in its report that India faces issues with respect to a risk-based framework. This is a cause for concern, as a lack of a risk-based framework hinders the proper assessment of risks. Additionally, the implementation of a proper risk assessment framework will further complement risk management. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on all sectors. This impact was felt in the insurance sector as it raised both short and long-term challenges. From operational challenges to dips in revenue and depleting reserves, insurers had to attend to various concerns such as business continuity, crisis management, capital adequacy, etc. To counter these unprecedented impacts, there needs to be a framework or a plan that ensures the proper functioning of insurers, especially D-SIIs, which are “too big to fail.”\n\nSuggested Reforms\n\nThere needs to be a regulatory framework in place that incorporates indicators that assess risks that arise not only from individual insurers but also from all insurers collectively. Additionally, there should be proper data collection at multiple levels and an adequate observation period before any decisions are made. \n\nMoreover, a Systemic Risk Management Plan (SRM) should be in place. The SRM plan will specifically address the assessment, mitigation, and neutralization of the risks. Furthermore, such a plan should set out all measures in a structured manner, like higher loss absorption and improved resolutions. Better and more effective resolutions guarantee that there are no major disruptions and ensure the absorption of losses by creditors in the event of liquidation. A well-established resolution avoids the waste of time and resources. \n\nCurrently, Financial Service Providers (FSP) do not fall under the ambit of the insolvency regime in India, i.e., the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (the Code). However, the Central Government can notify certain FSPs, in consultation with their regulatory authority, to be resolved under the Code. Alternatively, there can be a separate insolvency mechanism for insurers and other FSPs instead of resolving them under the general insolvency law. In both scenarios, the intent will be to have the best possible resolution for insurers. However, the technicalities might differ. \n\nIndia can follow the footsteps of Singapore while designing a framework for D-SIIs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has recently released a consultation paper that lays down the guidelines for D-SIIs. The proposed framework is in accordance with the IAIS recommendations. Additionally, MAS has also proposed a two-year observation period wherein they will collect the data of the insurers before designating them as D-SIIs. This provides adequate time for decision-making. \n\nIt is pertinent to note that Singapore has a specific framework for financial institutions and the banking sector that helps them identify D-SIBs. MAS has aligned the proposed framework for D-SIIs with the already existing framework for D-SIBs wherever needed. The IRDAI can follow the approach taken by the MAS and structure the D-SII framework around the existing framework of D-SIBs, which are in line with the Basel Committee recommendations, appropriately. Moreover, framework should be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are up to global standards and take into consideration sector-wide development. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe closeness of insurance institutions to banks and the real economy warrants intensive supervision of these institutions, which would further strengthen the financial infrastructure of the country. Implementation of a proper framework will assist in comparability and decrease disparity among insurers in different jurisdictions. Additionally, with the addition of regulatory measures, the insurers and the regulatory authorities will be better prepared to handle any unprecedented risk that might arise and further prevent any disorderly failure and its impact on the real economy. \nFinancial Stability BoardInternational Association of Insurance SupervisorsGlobal Systemically Important InsurersIRDAI\nCorporate Law\n60 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Unveiling the Online Gaming Commission: Examining its Role and Impact on State Jurisdiction",
        "content": "Mishika Bedi\nAug 19\n6 min read\nUnveiling the Online Gaming Commission: Examining its Role and Impact on State Jurisdiction\n[Mishika is a student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.]\n\nThe traces of India’s association with the gaming industry can be found as early as 3000 BCE. With the advent of the internet, the nature of games expanded to the online mode via the medium of PC Gaming and Console. The number of online gamers in India is increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 12%, projected to reach 700 million by 2025. Within just 5 years, the number of Indian gaming companies has increased to 900 million, and the gaming market size is expected to grow by 27% by 2027. This rise of the gaming industry has prompted the government to regulate the gaming industry through some of its recently introduced legislations. In this article, the author analyses the Online Gaming Commission (Commission) proposed to be set up under the Online Gaming (Regulation) Bill 2022 (Bill) vis-à-vis self-regulatory bodies proposed under the draft amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 (IT Rules). Additionally, the article explores the implications of the Commission on existing state laws.\n\nOnline Gaming (Regulation) Bill 2022\n\nThe Bill was introduced last year in order to regulate the online gaming sector in India. Broadly, the Bill proposes the setting up of a Commission under Section 3 with the aim of having an oversight over the functioning of online gaming websites. The Commission has been given the power to grant licenses to online gaming websites without which no person will be permitted to operate such a website. \n\nAdditionally, on 2 January 2023, the draft amendments to the IT Rules (draft IT Rules) have also been introduced which can be seen as a milestone step by the Government of India in recognizing the online gaming industry. Alongside the Commission that has been set up under the Bill, these draft IT Rules propose for the setting up of self-regulatory bodies. The next section aims to draw a parallel between both these bodies. \n\nDichotomy between Commission and Self-Regulatory Bodies\n\nWhile the Bill proposes to set up a Commission, the draft IT Rules proposes to set up self-regulatory bodies which will be responsible for ‘registering’ or ‘granting membership’ to an online gaming intermediary. Following is a comparison between the two bodies proposed. \n\nComposition\n\nThe composition of the Commission has been laid down as comprising a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and 5 members nominated by the Central Government.\n\nThe composition of a self-regulatory body is one person each from the following fields / individuals viz. (a) online gaming, sports, or entertainment, (b) online game players, (c) psychology, medicine, or consumer education, (d) public policy, public administration, law enforcement or public finance (nominated by the Central Government), and (e) information communication technology.\n\nFunction\n\nThe function of the Commission is to grant licenses to online gaming websites without which no person will be permitted to operate an online gaming website.  \n\nThe function of a self-regulatory body is to grant registration / membership to online gaming intermediaries without which no person will be permitted to operate their online games.\n\nIt can be inferred that the draft IT Rules are not in harmony with the already proposed Bill. A closer look at the composition helps us decipher the spirit and intent of the legislature while proposing the above mentioned legislations. Through the Commission, the Central Government intends to control the gaming industry by nominating members, whereas, through the self-regulatory bodies, it intends to enable self-governance of the industry. \n\nThe biggest question is that if both the Bill and the draft IT Rules get passed, how these two bodies are going to co-exist. The function of both these bodies seems to be identical, i.e., while the Commission has the function of granting licenses to online gaming websites, the self-regulatory bodies grant memberships in disguise of licensing. Both these bodies will inevitably engage in redundant duplication of functions, operating under distinct frameworks that will ultimately lead to confusion. For instance, in a scenario where a gaming website obtains a license from the Commission but fails to secure registration from a self-regulatory body or vice versa, the question arises as to whether the website is permitted to offer the game on a public platform. Therefore, in order to prevent confusion and more ambiguity in a fledgling industry, there is an urgent need to harmonize these two legislative developments before any of these come into force.\n\nThe Impact on State Laws\n\nGame of skill v/s game of chance\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of India, skill-based games are regulated by the Centre under Entries 31, 42 and 97 of List I, while chance-based games listed as ‘betting and gambling’ under Entry 34 of List II are state subjects. The distinction between what is a game of skill and what is a game chance is still sub judice before the Supreme Court. The lack of a clear differentiation has resulted in certain states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana enacting laws that enforce a blanket ban on all forms of online gaming, arguing that every game involves an element of chance and hence falls under state jurisdiction. Such legislation unequivocally violates the right to engage in any profession, occupation, trade, or business. Therefore, it is imperative for the Central Government to establish regulations for online gaming as it is fundamentally a business activity and should consequently be protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\n\nAnalyzing the powers of the Commission\n\nIt is important to note that the Commission established under the Bill does not have the power to make rules or regulations, i.e., it does not have any legislative powers. It merely has regulatory powers. This raises an important question: if a Central law establishes a body with solely 'regulatory' powers, will it supersede state laws? It is abundantly clear from the language of Article 254 of the Constitution that “if any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament, the law made by Parliament, shall prevail.” Given that the Commission cannot come up with any rules or regulations which will be deemed to be ‘law’, the question is whether the decisions, standards or guidelines set by the Commission will be binding on the states. Under the Indian jurisprudence, even delegated legislations prevailing over state law are scrutinised and doubts over their legality are expressed among scholars. The Commission, on the other hand, is merely a regulatory body that the centre has delegated its functions to and therefore, the Commission introducing any rules or regulations which can be considered as ‘provision of law’ is outside the mandate of the parent statute. Hence, any repugnancy in state laws is slightly unlikely to be addressed. \n\nHowever, it is important to understand the intent and spirit of the legislation. The intention of the legislature is to regulate all skill-based games to ensure that the right to carry on a business activity under Article 19(1)(g) is protected. If a Central law is specifically enacted in respect of online gaming, it is aiming to regulate everything that is skill-based, which comes within the ambit of the Union List so that it can address the major policy concerns. If the decisions of the Commission do not ultimately prevail over the state law, the purpose of enacting a Central Law gets defeated. \n\nA significant concern arises from the fact that the Bill lacks specific standards or definitions. Instead, it grants the Commission unfettered and unrestricted powers to come out with standards of allowing or disallowing games to operate in India. Had the Bill been comprehensive and included criteria for certifying or registering skill-based games, it could have potentially addressed conflicts between the Central and the state governments through the doctrine of repugnancy under Article 254. However, since the Bill lacks such provisions, it is improbable that the conflicts between the Central and the state governments will be effectively resolved.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, although the introduction of a Central legislation governing online gaming is a positive step, the current Bill exhibits several shortcomings that hinder its implementation. To address these issues, the following suggestions are proposed:\n\nThe Bill should be more comprehensive, incorporating specific parameters for the functioning of the Commission. This approach would help resolve conflicts between the central and the state governments.\nConsidering that a Central legislation regarding online gaming is unfamiliar to the public, it is advisable to issue guidelines or clarifications in the form of FAQs. This would provide clarity on the scope and intended regulation of the statute.\nIt is crucial for the legislation to define the terms ‘skill-based gaming’ and ‘chance-based gaming’ expressly. Clear definitions would bring clarity and avoid ambiguity in the interpretation and implementation of the law.\nThe presence of both the Commission and the self-regulatory bodies seems redundant. Therefore, it is necessary to address this redundancy and streamline the roles and responsibilities of these bodies.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the proposed legislation can be strengthened and made more effective in regulating online gaming.\nOnline GamingSelf-Regulatory BodiesInformation TechnologyIntermediary GuidelinesDigital Media Ethics\nCommercial Law\n73 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Consent Terms under IBC and Revival of CIRP on its Breach",
        "content": "Nakshatra Gujrati\nAug 18\n5 min read\nConsent Terms under IBC and Revival of CIRP on its Breach\n[Nakshatra Gujrati is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nCivil cases often strain the resources of the involved parties, prompting them to seek resolution through compromise. In such cases, parties reach agreements known as \"consent terms,\" which serve as written acknowledgments of liability and include undertakings to fulfil their respective responsibilities. In the context of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC or Code), consent terms have emerged as a recent development. The IBC aims to resolve corporate insolvency within a specified timeframe through a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). While the Code allows 270 days for resolution, extensions of up to 330 days are commonly granted, and some cases even take 400 days to complete. Given the challenges in adhering strictly to these timelines, corporate debtors and financial creditors have found a workaround. \n\nIn cases of default, the financial creditor initiates CIRP by approaching the adjudicating authority. However, there are instances where the corporate debtor requests the financial creditor to withdraw the application and instead enter into a settlement regarding the debt amount. This settlement is formalized through \"consent terms,\" which involve reciprocal promises between the corporate debtor and the financial creditor. An application for initiation of CIRP filed by the creditor can be withdrawn before or after admission by the adjudicating authority. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Rules 2016 provide provisions for restoring and reviving disposed-off applications. \n\nThe article addresses the situation where a settlement is reached, the application for CIRP is withdrawn by the creditor, and there is a risk of the debtor defaulting on payment. The article explores whether the creditor loses the right to take action against the debtor after signing a consent term and whether a CIRP application that was filed and subsequently withdrawn due to a consent term can be revived.\n\nThe Early Problems in Recognition of Consent Terms under IBC\n\nThe IBC does not prohibit consent terms, although it lacks specific provisions regarding them. The only supporting provisions can be found in Rules 48 and 49 of the NCLT Rules 2016. Rule 48 permits restoration of an application dismissed for default or decided on merits in the absence of the applicant; and, Rule 49 permits restoration of an application decided ex parte. The provisions relating to consent terms are to be found in the Civil Procedure Code 1908 (CPC). Order XXIII, Rules 1 and 3A deal with recording of compromise and withdrawal of suits. Under Rule 1(3), a fresh suit can only be instituted on the same cause of action if there is a formal defect in plaint but does not allow re-institution of withdrawn suits out of compromise. The only case fit for re-institution of such suits is provided under Rule 3A of Order XXIII which allows re-institution in case of compromise attained by fraud or misrepresentation. \n\nIf the rule of compromise from the CPC is applied to the IBC, then in the event that a consent term is signed by the corporate debtor and the creditor and the corporate debtor later defaults, the creditor would lose its recourse against the debtor under the IBC. This means that neither a fresh application can be filed nor can the original application be revived. \n\nThe NCLT in the case of AVANT Garde Private Limited v. HLL Bio Tech Privae Limited did not allow restoration of application in event of breach of consent terms following the compromise rule imported from CPC. The NCLT went on to rule that breach of consent term does not tantamount to default which is a requirement under Section 7 or Section 9 of the IBC to file an application for CIRP. However, this reasoning is flawed as the liability of the corporate debtor towards the creditor still exists. In the case of Sesh Nath Singh v. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Co-operative Bank Limited, the Supreme Court held that “consent terms serve as a formal acknowledgment of liability”. Thus, the rule of compromise from CPC is a bad rule if applied in cases of IBC.\n\nThe Departure from Compromise Rule and the Need for Revival of CIRP Application\n\nEarlier in this article, it is established that the process of CIRP which ought to be timebound faces challenge to adhere to strict timelines. In an event of default, if the corporate debtor and the creditor are allowed to enter into a settlement, it will be in furtherance of the foremost principle of IBC, i.e. resolution of entity without going into liquidation. Thus, it becomes very crucial to recognise the right of a creditor to proceed against corporate debtor in event of breach of consent terms. \n\nRecently, in the case of Priyal Kantilal Patel v. IREP Credit Capital Private Limited (Priyal), the appellants went against the order of NCLT that had allowed revival of CIRP application on breach of consent terms. The appellants argued that the breach of consent terms does not amount to financial debt and thus the creditor has no right to file a petition for revival of CIRP. They relied on the ruling of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in Amit Kumar Agrawal v. Tempo Appliances Private Limited, that stated “merely breaching the terms of any agreement, including a settlement agreement by a party whereby some payment was due, would not fall within the scope of section 5(8) of IBC, so as to constitute a ‘financial debt’.” \n\nThe NCLAT rejected the ruling and observed that “once the parties have arrived at a consent term it would not mean that the liability of corporate debtor has been wiped out. In case of breach of consent terms, the creditor is allowed to revive the application of CIRP and not allowing it by the adjudicating authorities would mean a loophole for corporate debtors to escape their liability”. Further, in IDBI Trusteeship Limited v. Nirmal Lifestyle Limited (IDBI), NCLAT rejected the contention of corporate debtor that breach of consent terms cannot lead to revival of original CIRP application.\n\nIn the cases of Ahluwalia Contracts (India) Limited v. Logix Infratech Private Limited, Nidhi Rekhan v. Samyak Projects Private Limited, AVANT Garde Private Limited v. HLL Bio Tech Private Limited, the respective NCLTs have held that “a debt obligation arising out of a settlement agreement cannot be attributed as a financial debt”. Curiously, a debt that was financial in nature remained no longer the same after arriving at a consent term. This position was flawed legally and rendered the creditors powerless in case of breach of consent terms by the corporate debtor. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe recognition of consent terms under the IBC, as seen in the Priyal case and the IDBI case, represents a significant development in the Indian insolvency regime. These cases have established that consent terms between the corporate debtor and the creditor have legal validity and can serve as a basis for resolving the debt-related issues. In light of this development, it is essential for adjudicating authorities to consider allowing of revival of applications for CIRP in cases where the corporate debtor breaches the consent terms. \n\nBy permitting the revival of CIRP applications, the adjudicating authorities can ensure that the rights of the creditor are protected. This approach also reduces the burden on the authorities by encouraging parties to resolve their disputes through settlements, rather than resorting to lengthy and costly insolvency proceedings. Clear and unequivocal recognition of the creditor's right to revive the CIRP application in case of a breach of consent terms will act as an important safeguard to discourage corporate debtors from disregarding their obligations.\nIBCConsent TermsCorporate Insolvency Resolution ProcessNCLATNCLT\nInsolvency Law\n203 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Pedestalizing Intention - A Vivid Interpretation of the Insider Trading Regulations",
        "content": "Mayank Jain, Rohan Sood\nAug 17\n6 min read\nPedestalizing Intention - A Vivid Interpretation of the Insider Trading Regulations\n[Mayank and Rohan are students at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came up with the SEBI Prohibition on Insider Trading Regulations 2015 (SEBI Regulations 2015) to protect free and fair market competition. Resultantly, penalties were imposed upon individuals for not just trading based on unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) but also for communicating such information. UPSI is regarded as any information which can materially affect the price of the securities of a company. Regulation 4 of the SEBI Regulations 2015 clearly highlights that no person shall trade in securities when they are in possession of UPSI. To understand the legislative intent behind the relevant regulation, it becomes imperative to read the same with the explanation added to the Regulation in 2018. It stipulates that when an individual who has UPSI, trades based on such confidential information, there is a presumption that such action was based on the fact that such individual had knowledge and awareness of being in possession of UPSI. This simply means that while importing the explanation to Regulation 4, the legislative intent was to eliminate ‘intention’ as a criterion for holding someone liable for insider trading. All that was required to prove to trigger Regulation 4 was (i) trade, and (ii) trade while in possession of UPSI.\n\nRegulation 4 was drafted with the vision to protect the information asymmetry that is caused when someone happens to have UPSI. Consequently, it can be argued that Regulation 4 is itself based on the principle of parity of information. This essentially means that because the person in possession of UPSI is on a pedestal, the level of compliance for such an individual is also higher. Resultantly, the acquirer’s intention becomes irrelevant, and it does not matter if the transaction benefits the company or its shareholders. However, the judicial pronouncements have concluded to the contrary. While discussing the scope of Regulation 4, courts have gone ahead and devised 'intention’ as a prerequisite for prosecuting someone under the provision. Through this article, the authors argue that the Indian judiciary has gone ahead and unreasonably diluted the legislative intent in the name of judicial interpretation. \n\nYardstick for Interpretation \n\nTo realise whether the judiciary has correctly interpreted Regulation 4 in its various dicta, it is imperative to purport the rules of statutory interpretation to Regulation 4. In Grundy v. Pinneger [(1852) 21 LJ Ch 405] Lord Caranworth, it was noted that the literal rule of statutory interpretation is the cardinal rule, and any deviation from it would be unfathomable, i.e., impossible to rectify. The apex court in Municipal Board, Pushkar v. State Transport Authority, Rajasthan held that the court must interpret a regulation as it is, in its grammatical form even if the conclusion is a harsh one. Thus, any argument stemming from the fact that Regulation 4 would disproportionately punish individuals who lacked motive would hold no ground in front of this ruling of the Supreme Court. Surprisingly, what the Indian courts have done is that they have imputed the mischief rule of interpretation while assessing the scope of Regulation 4 and subsequently widened it more than what the legislature envisioned.\n\nTo understand the real positionality and intent behind Regulation 4 and especially the explanation that was added vis-à-vis the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (2018 Amendment), a reference must be drawn to the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 (SEBI Regulations 1992). Regulation 3(i) and 3A are pari materia to Regulation 4 of the SEBI Regulations 2015. The provisions of the SEBI Regulations 1992 did not explicitly provide for any presumption against an insider for trading with/without knowledge of UPSI. Therefore, this ambiguity and vagueness in terms of the provision allowed the court to use its understanding and interpretation by applying the mischief rule. This means that the court identified that there is a certain gap and uncertainty in the language of the law and to remedy it, they imputed their interpretation and endeavored to make the law more conclusive. \n\nThe Conflicting Judicial Dicta \n\nIn Rakesh Agarwal v. SEBI, it was noted by SEBI via a literal textual interpretation of Regulation 3 of the SEBI Regulations 1992 that mens rea does not have to be taken into consideration to prove insider trading. This essentially meant that SEBI construed the silence of the provision on the requirement of mens rea as the legislative intent behind not making ‘intention’ a prerequisite for triggering Regulation 3 of the SEBI Regulations 1992. However, on an appeal made to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), the Tribunal surprisingly took a different approach and observed that “it is true that the regulation does not specifically bring in mens rea as an ingredient of insider trading. But that does not mean that the motive need be ignored”. SAT while adjudicating the appeal observed that the legislative intent of Regulation 3 was to prohibit persons with UPSI to deal in securities to make secret profits. Therefore, an interpretation that ignores mens rea as an important ingredient to constitute insider trading will be a wrong interpretation of impugned Regulation. Further, SAT observed that under Section 15G of the SEBI Act 1992, a monetary penalty be imposed in a case of commission of insider trading.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court in The Chairman, SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund, reaffirmed the conclusion of SEBI noted in Rakesh Agarwal v. SEBI that mens rea was irrelevant to constitute insider trading but developed a separate rationale to arrive at this conclusion. The Court observed that Sections 15A to 15HB of the SEBI Act 1992 provide for only monetary penalties, which means the wrongs the above-mentioned provisions dealt with are civil wrongs. Contrarily, mens rea is a precondition in cases involving a criminal wrong and not a civil wrong. This means that the requirement of proving mens rea as a necessary element to seek remedy under Section 15G does not arise as the same deals with the regulation of penalty for insider trading which is of a civil nature. The court further held that “unless the language of the statute indicates the need to establish the presence of mens rea, it is wholly unnecessary to ascertain whether such a violation was intentional or not”.\n\nResultantly, it is submitted that the judicial position and understanding of Regulation 3 of the SEBI Regulations 1992 is amply clear. However, such scope of interpretation that was provided in the SEBI Regulations 1992 by it being silent on the aspect of ‘intention’ completely ceased to exist with its replacement by the SEBI Regulations 2015. Regulation 4 of the SEBI Regulations 2015 is devoid of all ambiguities related to the requirement of ‘intention’ via the 2018 Amendment that added the explanation to the relevant regulation. Thus, if courts hold the criterion of ‘knowledge’ or ‘intention’ mandatory, then that would unnecessarily lead to the creation of a third prong that would be antithetical to the objective of Regulation 4 of the SEBI Regulations 2015.\n\nSurprisingly, even after the addition of the explanation to Regulation 4, courts are still imputing their interpretation to understand the ambit of the provision. In Balram Garg v. SEBI, the Supreme Court discussed the importance of proving intent to constitute insider trading. In this case, SEBI held that three persons were guilty of insider trading by relying only on circumstantial evidence. The Supreme Court set aside the decision of SEBI stating that circumstantial evidence cannot be the sole factor to charge people. The court reiterated the importance of proving intent to determine insider trading or else any person with the possibility of being a connected person would be held liable for insider trading based on circumstantial evidence. \n\nMore recently, in SEBI v. Abhijit Rajan, it was noted by the Supreme Court that the accused were not guilty of insider trading because they did not have any intention of making profits with the help of the UPSI in their possession. The court further went ahead to observe that “the actual gain or loss is immaterial, but the motive for making a gain is essential”. However, it is submitted that a very large assumption is taken by the court without taking into consideration the relevant material facts. The reason a higher threshold of care is expected out of a connected person is due to their access to such UPSI and their ability to manipulate trading accordingly. The access to UPSI puts insiders in an advantageous position in comparison to an ordinary individual by allowing them to control market forces and disrupt fair market practices. For the same reason, Regulation 5 of the SEBI Regulations 2015 requires such insiders to submit an elaborate trading plan that allows the regulatory bodies to constantly monitor the actions of such connected persons. \nConclusion \n\nIt is contended that the judicial decisions have led to the shifting of the onus of proof. It is now on the prosecuting agency to prove that the accused has the requisite intention to indulge in insider trading. Earlier, owing to the seriousness of the offence, the legislature has categorically put the burden on the accused themselves to prove their innocence and resultantly, created a de facto presumption against such an accused. The dichotomy perpetuated by the courts has created a hard barrier for the SEBI Regulations 2015 to achieve their objective. It is submitted that the requirement of intention can be regarded as an exception that must be fulfilled in certain cases, but making it a blanket rule would directly strike at legislative intent and allow courts to assume a significant amount of authority.\nSEBIUPSIInsider TradingPIT Regulations\nCorporate Law\n137 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Clarificatory Amendments: Re-evaluating the Narrative",
        "content": "Tanvi Chhabra, Gayatri Kondapalli\nAug 16\n6 min read\nClarificatory Amendments: Re-evaluating the Narrative\n[Tanvi and Gayatri are students at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nA clarificatory amendment declares the law by resolving any ambiguities in an existing statute. Since it merely clarifies the legislation, such an amendment is applied retrospectively from the date of enforcement of the parent statute. However, despite such amendments not actually changing the existing law, they are subjected to criticism due to their association with retrospectivity. This is because retrospective application raises concerns like divesting of rights or unfairness. The Supreme Court, in its recent decision of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit v. Dr Manu  (Sree Sankaracharya), too, has resonated with this view.\n\nThe authors of this article have argued that clarificatory amendments do not deserve the sharp criticism that they receive. After briefly describing what clarificatory amendments are, this article engages with the reasons for the negative judicial trend. The article concludes that despite such negative treatment, clarificatory amendments are a necessary evil.\n\nAt the outset, the legal framework for the retrospective application of laws in India needs to be outlined. The Indian Constitution expressly prohibits the retrospective application of criminal statutes. On the other hand, the legislature's power to enact retrospective laws for civil matters is well recognised. In Rai Ramakrishna v. Bihar, a 5-judge bench of the Supreme Court explained that the fact of retrospectivity would not, by itself, render a legislation unconstitutional under the Constitution. While it was an important factor to be considered to render a statute invalid, unreasonability needed to be shown otherwise. It is upon the affected party to prove that the application of the Act is so unreasonable that it would contravene the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. This is a settled position of law upheld in multiple cases. One set of such retrospective legislations is clarificatory amendments. Thus, while retrospective application of clarificatory amendments has negative connotations attached, the legislature’s power to enact them is well recognised.\n\nUnderstanding Clarificatory Amendments\n\nClarificatory amendments declare the meaning of the law already in place. Such regulations aim to resolve ambiguities in the existing statute by providing a definitive meaning. Unlike regular amendments, they do not substantively change the law; they merely clarify it. There usually exists a presumption of prospective application of statutes dealing with substantive rights (as opposed to merely procedural). However, clarificatory amendments are treated differently. Since they merely clarify or reinstate the existing law, they are given effect from the date of operation of the parent statute. This has been the trend across common law countries. For instance, Australia also recognises clarificatory amendments. This is evident from the amendments to the Australian Education Act 2013. Ambiguities in this statute had led to errors in calculation of funding entitlements for authorities. In pursuance of this, an amendment was introduced a year later to correct such errors that had become apparent since the introduction of the statute. This amendment was considered clarificatory and hence was applied retrospectively.\n\nIn India as well, retrospective application of clarificatory amendments has been upheld by the courts. The following cases are instances of when the amendments neither divested rights nor imposed new duties on the public. Rather, they solely resolved underlying ambiguities for a uniform application of the parent statute. In Zile Singh v. State of Haryana, an amendment to a statute 12 years after its enactment was upheld as clarificatory by the Supreme Court. This amendment had solely removed ambiguity and furthered the intention of the legislature behind the parent statute, which could not have been done by the general reading of the statute prior to the amendment. Further, in CIT v. Poddar Cement (Poddar), an amendment was held to be clarificatory by the apex court because it clarified an omission in a section of its parent statute. Adding on, in Government of India and Others v. India Tobacco Association, an amending notification for a central government scheme was applied retrospectively by the Supreme Court. This is because the notification neither enforced any penal consequences nor produced any substantive changes; it had only clarified an obvious mistake. \n\nNavigating Through the Negative Connotations Attached to Clarificatory Amendments\n\nIf clarificatory amendments merely reinstate the existing law, their retrospective application should not be a cause for concern. However, the situation is far from ideal because the legislature often makes substantive changes to the law in the guise of a clarificatory amendment. This would grant the legislation an easy pass to retrospective application compared to terming it as a new law altogether. Substantial jurisprudence exists on this phenomenon in common law countries of Australia and United Kingdom. In the case of Hawkesbury City Council v. Sammut [ [2002] NSWCA 18], the Australian Court of Appeal held that rather than the phrases used in the legislation, the effect the legislation would create was to be given more importance. So, despite the legislature declaring it retrospective, the court could hold it otherwise based on its substance. As far as the position of the United Kingdom is concerned, the House of Lords has held that an amendment would be given retrospective effect only when it either explains its parent legislation or clarifies an obvious omission in it (reference L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. [(1994) 1 AC 486 : (1994) 2 WLR 39 : (1994) 1 All ER 20 (HL)].\n\nLikewise, in India, the legislature conveniently enacts amendments that substantively modify the existing law by terming them as clarificatory. The rising number of such legislations has led to the judiciary taking a more cautionary approach. The Supreme Court, in CIT v. Alom Extructions, has held that the benefits once granted to the public should not be taken away through a retrospective amendment and that a duty must not be created retroactively. It was further held in this case that a law could be held as non-clarificatory by the judiciary irrespective of the use of phrases such as \"it is declared\" or \"for the removal of doubts\" by the legislature; the courts would instead have to look at the substance of the statute to verify that it is not making a substantive change to the law. As per the authoritative text of G P Singh in his treatise on the Principles of Statutory Interpretation, a change in substance is not reflected when the meaning of the amended provision is the same as that of the un-amended provision. In Poddar, it was further held that such a change is also not reflected when the amendment is clarifying a provision that had been subject to diverse interpretations by the court. Additionally, in the case of Keshavlal Jethalal Shah v. Mohanlal Bhagwandas, the apex court did not consider the amending statute as declaratory since the parent statute was clear with neither any obvious omission nor ambiguity in its understanding. In the Sree Sankaracharya case, a government order related to the University Grants Scheme 1998 substantially modified the existing law. It imposed new burdens on and took away anticipated benefits from the PhD teachers whom the provisions concerned with. Hence, it was not given a retrospective effect. \n\nApart from the legislature creating new rights and obligations using the garb of a clarificatory statute, two other reasons can explain the rising negative connotations towards retrospectivity, and, in turn, clarificatory amendments. First, the frequency of these legislations is a cause of concern. For instance, the amendments to the Income-tax Act 1961 have been described as so short-lived that new provisions are substituted even before a strong judicial opinion on the existing law can be formed. This leads to a loss of stability and certainty in the legal system, which also ties into the second reason - the change in the country's economic circumstances. While the recent wave of disguised clarificatory amendments is a problem that predominantly plagues the tax system, the effect is cross-sectorial. Retrospectively making substantive changes to the law erodes the basic foundations of certainty and lends a negative perception to the legal system overall. The increased requirement to negate such a perception of the legal system is due to the changed economic situation. The country's economic growth needs foreign investments, which, in turn, requires a global image to be painted. Such a heightened necessity has led to the degradation of the concept of retrospective application of law, including in cases of clarificatory amendments. \n\nWay Forward \n\nDespite the recent wave of criticism terming clarificatory legislations as a menace, as discussed above, retrospective application of such amendments has been necessary given the benefit they serve to the public. As recent as 2017, in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Prasad Verma, the Supreme Court upheld the retrospective application of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concessions Rules (Amendment) Act 2001 since it was found to be explanatory both in its purpose and nature without any indication to the contrary. \n\nOn the other hand, to nip this controversy in the bud, the government should take a cautionary approach towards retrospective application of laws. Explanatory amendments must be within the scope of the earlier provision and must not introduce a substantive change to the existing law. The effects of the latter statute, like divesting rights already vested, should be carefully scrutinized, especially before calling it a clarificatory amendment.\n\nTherefore, while most tend to term clarificatory amendments as entirely negative, it is pertinent to understand that such a characterization is an oversimplification. Despite the pitfalls, clarificatory amendments are a necessary evil. \nClarificatoryAmendmentRetrospectivity\nLaw and Policy\n170 views\n4 likes. Post not marked as liked\n4"

        "title": "SEBI’s Expansion of ESG Mutual Funds Schemes: Demystifying its Implications",
        "content": "Pavitra Priyadarshan, Aryaa Parulekar\nAug 16\n7 min read\nSEBI’s Expansion of ESG Mutual Funds Schemes: Demystifying its Implications\n[Pavitra and Aryaa are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) norms are acknowledged as a sustainable standard of investing that facilitates long-term financial goals and positively impacts society. ESG mutual funds scheme is a form of green financing that refers to equity funds investing in companies that satisfy certain established ESG standards. Originating in the United States, the Pax Fund was the first to incorporate ESG standards as the criteria for investment in 1971. The term 'ESG' was popularized by the WHO Report titled Who Cares Wins in 2004, which suggested sustainable methods to integrate ESG into investment activities. \n\nIndia saw the incorporation of the ESG norms in 2012 when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the Business Responsibility Reports that directed companies to report compliance with the ESG standards. These standards gained substantial traction as a benchmark of investment in nations after COVID-19, as investors saw the need to invest in responsible enterprises. Consequently, there has been a rise in need for vigilance of mis-selling in ESG investments, with international institutions such as OECD and UN emphasizing the efficient implementation of ESG guidelines with a robust disclosure framework.\n\nTo meet the demand for green financing and transparency, and to alleviate greenwashing in India, there is a necessity to introduce “consistent, comparable and decision useful schemes.” In line with this objective, SEBI issued a circular on 20 July 2023, notifying the introduction of a new sub-category of ESG mutual funds schemes and enhancing the disclosure requirements. Now, investors are equipped with various ESG schemes and investment strategies.  \n\nThis article offers an overview of the existing framework and endeavors to examine the essential features and the possible implications of the SEBI’s circular. It subsequently assesses pertinent issues and pushes for effective implementation of the amended framework in the Indian context.\n\nThe Existing Framework and Overview of the SEBI Circular\n\nUnder the existing regulations, mutual funds can bring out only one ESG scheme under the thematic category of equity schemes. Thematic funds are equity mutual funds that invest in stocks with a particular theme. ESG funds are such thematic mutual funds that invest in companies with a demonstrable commitment to the environment, social causes, and governance. With the increase in ESG investments in the Indian market, SEBI found that mitigation of greenwashing, mis-selling, and ensuring greater transparency through enhanced disclosures was a dire requirement. Consequently, SEBI introduced a circular on 20 July 2023 to facilitate green financing. \n\nThe asset management companies (AMCs) can now launch one ESG scheme under the 6 specified categories. These are (i) exclusions, (ii) integration, (iii) best-in-class and positive screening, (iv) impact investing, (v) sustainable objectives, and (vi) transition or transition related investments. \n\nThe exclusions sub-category aims to exclude certain securities on the basis of ESG related activities, business practices, or business segments. The integration sub-category considers ESG parameters material to the risk and return of investment along with traditional financial factors. The best-in-class and positive screening sub-category focuses on investing in companies that perform better than their peers on ESG indicators. The impact investing sub-category envisages generating a positive and measurable social or environmental impact in addition to financial return. The sustainable objective sub-category directs investment in sectors, industries, or companies that are anticipated to benefit from long-term macro or structural ESG-related trends. Lastly, the transition or transition related investments sub-category targets companies and issuers that assist environmental transition and just transition, focusing on generating positive and measurable social and environmental impact. \n\nIn line with its underlying motive to reinforce ESG commitment and encourage responsible investing in ESG, SEBI has also mandated a minimum investment of 80% of the total assets under management (AUM) in equity and equity-related instruments of the chosen strategy of the scheme. Moreover, it has put in an additional safeguard by placing a restriction on mutual funds from investing the remaining portion of 20% for purposes in contrast to the adopted strategy. \n\nTackling the issues of transparency and accountability, the SEBI’s circular mandates mutual funds to provide the name of the ESG strategy in the name of the concerned ESG scheme. Mutual funds are to ensure that the monthly portfolio of ESG schemes is inclusive of security-wise Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) Core scores, BRSR scores, and the names of the ESG Rating Providers along with their respective ESG scores. These additional disclosures highlight SEBI’s efforts to implement tighter compliances to mitigate greenwashing. \n\nIn furtherance of the above-mentioned motive, SEBI now requires ESG schemes to invest a minimum of 65% of their AUM in listed entities which are reporting on comprehensive BRSR disclosures and providing assurance on BRSR Core disclosures. Furthermore, stressing on the need for transparency, SEBI has set a threefold requirement upon AMCs. First, they have to disclose the votes cast on resolutions of their investee companies. Second, they must provide a rationale to support the voting decision. Third, they must mention the environmental, social, or governance reasons for supporting or discouraging the resolution. Further, these voting disclosures must be made on the websites of the respective AMCs every quarter.  \n\nWith the introduction of the new categories and enhancement of disclosures, SEBI’s effort of aligning investment schemes with ESG principles and guiding the financial sector towards a positive social and environmental change becomes apparent. \n\nImplications of the SEBI Circular\n\nThe SEBI, through its circular, has attempted to reinforce the existing framework of ESG mutual funds schemes by introducing categorization of the schemes and enhanced disclosure requirements. The incorporation of the changes introduced has wide implications. \n\nPertinent issues that need to be addressed\n\nThe introduction of the new category of ESG schemes offering unique strategies will add to an already extensive list of schemes available to investors. This will make the retail investment vehicle complex, resulting in more confusion when choosing the correct scheme with the right investment strategy from the pool of available schemes. \n\nSecondly, institutional investors are the driving force behind revamping ESG compliances in the international setting. However, the trend has been different in India, where fund managers prompt the need to bolster these guidelines and regulations. This has led to investors’ lack of awareness, increasing the possibility of greenwashing. The intended impact of SEBI’s amended framework can only be realized if the investors are aware of the various ESG schemes. Investor knowledge is crucial for making informed investment choices which will give way to responsible investing and mitigation of greenwashing. \n\nLastly, after an investment of a minimum of 80% of total assets by an investor in a particular strategy, they are barred from adopting a new investment strategy for the remaining portion of the total assets. This bar, to a certain extent, affects investing autonomy. Further, it significantly reduces the scope for correcting an error in picking the right strategy. Therefore, it needs to be ensured that investment is made in the correct strategy. As investors rely upon advisors to recommend the correct scheme with the right strategy which aligns with their objective, proper training of the investment advisors becomes vital. Further, proper guidance will ensure the integration of ESG compliances while evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nIs the circular fulfilling its objective?\n\nWhile SEBI’s amended framework is a welcome move towards achieving the set ESG standards, it is necessary to assess how the amendments fare in the practical scenario.\n\nFirst, to tackle the inconsistencies in ESG labelling of mutual funds, the regulators mandated mutual funds to state the name of the schemes adopted. However, to ensure clarity, additional filters were needed in ESG schemes. With the introduction of a sub-category of thematic equity funds, mutual funds have to disclose the underlying category of investment strategy along with the name of the scheme adopted. This fulfills the requirement of clarity by providing greater transparency. \n\nSecond, fund managers will be accountable for the approach adopted as the amended framework will prevent the earlier practice of managers relying on the company’s or third parties’ reports for the purpose of disclosure. These reports often use discretionary methods and apply unscientific evaluation standards of risk management. This, coupled with additional disclosure requirements, will ensure greater transparency in the ESG market, thereby significantly reducing the scope of greenwashing and mis-selling on the grounds of fake compliance with ESG standards. \n\nThird, despite the circular bringing about a significant advancement in the current ESG norms, India is still at a nascent stage. Therefore, the concerted effort by SEBI to uplift the Indian finance market to global standards needs to be steady and in a phased manner. Considering the country’s unique and diverse nature of the market, specific financial situation, and transition goals for various industries, the approach adopted should be adaptable and sustainable. This will contribute to the effectiveness of ESG disclosures by enabling them to meet the worldwide criteria.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SEBI’s circular primarily introduced sub-categorization of ESG mutual funds schemes and enhanced the disclosure requirements. The steps taken by SEBI are commendable for facilitating a framework for a fair assessment of ESG schemes. The initiative to expand the offering basket in ESG will encourage mutual funds and provide investors with much-needed flexibility to bring their investments in line with their ESG principles. In furtherance of the ESG goals in the investment landscape, this circular has brought in necessary safeguards for investor protection, transparency, corporate governance, and accountability to mitigate greenwashing. Consequently, the investor’s trust in the thematic funds will increase, allowing an increased focus on environmental protection and investor protection. \n\nThe newly instituted ESG categories and enhanced disclosures are a major step towards harmonizing Indian ESG standards with global markets. Moreover, the continuous growth of the Indian ESG Market warrants a periodic review of regulations as this will allow the framework to be updated with the recent market practices and investment opportunities. Lastly, despite the circular opening up new investment avenues, more options mean more confusion in picking the correct strategy. This accentuates the need for investor knowledge, as awareness of ESG schemes and what they entail is a key prerequisite for responsible and effective investing.\nESGSEBIESG Rating ProvidersBRSRAUM\nCorporate Law\n72 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "‘Material Non-Public Information’ in SEBI’s Consultation Paper: Implications and Probable Outcomes",
        "content": "Adarsh Agarwal\nAug 14\n4 min read\n‘Material Non-Public Information’ in SEBI’s Consultation Paper: Implications and Probable Outcomes\n[Adarsh is a student at National Law University and Judicial Academy Assam.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came out with a consultation paper on 18 May 2023, inviting comments for the introduction of SEBI (Prohibition of Unexplained Suspicious Trading Activities in the Securities Market) Regulations 2023 (Draft Regulations) into the securities regime. The Draft Regulations seek to cover material non-public information (MNPI) under the veil of suspicious trading activity, thereby enabling the regulatory body to frame charges based on unexplained trading patterns. The Draft Regulations highlight SEBI’s endeavor to circumvent its liability of establishing guilt by way of direct evidence and has imposed a duty on the accused to disprove the charges – which merely qualify as ‘allegations’ – levelled against such person. This article is an attempt to delve into the concept of MNPI and its impact on the securities law if the Draft Regulations are brought into force. \n\nDelineating the Interplay between UPSI and MNPI\n\nSEBI introduced the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015 (PIT Regulations) to curb the practice of insider trading and deal with the lacunae of the erstwhile regime. The regulations provide clarity with respect to qualification as an insider and what constitutes unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). \n\nRegulation 2(1)(n) of the PIT Regulations provides for UPSI as information, with respect to a company, which holds the power to materially affect the price of its securities in case such information becomes available to the general public. The nature of UPSI is in the form of information which does not form part of the public domain. In contrast to this, Regulation 2(1)(f) of the Draft Regulations provides for a similar but a wider definition of MNPI thereby blurring the distinguishing factor between the two definitions. MNPI includes such information which was not generally available to the public and the same information had an impact on the price of the securities once it was made available. It also includes information with respect to any impending order, in relation to a security, on a recognized stock exchange or any information imparted by an influencer in the form of recommendations for a security. To simplify this, the definition of MNPI entails that all UPSI is MNPI, but all MNPI cannot be UPSI.\n\nThe idea behind the Draft Regulations highlights the motive of the securities regulator to deal with the practice of insider trading by bringing it under the ambit of MNPI. The PIT Regulations encompass an elaborate procedure with respect to investigation, reporting and framing of charges – based on evidence – against the accused. Explanation to Regulation 2(1)(g) clearly lays down that ‘the onus of showing that a certain person was in possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of trading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge...’ Under the Draft Regulations, SEBI is empowered to assert its claim on the basis of certain identified circumstances. This opens a Pandora's box comprising allegations based on circumstantial evidence becoming the general notion for determining insider trading cases. In such a case, the burden of proving that the allegations put forward are false by its nature then rests with the accused. \n\nAssessing the Current Framework \n\nThe PIT Regulations impose a liability on SEBI to establish the existence of trade based on UPSI. The burden of proof in cases pertaining to insider trading is on the regulatory body – SEBI. The case of Balram Garg v. Securities and Exchange Board of India acts as a precedent for determining the degree of reliance that can be placed on circumstantial evidence in contrast to direct evidence to establish the presence of UPSI and the burden of proof in such insider trading cases. In the given case, the alleged insiders belonged to the promoter family (PC Jeweller group) and were charged with trading of the company’s shares based on UPSI. The regulatory body concluded it to be a case of insider trading and the same was upheld by the Securities Appellate Tribunal.\n\nThe Supreme Court, overturning the decisions of the above-mentioned bodies, held that, under PIT Regulations, insiders cannot be identified on the basis of trading patterns and timing of trading – “The trading pattern…cannot be the circumstantial evidence to prove the communication of UPSI…”. The Hon’ble court also held that the onus to prove that the alleged insiders were in possession of UPSI lay on SEBI by virtue of the PIT Regulations. In such cases, reliance could not be placed on evidence inferred through the given circumstances and production of cogent materials becomes necessary to establish communication of UPSI. \n\nIn the above case, the Supreme Court has clearly reiterated its position with respect to insider trading and consequently, suspicious trading activity cannot be made use of to deal with trading based on UPSI – MNPI encompasses UPSI within itself. In insider trading cases, the regulatory body is not permitted to transfer the onus of proof on the person against whom the allegations have been made. \n\nThe introduction of the Draft Regulations is SEBI’s attempt to exonerate itself from adhering to the established procedure laid down under the PIT Regulations and arguably misuse its position by treating UPSI as MNPI, enabling it to deal with insider trading under suspicious trading activities. This would also put the burden of proof on the accused, unlike the PIT Regulations. Such an act would reduce the status of PIT Regulations to mere discretion in nature as the Draft Regulations would have an overriding effect over the former regulations. The Draft Regulations, if brought into operation, might result in SEBI taking an action exceeding its authority by dealing with UPSI under MNPI, thus violating the stand taken by the Supreme Court.  \n\nConclusion\n\nInsider trading has been a major concern for decades, highlighting the need for a much stronger securities regime. The Supreme Court has tried to limit the use of circumstantial evidence in cases pertaining to insider trading. But what remains to be seen is how MNPI would be interpreted to determine suspicious trading activity with the looming possibility of insider trading being dragged under it. The action taken by SEBI sheds light on certain considerations – whether there was really an urgent need for new Regulations to counter existing problems of insider trading and how PIT Regulations would be viewed through the eyes of SEBI if the Draft Regulations are brought into operation as discussed in this article.\nInsider TradingMaterialNon-PublicInformationSEBIConsultation PaperUPSI\nCorporate Law\n203 views\n7 likes.

        "content": "Aditya Roy, Aadhruti Vangaveti\nAug 12\n6 min read\nSEBI's Recent LODR Amendments: Further Bridging Information Asymmetry\n[Aadhruti and Aditya are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe recent amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR) have once again aligned with the regulator’s aim of bridging the information gap between the listed companies and the market participants through comprehensive regulations. \n\nThe trading of securities is based on a lot of speculation where investors use hard information and a rigorous analysis to form a speculative view of the stock they are interested in buying. Hence, availability of such information on the listed entity in the market becomes essential in helping prospective buyers to fairly value each security. In this context, the LODR is the leading authoritative text governing the principles of disclosures required of listed entities. It also provides for corporate governance requirements relating to the board of directors, key managerial persons, promoters etcetera. These governance requirements become essential for creating stability and consistency in the market, thus ensuring that the performance of the securities is independent of corporate actions.  The regulations were introduced to create more compliant listed companies and improve the capital markets in India. The 14 June 2023 notification brings in a fresh set of streamlined disclosure requirements for increased transparency by universalizing what needs to be disclosed. \n\nWhat Has Changed?\n\nPrior to the amendment, the LODR provided companies with subjective assessment of disclosures resulting in adverse information asymmetry since they could easily circle around their obligations through the excessive discretion afforded to them. Regulation 30 read with Schedule III of the LODR provides for disclosure requirements to the Stock Exchange from the Listed Companies on the basis of 'materiality'. Schedule III, Part A enlists certain events, further categorized into Para A and Para B. While the former mandates the disclosure of the specified material events, the latter provides for assessment of materiality by the companies themselves. The criteria for this assessment was prescribed within the three-pronged provision in Sub-Regulation 4, Clause (i). On the basis such determination, listed entities formulate their own test/policy of materiality, as prescribed under Clause (ii). This prescribed assessment gave significant leeway to companies since Sub-Clause (c) of Clause (i) read with Clause (ii) provides for a subjective assessment through the 'opinion of the board of directors' without having to provide reasons for the same. \n\nWith the amendment now in place, SEBI aims to make disclosure requirements more objective and quantitative by providing for their numerical thresholds. Provision VII of the amendment provides that events in Para B must be disclosed if they meet thresholds which relate to the quantified value or impact on a company's financials such as turnover, net worth or profit or loss after tax deduction. Further, the amendment inserts a key provision after Clause (ii), aimed at solidifying these objective criteria. Policies/ tests of materiality formulated by the listed companies must now ensure that any of the prescribed criteria mentioned in the amended regulations are not diluted, thus increasing transparency in company policies while reducing the scope for possible loopholes simultaneously. \n\nDisclosure requirements were earlier only for Part A events with an umbrella timeline of twenty-four hours. The amendment now prescribes a clear time demarcation for Part A and Part B events, on the basis of their source. Events emanating from the board of directors’ meeting or from within the listed company (i.e., internal events), are required to be disclosed within 30 minutes and 12 hours respectively, whereas events which are external in their source have 24 hours for their disclosure.  \n\nPrecise additions have been made to previously broad Regulation 30(11) that the top 100 and thereafter the top 250 companies are now required to confirm the veracity of events or information reported to mainstream media within 24 hours of their reporting. These must be events which are indicative of a public rumor that is circulating amidst the investing public. From a bird's eye view, this amendment aims at creating obligations on the companies rather than giving them the option to take action on their own initiative.  \n\nCertain personnel of the company (shareholders, promoters, directors, KMPs, employees, etc.) who are parties to any agreements specified within Clause 5A, to which the listed entity is not a party, must disclose these to the listed company. These agreements must be of such a nature so as to affect the management of the company, directly or indirectly except those executed in their 'normal course of business'. This amendment ensures that the public investors are aware of any third-party commitments of the listed entity in a timely manner. The only potential drawback could be that since the listed company is not a party to the agreement, such disclosures could- i) hamper the agreement’s completion due to breach in confidentiality or ii) be challenged on the grounds of contractual privity. A closer analysis of the provisions highlighted in this section emphasize the amendment’s multiple benefits for the market.\n\nEffectiveness of Disclosures: An Analysis \nDisclosure of information by listed companies is essential for a variety of reasons such as- for the informed decision-making by investors among other stakeholders such as banks. However, disclosure of information has become important at a much higher level, that is, for the effective functioning of capital markets altogether. Company leadership is in the position of possessing exclusive information regarding profitability of investments, revenue streams and changes in strategy among others. Since investors and other firms which provide capital to these companies require such information for optimum allocation of resources, a set of regulations mandating disclosure become important for facilitating the functioning of capital markets. Moreover, one of the important reasons for stock price inaccuracy is non-public information, where information crucial for determining share value is not known by the majority of investors. The solution to this information gap induced share value is proper disclosure requirements. Similarly, confirming or denying the veracity of events or information reported in mainstream media can also decrease speculation in the market, thus creating a more stable market.\n\nThe new objective criteria will lead to a uniform disclosure of information by listed companies for capital providers to make a comprehensive decision. It will also help eliminate any advantages that a company might gain due to the earlier subjective requirements for disclosure. However, this also benefits the listed companies since with lesser discretion in their hands they could now comply with the objective criteria and avoid future punitive action by SEBI against them which leads to unavoidable losses in the market. \n\nOn the forefront, the new requirements may seem beneficial to the companies as well since with more objective norms and lesser managerial discretion, companies will have a more compliant executive which may not be able to use its position to gain personal benefits out of the company’s shares. However, this has an underlying problem of the decreasing total income for the executive which can in turn cost the companies more in compensation. The burden of executive pay would simply transfer from the market to the company. Moreover, there still runs the risk of executives endangering the entire company for personal gain since scandalous incidents relating to managerial positions hardly stay insulated from the stock market’s ripple effects. \n\nWith the amendment there is now an obligation to disclose specific agreements (irrespective of the listed entity being a party), the requirement for the opinion of the board of directors on the vested interests of the entity in such agreements and further, the approval from the shareholders. These changes are a welcome step to ensure that there is no information disparity between the management and shareholders of the entity and thereafter the public at large. This effectively curbs instances of promoters singlehandedly restricting the shareholder involvement. \n\nMoreover, with set standards for what shall be considered material under Schedule III, Part A, Para B, consistency of crucial information will also be maintained. The importance of disclosure of information is crucial to the risk assessment by investors, which is at the core of allocation of capital, especially for equity investors. Since there is an uncertainty around ROIs on stocks, information disclosure, which can even remotely affect prices, becomes important. As the Consultation Paper on Strengthening Corporate Governance - Amendments to the SEBI in point 3.8 highlights, the new amendments are the need of the hour to ensure the protection of shareholders in listed companies and thus uphold the principles of corporate governance.\n\nConclusion\n\nDisclosure requirements are crucial for a transparent and efficient functioning of any capital market. With increased objectivity and stricter time-bound requirements, SEBI has pushed for symmetrical information disclosure among the specified listed companies. SEBI has introduced these amendments with a clear intention to remove information asymmetry in the market as well as streamline corporate governance norms for listed companies. The resultant changes clearly have the potential to positively influence the market and instill more confidence in investors. However, how companies will embrace these changes is still subject to speculation.\nSEBILODRCorporate Governance\nCorporate Law\n213 views\n3 likes. Post not marked as liked\n3"

        "title": "The Stamp Duty Conundrum: Unstamped Arbitration Agreements Examined in NN Global",
        "content": "Basil Gupta\nAug 11\n7 min read\nThe Stamp Duty Conundrum: Unstamped Arbitration Agreements Examined in NN Global\n[Basil is a student at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\nArbitration is a commonly used alternative dispute resolution method for commercial conflicts. It entails a contractual agreement between two parties, specifying that any disputes arising between them will be resolved through arbitration. However, if the agreement lacks the required stamp, it can be disputed regarding its enforceability, according to the provisions outlined in the Indian Stamp Act 1899 (Stamp Act).\n\nAccording to the Stamp Act, any agreement that lacks the proper stamp cannot be presented as evidence in a court of law. Consequently, an unstamped agreement cannot be utilized to prove the presence of an arbitration agreement, which is a necessary requirement for initiating arbitration proceedings. The Supreme Court (SC) provided a final resolution to this issue in the case of NN Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Limited (NN Global). In this article, the author analyses the said judgment by comparing it to the pre-conditions of this judgment and its impact on the arbitration mechanism in India.\n\nSituation Before the Proclamation of NN Global\n\nThe Stamp Act necessitates the payment of stamp duty upon the execution of specific documents. According to Section 33 of the Stamp Act, it is the duty of the courts to examine whether an instrument has been properly stamped. Furthermore, Section 35 of the Stamp Act specifies that an inadequately stamped contract cannot be admitted as evidence in a court of law. The issue of whether an arbitration agreement contained within a contract, which lacks the appropriate stamp as per the provisions of Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act, can be enforced and binding has been a topic of extensive deliberation in recent times.\n\nIn the SMS Tea Estates (Private) Limited v. Chandmari Tea Company (Private) Limitd case, the SC stated that an unstamped agreement can be enforced in arbitration if it is stamped before filing the arbitration petition. The court emphasized that the Stamp Act aims to ensure government revenue from agreements, not to invalidate them. Hence, the court held that an unstamped agreement can be stamped before initiating the arbitration petition, allowing the enforcement of the arbitration agreement within it.\n\nAdditionally, the court ruled that an unstamped agreement cannot enforce its arbitration agreement if it is not properly stamped before the arbitration petition is filed. The court acknowledged that the Stamp Act aims to prevent the evasion of stamp duty, and enforcing an unstamped agreement would contradict the objectives of the statute. Therefore, the court held that if an agreement remains unstamped at the time of filing the arbitration petition, the contained arbitration agreement cannot be enforced.\n\nIn Garware Wall Ropes Limited v. Coastal Marine Constructions and Engineering Limited, the SC addressed the issue of appointing an arbitrator when the agreement, including the arbitration clause, lacks the necessary stamp. The court determined that the arbitration clause cannot be treated as separate from the agreement as a whole. They clarified that the Stamp Act applies to the entire agreement, making it impossible to enforce the arbitration clause independently if the agreement is not properly stamped.\n\nThe SC established a principle that if a contract with an arbitration clause lacks proper stamping, it cannot be enforced. However, the court reconsidered its stance, overturning previous judgments on the validity and enforceability of unstamped arbitration agreements.\n\nNN Global\n\nInterplay between the Arbitration Act and the Indian Contract Act 1872\n\nIn the present case, the SC made an observation that only agreements that can be enforced by law are regarded as contracts according to the Indian Contract Act 1872. The court then proceeded to interpret Section 35 of the Stamp Act, which states that any document lacking appropriate stamping or having insufficient stamp duty cannot be admitted as evidence. The court also noted that this provision is explicitly worded and does not provide any exceptions for unstamped documents, unlike unregistered registerable documents.\n\nThe court observed that unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreements cannot be enforced as per the Stamp Act. Such agreements are not considered legally valid until they undergo the validation process outlined in the statute. The court also noted that the arbitration clause, being independent of the main contract, cannot be used if the instrument is unstamped, as it would create a separate transaction.\n\nSection 33 and Section 35 of the Stamp Act\n\nThe court interpreted Section 33 of the Stamp Act as whenever an authority is presented with an instrument or document, it is their obligation to assess whether the proper stamp duty has been paid. If it is discovered that the instrument does not comply with the stamping requirements mentioned in Section 33(2), the authority is required to seize the said instrument.\n\nWhile interpreting Section 35 of the Stamp Act, the court stated when an instrument is considered inadmissible because it is either unstamped or inadequately stamped, it can still be made admissible by paying the required stamp duty and a penalty later on. This demonstrates that the requirement stated in Section 35 is not strict and can be addressed at a later stage. An instrument that lacks proper stamping does not lose all validity; instead, it can be legalized and used as evidence once the conditions outlined in the proviso to Section 35 are fulfilled.\n\nSection 11 of the Arbitration Act 1996\n\nRegarding Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Arbitration Act), the court stated that a valid contract is necessary for this provision to apply. It means there must be a legally enforceable agreement, not just an arbitration agreement. The aim of Section 11(6A) is to reduce court interference and not to ignore other laws like the Stamp Act.\n\nThe court also discussed the submission of a certified copy of the arbitration agreement when appointing arbitrators. It was argued that since the certified copy cannot be held back under the Stamp Act, the court cannot consider the sufficiency of stamp duty. The court clarified that while a certified copy is required, the original document must show proof of stamp duty payment. If the original document is not adequately stamped, the court cannot take any action based on the certified copy, even if it can’t be held back under the Stamp Act.\n\nThe doctrine of severability in arbitration\n\nIn international arbitration, it is widely accepted that an arbitration agreement is separate from the underlying commercial contract. This principle, known as severability or separability, means that if the main contract becomes invalid or ends, the arbitration agreement remains valid. The UNCITRAL Model Law and the Arbitration Act recognize this distinction. As long as the arbitration agreement is not null, inoperative, or impossible to fulfil, parties must resolve their disputes through arbitration.\n\nDoctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz \n\nThe doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz was also raised as an argument in the NN Global case. This doctrine states that the arbitral tribunal has the competence to determine and rule on its own jurisdiction, including objections regarding the existence, validity, and scope of the arbitration agreement. Over time, this doctrine has developed to minimize court interference at the pre-arbitration stage and to discourage baseless challenges to the tribunal’s jurisdiction. In the NN Global case, it was contended that considering the legislative intent, the goal should be to facilitate a seamless and unobstructed process for seeking arbitration. In simpler terms, unless blatantly void, decisions regarding the arbitrability of a subject matter should be left to the arbitral tribunal.\n\nThe dissenting opinion\n\nThe minority held that the court could skip examining stamp duty before referring the case to arbitration. They believed it would complicate the process and cause delays. They also noted that stamping is a curable defect, so it doesn’t invalidate the arbitration agreement. They emphasized party autonomy in arbitration and the need for limited court intervention, and mentioned that Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act restricts judicial interference to administrative orders.\n\nThe minority view stated that all disputes should be resolved by the arbitrator(s) under Section 16 of Arbitration Act, including the examination of stamp duty, to prevent delays in initiating proceedings.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe recent decision presents a dilemma for arbitration agreements executed outside India. Instruments executed abroad are not stamped according to Indian fiscal laws. While initially valid and enforceable outside India, they lose their validity upon entry into the country unless properly stamped. The stamping requirements depend on the jurisdiction where the document is used to enforce the arbitration clause. For instance, in Mumbai, the Maharashtra Stamp Act 1958 applies. The stamp authorities of that jurisdiction handle the adjudication process, which may involve fees and specific procedures. Parties opting for arbitration must be aware of the stamping laws in the relevant state and anticipate potential delays in the adjudication process.\n\nThe SC’s majority view lacks clarity on how parties should handle urgent requests for interim relief or emergency awards when there are doubts about the adequacy of stamp duty. According to the NN Global decision, it appears that parties must first address the stamping issue before proceeding with such requests, which could be particularly challenging in international commercial arbitrations governed by Part I of the Arbitration Act. Even if interim relief is granted in the name of justice, if it later turns out that the arbitration agreement was not properly stamped, it could invalidate the entire agreement and any outcomes resulting from it.\n\nIn contrast to the majority judgments, the minority judgments acknowledge the principles of severability and separability within arbitration agreements, which align with international standards. One could argue that these minority judgments better capture the true intent and essence of the Arbitration Act, as they seek to minimize judicial interference.\n\nAlso, the Delhi High Court (DHC), in the case of ARG Outlier Media Private Limited v. HT Media Limited, held that if an agreement with insufficient stamping is admitted as evidence and used as the basis for an arbitral award, it cannot be challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The DHC invoked Section 36 of the Stamp Act which prohibits questioning the admissibility of an instrument once it has been accepted as evidence, except under Section 61 of the Stamp Act. The court made it clear that it does not act as an appellate court in relation to the award, thereby lacking the powers granted by Section 61 of the Stamp Act. Even if Section 61 were found to be applicable, the court’s authority would be confined to impounding the document and referring it to the Collector of Stamps to ascertain the proper stamp duty and penalty. However, this process would not have any bearing on the enforceability or validity of the arbitral award.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent ruling by the larger bench in NN Global has once again raised questions about the interplay between substantive contracts and the arbitration clauses contained therein. Going forward, parties will need to be cautious about complying with the stamp duty payment requirements mandated by the Stamp Act. Additionally, the decision has also created a problem for parties using institutional arbitration. Even after fixing stamping defects, they may have no enforceable remedy. The strict interpretation of the fiscal law allows the other party to deny rights, leaving the claimant unable to enforce valid contractual rights. This makes institutional arbitration riskier than ad hoc arbitration. Without government intervention, institutional arbitration may no longer be preferred in India.\nNN GlobalStamp ActArbitration and ConciliationArbitration Act\nDispute Resolution\n413 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Direct Stress on Indirect Taxes of the Online Gaming Industry",
        "content": "Shubham Singh\nAug 6\n5 min read\nDirect Stress on Indirect Taxes of the Online Gaming Industry\n[Shubham is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nOnline gaming has become a popular pastime in India, with millions of people playing games for fun and for money. The judiciary and the legislative had taken different approaches to regulating online gaming in the past creating a tussle between themselves. For example, The Madras bill categorized rummy and poker as gambling, despite legal precedents establishing them as games of skill. The Government of Karnataka’s previous ban on online gaming was overturned by the High Court due to infringement on free speech and expression rights. \n\nTaxation in the online gaming industry, specifically, the goods and services tax (GST), differentiates skill-based (18% tax) from chance-based games (28% tax). However, this differentiation was done away with by the 50th meeting of the GST Council, where it was recommended by the council that casino, horse racing and online gaming should be uniformly taxed at a rate of 28%, not making a distinction between a 'game of skill' and a 'game of chance'.\n\nIn the present article, the author analyzes the conundrum between a ‘game of chance’ and a ‘game of skill’ with respect to the decision of the Karnataka High Court discussed below and subsequently discuss the decision of the GST Council which makes the aforementioned decision and issue infructuous. \n\nSolving a Conundrum While Creating a New One\n\nIn the case of Gameskraft Technologies Private Limited v. Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence, it was seen that the legislature disregarded the judiciary’s interpretation of the law, imposing the full-face value of GST on games despite prior rulings categorizing them as skill-based. In an ideal situation, the legislature is expected to place reliance on the definition of a ‘game of skill’ and a ‘game of chance’ using a predominant test that was established by the judiciary. However, there was a discrepancy in the interpretation of the definitions of ‘game of skill’ and ‘game of chance’ and the predominant factor test by the legislature and the GST departments. Essentially, due to the absence of a specific list of games that fall under the categories of 'skill' and 'chance' and a clear definition within the GST legislation, the GST body as a whole relied on judicial interpretations but retained the freedom and discretion to interpret such definitions based on their understanding of those definitions. This lack of uniformity in the interpretation of taxes on the online gaming industry arose as a result.\n\nThe recent recommendation by the GST Council solves this conundrum of uniformity in the legislation, although affecting the online gaming industry and disregarding the interpretation by the judiciary in the process. \n\nCritical Analysis\n\nPursuant to the GST Council Recommendations, the government wants to levy the 28% tax not just on the commissions, but on the entire pot of money. This will have a heavy impact on the online gaming industry. The recommendations made did not address the distinction between games of skill and games of chance in the context of online gaming. The absence of a clear distinction between games of skill and games of chance in the context of online gaming creates ambiguity around these recommendations. The rationale behind this differentiation is that skill-based games are considered more akin to services requiring specific expertise and effort from the player, while chance-based games rely predominantly on luck or random outcomes. It was done to ensure a fair and equitable taxation framework for the online gaming industry. \n\nWhile arguments to sustain these recommendations can be that online games are often perceived to involve more chance due to the use of random number generators to determine outcomes, leading to comparisons with gambling rather than purely skill-based games. The Indian Judiciary has in the past observed that the principles applied to offline games should extend to online platforms, ensuring consistency as if a game has predominantly skill-based offline, it will have the same application online. Take the example of horse racing, it involves the breeding, training, and racing of horses. It is the skillful application of training and racing strategies that determine a horse's overall success and is the dominant factor in determining the outcome of the game and it was treated as a skill-based game. \n\nIrrespective of the consideration given to the skill and chance-based factors, the imposition of taxes on the full value of bets placed in online gaming is unduly stringent and poses a significant detriment to the Indian market for the online gaming industry. This approach is viewed as excessively harsh and has the potential to undermine the growth and sustainability of the industry severely. Online gaming companies had anticipated being taxed based on gross gaming revenue (GGR), aligning with industry expectations and international practices which are followed by countries such as the UK, Australia, Italy, Sweden, Singapore, Malaysia, etc., which would have provided a more balanced and conducive taxation framework. The GGR is essentially the total amount of money a gambling business brings in through bets deducting the amount that is paid for the win. GGR is a fair tax base and it captures the entire amount of revenue that an operator generates from gaming, regardless of whether the operator wins or loses. GGR is also a progressive tax base since it would mean that operators with higher GGR will pay more GST, which helps to ensure that the tax burden is shared fairly.\n\nWhile the aim of achieving legislative uniformity is commendable, it is evident that there is a lack of harmonious treatment of this issue with both the judiciary and the online gaming industry. One potential solution could have been the inclusion of a precise delineation of games of skill, chance, and gambling within the GST legislation by the Central Government. Moreover, this solution necessitates the provision of a comprehensive list specifying which games fall under the categories of skill, chance, and gambling, while duly considering judicial interpretations. By adopting this approach, the GST department would be empowered to accurately classify games, thereby eliminating any ambiguity regarding their categorization as games of chance, skill, or gambling. This, in turn, would have offered a lucid framework to both the judiciary and the online gaming industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the recent recommendations by the GST Council to uniformly tax online gaming at 28%, regardless of whether it is a game of skill or chance, is a step in the right direction towards achieving legislative uniformity. However, it is important to ensure that this uniformity does not come at the expense of the online gaming industry. This situation sets an unfavorable precedent for the online gaming market and its future investments. The problem extends beyond the monetary aspects of the industry and affects its operational aspects as well, particularly the platforms that provide these services. It could lead to operators shifting their business to other countries with lower taxation rates.\nOnline GamingGSTGameskraft\nTaxation Law\n139 views\n7 likes. Post not marked as liked\n7"

        "title": "Viewing the RBI's New DLG Guidelines through a Fintech Company’s Lens",
        "content": "Sibasish Panda, Ayush Shandilya\nAug 6\n7 min read\nViewing the RBI's New DLG Guidelines through a Fintech Company’s Lens\n[Sibasish and Ayush are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nDigital lending has emerged as a crucial aspect of the financial sector, with numerous participants entering the market and providing quick access to credit for even small financial needs through online platforms. In a report, the Boston Consulting Group predicted that by 2023, almost 48% of the lending would be digital. In 2021, it was reported that lending start-ups would see a rise from 13% in 2020-21 to 35% in 2024-25 and that much of the venture funding went into fintech lending (29%), second only to payments. \n\nIndia is a hotspot for the rise of digital lending start-ups and fintech companies. Default loan guarantee (DLG) structures, which are an important part of the digital lending sphere, had come to a halt pursuant to their prohibition and unclear stance in the digital lending guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in September 2022 (September guidelines). \n\nAfter constant demands of the fintechs, the financial regulator changed its stance on the much-anticipated DLG structures. On the 8 June 2023, the financial regulator not only permitted these structures in the sphere of digital lending but also released guidelines for the same. The authors in the post analyze the viability of the same from a Fin-tech company’s perspective.\n\nWhat is a First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG)?\n\nAn FLDG is a contractual arrangement in which a third party such as a fintech company guarantees to cover only up to a certain percentage of the default in the loan portfolio of the regulated entity (RE) (bank or NBFC). However, the entire pool of loans is not guaranteed. It is different from a co-lending arrangement in the sense that the third party in an FLDG only guarantees the default and does not transfer the underlying loan exposure from the books of the RE to its books.\n\nThe RBI has made it clear that DLG arrangements will not be considered \"synthetic securitization\" or be subject to the regulations concerning \"loan participation.\" This decision could potentially provide commercial entities with new opportunities to effectively handle risk and enhance their loan servicing abilities, without having to deal with the complications associated with these two financial structures.\n\nThe RBI has expanded the scope of the definition of 'direct lending to government'. According to the new guidelines, implicit guarantees can now be included within 'direct lending to government' without being classified as \"synthetic securitization\" or falling under the provisions of \"loan participation.\" However, implicit guarantees will be subjected to the same requirements as explicit guarantees.\n\nOne Plus One Makes it Eleven\n\nFintech lending is an important piece in the financial landscape of the country. The traditional balance sheet lenders function by the traditional way of banking, hence they need the fintech companies which provide them the digital flavour and technical competence. The fintech companies act as a medium to connect the lender with the borrower. The required capital for loans is infused by the banks and the fin-techs through their technology help disseminate it to a large number of borrowers. This way, attention is also focused on the customers who are in actual need of loans. \n\nThe fintech companies (the DLG providers) also come up with technological advancements that assess the credit ratings of the borrowers. This helps the lenders find people credible enough to avail  the loan. In return, the fintechs provide a guarantee to the bank for the initial setback in case of a default. These kinds of structures also provide a cushion to investors in financing riskier projects\n\nIn return, the DLG providers will be paid some fees, the details of which are mentioned in the circular. Up till now, the DLG providers used to sweep a share of or the entire residual income in exchange for the guarantee provided. However, this also exposes them to certain risks. The regulator has left it to the parties to mutually decide and contract on the returns to be given to the DLG providers.\n\nThe Umbrella of RBI Regulation\n\nThe primary concern with the sphere of digital lending was its unregulated nature. In the September guidelines, RBI had taken the first step to assuage the same. With the recent FLDG guidelines, it has added the much-necessitated chink to its armor.\n\nAll the commercial banks including small finance banks, cooperative banks, and also the NBFCs are now covered under the sphere of REs. They can enter into DLG arrangements with lending service providers (LSPs). LSPs, as stated in the September guidelines, are not limited to REs. This is a departure from the RBI's Working Group report on 10 November 2021 (WG Report), which suggested prohibiting unregulated entities from participating in synthetic structures like FLDG to prevent them from assuming credit risk on the balance sheets of REs. However, the new DLG guidelines appear to allow even unregulated entities to serve as DLG providers. LSPs are, however, mandated to be incorporated as a company under the Companies Act 2013. \n\nThe REs can also enter into a DLG with another RE. These measures provide both the lender banks and the fintechs the much-needed regulatory oversight such as that of the Directorate of Enforcement along with the basic corporate governance compliance for the DLG provider entity. \n\nFree-hand to Fin-techs to Provide a Fillip to Innovation and Lending\n\nThe new guidelines burden the RE lenders with a lot of responsibilities to safeguard the sphere of digital lending. These include the recognition of non-performing assets and the various disclosure and due diligence requirements. The REs are required to put a Board-approved policy before entering into any DLG arrangement. RBI has also strictly prohibited DLG arrangements as a substitute for increasing credit worthiness of a borrower and mandated robust underwriting practices. \n\nFintech companies, on the other hand, liberated from extra compliances can focus on providing much-sought innovation and security to the digital lending sphere. The Indian fintech startups can come up with big-data and secure API connections to banking data coupled with artificial intelligence to assess the credit worthiness of the borrowers in a better way. They can study the borrower's behavior with the help of AI. These will prevent the REs from disbursing any bad loans to such borrowers.\n\nThe Dichotomy Around Guarantee Cap: Risk Mitigation or Risk Hindrance?\n\nRBI had, in its September guidelines, directed REs to adhere to the RBI Securitization of Standard Assets Directions 2021 while dealing with contractual arrangements such as FLDG. The fintechs, in compliance with the securitization cap, provided a guarantee of averaging around 20% of the loan portfolio. As the regulation was not clear on the same, LSPs sometimes covered even up to 100% of the loan generally averaging around 25-30%.\n\nThe market players contemplated the cap to be around 20% however prima facie many Fin-techs seem satisfied with the 5% cap that the RBI has mandated. It is believed to prevent unnecessary risky practices not suitable for the market. This would also bring much-needed confidence and certainty to the market which would contribute in the long run.\n\nHowever, on the other side of the coin, setting this limit will hinder NBFCs from engaging in high-risk sectors and has required significant arrangements for safeguarding against FLDG structures. Many of the fintech companies would be deterred from providing loans to anyone without a good CIBIL score. Sectors such as student loans or loans aimed at individuals in the blue-collar segment who have no credit history are generally deemed very risky, and both banks and NBFCs usually steer clear of them. However, certain lenders have managed to provide credit programs in these sectors with substantial coverage from fintech companies to protect against potential losses. With a cap of 5%, these lenders would face overly restricted risk exposure, making it difficult for them to operate effectively.\n\nUnravelling the Quirks: Calculating Guarantees in Loan Pools\n\nAnother concern that remains on this cap of 5% is around the unclear stance on its computation. An FLDG structure is a part of the so-called static loan cash flow modelling exercise which means if a loan of INR 100 crores is given and a guarantee is sought of INR 5 crores, the INR 100 crore loan will gradually amortize over time. The guarantee will remain at INR 5 crores till the loan drops to that value and then the guarantee will start decreasing along with the loan value say to INR 4 crores. So, the authors believe the calculation of the guarantee, say in a static pool, should be in terms of the disbursal made by the lender as a cohort or as a pool. Now in a revolving loan pool where the pool value is written off, further loans are added to the pool, and the calculation would be based on the cumulative disbursements. The calculation of 5% should always be in terms of the disbursements made according to the guarantee arrangements. This method will help LSPs free up more liquidity as loans get paid.\n\nThe guidelines mandate the REs to ensure the guarantee cover is specified upfront. Credit guarantees usually function under a predetermined and fixed arrangement, determined by the size of the designated pool. The entity offering the guarantee may initially deposit the entire amount with the guarantee recipient. However, when it comes to utilizing the guarantee, the recipient can only access it proportionally, depending on the number of loans that have already been disbursed.\n\nConclusion\n\nRisk is always assigned to the most capable entity, and in this case, the LSPs possess borrower-specific knowledge that qualifies them as effective bearers of risk through FLDG.\n\nThe RBI, in its WG Report, had highlighted FLDG as a grey area prohibiting REs to extend any arrangement involving such synthetic structures. It had prohibited REs to share their balance sheets to be used by unregulated entities in any form to assume credit risk. It has now after understanding the financial market's digital and technological needs given the green signal along with the much-needed guidelines on the same. \n\nAlthough there are a few uncertainties here and there, the fintech companies have welcomed the guidelines with full vigor as it provides the much-needed regulation sanctity. Unsecured personal loan and business loan lenders which currently carry an FLDG cover of above 5% and will however need to rework their arrangements. Considering the limited cap on DLG, where REs bears the majority of the loan portfolio risk, there is an incentive for them to adopt stricter credit risk assessment procedures for every borrower which could lead to the approval of loans exclusively for borrowers who satisfy these criteria. Consequently, the occurrence of loan defaults would decrease, potentially enabling REs to provide more favourable interest rates in the long run.\nFLDGRBIDigital LendingFintech\nCorporate Law\n146 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Opportunity to Public Equity Shareholders to Acquire Shares after CIRP: A Pragmatic Step?",
        "content": "Nishant Kumar\nAug 6\n6 min read\nOpportunity to Public Equity Shareholders to Acquire Shares after CIRP: A Pragmatic Step?\n[Nishant is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nThe primary aim of the insolvency and bankruptcy law is maximization of interests of all the stakeholders involved, be it creditors or debtors. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) strives to prevent unnecessary liquidation of a debtor company while keeping the interest of creditors at the centre of the whole process. It is an undeniable fact that the IBC has proved to be the harbinger of an efficient corporate regime in the country. It has been pivotal in the rescue of many distressed entities. \n\nHowever, there has been an emerging tussle between the rights of equity holders and the creditors of the entity undergoing the insolvency process. The primary concern of the equity holders is surrounded around the possibility of delisting of a company pursuant to the acceptance of resolution plan under corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). No relief is given to the equity holders in case the debtor company gets delisted after the insolvency process. Acting on these complaints and grievances, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a Framework for Protection of Interest of Public Equity Shareholders in Case of Listed Companies Undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. In this framework, SEBI has tried to address the concerns of public equity holders by giving them the opportunity to acquire shares of a new entity. \n\nConcerns of Public Equity Holders\n\nAccording to the Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules 1957 (SCRR), the minimum public shareholding (MPS) of a listed company has to be at least 25%. This means that after giving shareholding to the promoters, every listed company is required to give a minimum of 25% of shares to the public. Therefore, these public equity holders form a significant part of any listed company. \n\nAccording to the framework given by SEBI, a listed company, pursuant to the approval of a resolution plan, either remains listed or gets delisted or liquidated varying from case-to-case basis. The IBBI report suggests that 28 listed companies have ended in liquidation after failing to resolve the insolvency, 52 listed companies have been delisted after the approval of the resolution plan, and 23 companies continue to be listed pursuant to the approval of resolution plan. \n\nThe primary concern of public equity holders revolves around the companies getting delisted or liquidated after the acceptance of the resolution plan. The grievances put forward by the equity holders to SEBI were as follows: \nThe converted share of the new entity formed after the new promoters take over the old entity, pursuant to the resolution plan, should be offered to the public equity holders. \nAll small shareholders should get optimum prices for their shareholdings in the debtor company. \nThe resolution plan which erodes the value of investment of the shareholders to zero, that too without any prior intimation is inequitable and unjustifiable, jeopardizing the rights of shareholders. \nFramework by SEBI\n\nAfter getting numerous grievances from public equity holders, SEBI has attempted to address their concerns. Recently, SEBI notified a framework in which it has proposed to incorporate the interests of shareholders of the debtor company in case of delisting or liquidation of the said company. The major proposals by SEBI are listed herein below: \nPublic equity shareholders of the corporate debtor would be given an opportunity to acquire the shares of the new entity at the price ceiling agreed by the resolution applicant. Such shareholding should not cross 25%, which is the MPS percentage of a listed company.\nThe framework also mentions certain groups which are to be excluded from the above proposal of SEBI. Such group includes all the promoters, family members of promoters, associate companies and the subsidiaries, directors of the company, trusts managed by the promoters of the company among others. \nIt is mandatory that at least 5% shares of the new entity should be given to the existing public equity shareholders. In case the new entity fails to muster the 5% of existing shareholders, then the new entity would be liable to be delisted. \nThe proposal by SEBI allows public equity shareholders to participate in resolution process at the same price available to the resolution applicant.\nSEBI has formulated the proposal staying mindful of the interest of public shareholders who face uncertain future after the commencement of CIRP process against a corporate debtor. The offer to public shareholders would depend on the quantity of shares acquired by the resolution applicant pursuant to the CIRP. For instance, if the applicant acquires 100% shares of the entity, he would be liable to offer a minimum of 25% shares to public shareholders and the minimum acceptance of such shares should be 5%. The new entity would be delisted in case the acquirer shareholding is more than 95%. However, in case the acquirer’s shareholding stands at 75% or below, there would not be a need to offer any share to the public shareholders as they would automatically have the remaining 25% of the shares. \n\nThe Need for Such Proposal\nWhen a corporate debtor undergoes the CIRP, the axe always falls on the public equity holders of the company. They are at the bottom of the list when it comes to the claim on the asset of the corporate debtor. There have been several cases where the equity shareholders have suffered and their investment has plummeted to zero overnight after the application of the resolution plan approved by the committee of creditors. One such case is that of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL). In this case, after the CIRP, Piramal Capital Housing Finance Limited won the bidding and took over the DHFL, leading to the delisting of the company. This delisting wiped out thousands of equity shareholders without any consideration. In another important case of Ruchi Soya, the company was undergoing the CIRP when Patanjali Ayurveda won the bid to acquire the company. After successfully bidding for Ruchi Soya, Patanjali Ayurveda reduced the public equity shareholding to as low as 1%. The promoters of Patanjali Ayurveda almost acquired the 99% of the share. Consequently, the original shareholders of Ruchi Soya suffered a significant dent in their investment. \nThese are some of the instances which depict the precarious position of public equity shareholders when it comes to the insolvency resolution process of their concerned entities. These situations encouraged SEBI to formulate a plan which would incorporate the interest of these equity shareholders. However, whether this plan by SEBI ushers the corporate regime in the right direction is yet to be explored. \n\nValidity of the Proposal\nThe framework gives safety net to the equity shareholders who are often side-lined during the CIRP. It is in compliance with the regulations of SCRR which mandates an MPS of 25%. Also, the amendments in the SCRR notified by the SEBI state that the company that is undergoing CIRP should bring the MPS up to 25% in 3 years since such fall in the shares. Furthermore, in case the public shareholding falls below 10%, the company should strive to attain the MPS of 10% within 12 months of the fall. In any case, the MPS should be above 5% for the company to remain listed.\nHence, it can be observed that the rule for the minimum public shareholding already existed to ensure better liquidity and opportunity to trade in the stock market. SEBI, through its latest framework, has only tried to ensure that the existing shareholders should get an opportunity to be part of the minimum threshold rule.\n\nConclusion\nThe framework on the protection of interests of the public equity holder of companies undergoing the CIRP is a pragmatic step by SEBI. It safeguards the interest of shareholders of the company undergoing the CIRP. Majority of shares of a company is usually acquired by the promoters of the company. The remaining is allotted to the public shareholders. These shareholders comprise small investors who put their hard-earned money in a company with an expectation of glorious return. It also comprises veteran investors who react with the condition of market and the performance of companies in which they invest. A company undergoing insolvency proceedings can impact the decision of its investors to a significant extent. In these situations, many small investors lose their investments.\n\nThe SEBI, with its framework, has only tried to address the concern of the shareholders. The step is pragmatic and would address the issue at hand. There usually are instances where pursuant to the CIRP, the debtor company gets acquired by a different company forming a new entity or debtor company being delisted owing to a significant reduction in value. Apart from this, there have been instances when the company gets liquidated. In such cases, small investors are unlikely to get their investments back as their claim lies at the bottom of the list. It is highly inequitable for those investors who lose their earnings overnight without any opportunity of representation in front of the committee of creditors. These shareholders provide cash inflow in the company as investments play a significant role in generating finances. There is a large number of evidence showing the importance of public investments in the company, access to large capital being the most prominent one of them all. However, until now, no remedy existed in favour of public equity shareholders in case the concerned company faces insolvency proceedings. The proposed framework addresses these concerns of the small investors and, in the author’s opinion, would go a long way in supporting the investors in case their companies undergo liquidation or delisting.\nSEBIMPSSecurities RegulationCIRPIBC\nCorporate Law\n97 views\n1 like.

        "title": "IBC Overrides Electricity Act: Capturing Fallacy in Rainbow Papers",
        "content": "Praveen Sharma\nAug 5\n6 min read\nIBC Overrides Electricity Act: Capturing Fallacy in Rainbow Papers\n[Praveen is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nRecently, in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited v. Raman Ispat Private Limited and Others (Raman Ispat), the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) overrides the Electricity Act 2003. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the appeal of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), provided crucial clarification regarding the rights of creditors operating under the IBC. This clarification encompasses both secured and unsecured creditors, ensuring that they hold priority in having their debts repaid before any dues owed to the state or the Central Governments are settled. In essence, this ruling reinforces the principle of prioritizing private creditors' claims over government obligations when it comes to resolving insolvency matters.\n\nIn this post, the author argues that this judgment prudently captures the fallacy in the State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Limited (Rainbow Papers) and not only upholds the rights of creditors but also establishes a clear hierarchy in debt repayment.\n\nBackground of the Case\n\nRaman Ispat Private Limited (corporate debtor) had entered into an agreement with PVVNL for supply of electricity. A clause of the agreement provided that the outstanding dues will be a charge on the assets of the corporate debtor. This recovery mechanism was derived from Electricity Act 2003, and the regulations framed under it, including the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Supply Code 2005. Dues were unpaid by the corporate debtor from time to time, and then subsequently, PVVNL attached the properties of the corporate debtor by an order of the District Collector. After an unsuccessful resolution process, the corporate debtor went into liquidation. Liquidator contended that PVVNL’s claim would fall under Section 53 of the IBC and would be classified in order of priority under Section 53. It was contended by the liquidator that PVVNL would be entitled to pro rata distribution of proceeds along with the other secured creditors from sale of liquidation assets.\n\nThe NCLT and the NCLAT sided with the liquidator and directed the District Collector to release the property. The NCLAT upheld the NCLT’s reason that PVVNL fell within the definition of ‘operational creditor’ and should realize its dues in the liquidation process.\n\nObservations of the Supreme Court\n\nIn the appeal before the Supreme Court, PVVNL contended that Electricity Act 2003 is a ‘special enactment’ and therefore should prevail over IBC which is a ‘general law’. However, the Supreme Court held that the NCLT and the NCLAT rightfully set aside the attachment of the property of the corporate debtor and held that PVVNL can realize its dues by participating in the liquidation process as per the IBC. The Supreme Court held that Section 238 of the IBC overrides the Electricity Act 2003. The Supreme Court emphasized that the dues owed to creditors under the IBC hold a superior position compared to the electricity dues payable under the Electricity Act 2003.\n\nAnalysis of the Judgement\n\nThe Raman Ispat judgment provides a comprehensive analysis of the IBC, with special attention to the 'waterfall mechanism' stipulated in Section 53 of the IBC. Notably, the Supreme Court underlines that government debts are accorded a lower priority compared to the debts owed to unsecured financial creditors within the IBC framework. The Supreme Court's recognition of the supremacy of debts owed to unsecured financial creditors over government debts signifies a significant shift in the precedence of repayment obligations. This ruling strengthens the position of unsecured creditors and underscores the importance of honoring private financial commitments within the insolvency regime.\n\nThe Supreme Court placed significant emphasis on the 'waterfall mechanism' delineated in Section 53 of the IBC. This provision gives priority to the payment of debts to secured creditors who waive their right to enforce security when the liquidation process commences. The Supreme Court highlighted that these secured creditors, alongside the payment of workmen's dues, hold the second position in the order of repayment, right after the settlement of insolvency resolution process costs and liquidation costs. Moreover, the court pointed out that even secured creditors who choose not to waive their rights to enforce security, along with unsecured creditors, are ranked higher in the repayment scheme compared to government agencies that are owed money by the corporate debtor under Section 53 of the IBC.\n\nIn Raman Ispat judgement, the Supreme Court noted that in multiple reports leading to the creation of the IBC and in the Preamble of the IBC itself, there were consistent references to the reduction of priority for debts owed to the government. These debts encompass statutory taxes, other dues payable to the Central or the state government, as well as amounts payable into the Consolidated Fund on behalf of either government. The Supreme Court emphasized that these government-related dues should be treated distinctly and separately from the debts owed to secured creditors.\n\nRectifying Rainbow Papers Judgement\n\nWhile contending that the Electricity Act 2003 is a special enactment and thus would prevail over IBC which is a general law, PVVNL placed reliance on the Rainbow Papers judgement. PVVNL contended that the Supreme Court in Rainbow Papers determined that when a security interest is established in favor of the government for tax claims under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003, the government assumes the role of a secured creditor within the context of the IBC. In Rainbow Papers, the Supreme Court clarified that any resolution plan that omits the payment of such taxes or statutory dues owed to the government would not align with the provisions of the IBC and, consequently, would not be legally binding on the State.\n\nWhile referring to the Rainbow Papers, the Supreme Court, in Raman Ispat judgement, observed that the meticulous arrangement of Section 53 positions the amounts payable to secured creditors and workmen in the second position, just after the liquidator's costs and expenses during the liquidation process. The Supreme Court further observed that, the dues owed to the government are placed significantly lower in priority compared to secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and operational creditors. It is in this regard that the Supreme Court observed that this ‘particular design’ either went unnoticed or was not brought to the court's attention in the Rainbow Papers case. Therefore, the Supreme Court observed that the judgment failed to acknowledge the provisions of the IBC, which grant higher priority to dues payable to secured creditors over those owed to the Central or State Government.\n\nThe Supreme Court pointed out that the Rainbow Papers case overlooked the essential 'waterfall mechanism' in Section 53 of the IBC, which determines the priority of debt repayment during insolvency. This raises concerns about the judgment's thoroughness and adherence to the legislative framework. The 'waterfall mechanism' establishes a structured order of debt settlement, giving priority to insolvency resolution process costs, followed by dues to secured creditors who waive their security interest, and workmen's dues. The court's observation may impact the outcome of the Rainbow Papers case, necessitating a reevaluation considering the relevant provisions of the IBC. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Raman Ispat judgment delivered by the Supreme Court stands as a remarkable testament to well-reasoned and conceptually clear legal interpretation. By delving into the intricate details of the case, the court adeptly highlighted the overriding authority of the IBC over the Electricity Act 2003, settling any ambiguity regarding their respective applicability.\n\nOne of the pivotal aspects of the judgment was the meticulous analysis of the 'waterfall mechanism' under Section 53 of the IBC. By recognizing that government debts hold a lower priority compared to those owed to unsecured financial creditors, the court reaffirmed the significance of adhering to a structured order of debt repayment during insolvency proceedings. This observation provides a robust foundation for maintaining fairness and transparency in insolvency resolution, ensuring the equitable treatment of all stakeholders involved.\n\nMoreover, the court astutely brought attention to the incongruity in the Rainbow Papers judgment. By scrutinizing the provisions of the IBC and the hierarchy of debt repayment, the court skillfully exposed the oversight in the earlier ruling, which failed to acknowledge the distinct and lower priority given to government dues. This critical observation reinforces the need for comprehensive consideration of relevant provisions in all legal judgments to avoid potential discrepancies and uphold the principles of justice. As we look ahead, this landmark ruling will serve as a guiding light for future cases, promoting a more cohesive and equitable insolvency regime in the country.\nRainbow PapersIBCRaman IspatElectricity Act\nInsolvency Law\n133 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Beyond Abuse of Dominance: The Continued Anguish of Indian App Developers",
        "content": "Harsh\nAug 4\n7 min read\nBeyond Abuse of Dominance: The Continued Anguish of Indian App Developers\n[Harsh is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nApp developers now rely on app stores as an indispensable platform to distribute their applications to end users, with the availability of these stores directly tied to the operating system installed on smart devices. However, numerous prominent Indian app developers, including some of the most popular startups in the country, are currently confronted with the looming risk of being removed from the Google Play Store. Notably, this platform holds an overwhelming market dominance, commanding the allegiance of more than 95% of the total user base, while the market share of the Apple App Store pales in comparison at less than 4%.\n\nBrief Recapitulation \n\nIn 2005, Google acquired Android, the renowned mobile operating system. Then, in 2020, Google introduced the mandatory and exclusive utilization of the Google Play's billing system (GPBS) for processing payments related to paid app downloads and in-app purchases. Under GPBS, Google mandates that all in-app purchases go through its payment gateway and the company charges 15% to 30% commission on such purchases. In addition, Google prevents app developers from including direct links within their apps to webpages offering alternative payment methods. Restrictive covenants like these are colloquially known as “anti steering provisions.” \n\nThese developments prompted the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to initiate an investigation into the market activities of Google Asia Pacific. Following a thorough assessment, the CCI took action by imposing a penalty of INR 936.44 crore on Google for abusing its dominant position with respect to its Play Store policies. In addition to the financial penalty, the CCI also issued a cease-and-desist order, urging Google to discontinue the anti-steering provisions. \n\nGoogle’s Response: Compliance and Circumvention \n\nThe CCI order, comprising two separate mandates issued on 20 October 2022 and 25 October 2022, encompassed a comprehensive set of over two dozen recommended changes for Google to implement. Subsequently, Google introduced the \"Google Choice Billing Pilot\" during the current year. Under the framework of this alternative billing system, the service fee for such transactions shall mirror the service fee applicable to transactions facilitated by Google Play's billing system but reduced by 4%. Consequently, should the end user elect to effectuate payment through a third-party payment aggregator, the commission imposed by Google shall be diminished to a range between 11% and 26%. It is noteworthy that Google has introduced a parallel system in South Korea subsequent to a legislative approval by the National Assembly. The aforementioned legislation specifically prohibits app store operators, including Google and Apple, from compelling developers to utilize their in-app payment systems.\n\nWhile the initial reduction offered by Google may appear modest, the situation becomes direr when considering the additional burden imposed on app developers in the form of commissions payable to third-party payment aggregators. For instance, Razor Pay, a popular payment processing solution, imposes a commission of 2%, thereby resulting in a combined net payable commission of 13%-28%. Although a 2% difference in fees may have substantial implications for large-scale transactions, it is important to bear in mind that prior to 2020, Google did not claim a share of the revenue generated through in-app purchases. The only payable fee was the commission charged by payment aggregators such as Razorpay.\n\nThe Indian Startups: Google Clash\n\nThe dispute between the CCI and Google encompasses various aspects. Apart from the INR 936-crore penalty imposed by the CCI, the regulatory body has additionally imposed a fine of INR 1,337.76 crore on Google for its abuse of dominant position in multiple markets within the Android Mobile device ecosystem. Google subsequently contested this penalty at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The appellate body has upheld the Competition Commission of India's order and has now directed Google to remit 10% of the INR 1,337 crore penalty.\n\nAlthough the legal proceedings pertaining to this abuse of dominance within the Android ecosystem have attracted considerable attention and media coverage, the concurrent legal actions regarding Google's Play billing policy have not received adequate scrutiny. In the writer's view, these proceedings hold equal significance, as the forthcoming developments possess the capability to mould the entirety of the app development landscape. The subsequent paragraphs will delve into some of the pivotal advancements in this regard.\n\nMatrimony.com had filed a lawsuit challenging Google's new payment policy and sought an injunction to prevent the delisting of their app. The court found in favour of Matrimony.com and granted the interim order until 1 June 2023[1]. Consequently, The Madras High Court issued a temporary restraining order (dated 25 May 2023) against Google, preventing them from removing the mobile applications of Matrimony.com Limited, the parent company of Bharath Matrimony, from the Google Play Store. Matrimony.com argued that Google was using its monopoly power in the Android platform to enforce its payment policy, which charged service fees ranging from 11% to 26% for payments made through alternative billing systems. 7 June 2023 was decided as the next date of hearing.\n\nIn the first week of June, a number of startups, namely Unacademy, Kuku FM, TrulyMadly, and QuackQuack, filed petitions with the Madras High Court to challenge Google's notification that requires them to comply with the company's prescribed billing mechanism or face potential removal from the Play Store. These entities have joined the ranks of Matrimony.com and Shaadi.com, which have previously approached the high court to contest Google's billing policies and request legal remedy. As the legal battle between Google and Indian startups unfolds, the Madras High Court delivered a mixed bag of news for the tech giant. On one hand, the court instructed startups to provide a report on their June download figures to Google and pay a 4% commission to the search giant. On the other hand, the court issued an extended interim injunction, prohibiting Google from removing any companies that have filed petitions against it from the Play Store. \n\nHybrid Jurisdiction Clause\n\nAnother aspect that has received scant coverage is the imposition of what is commonly referred to as an \"optional\" or \"hybrid\" jurisdiction clause by Google on app developers seeking to publish their apps on the Play Store. Under the terms of the mandatory \"Developer Distribution Agreement\", developers are compelled to waive their right to pursue legal action in Indian courts and instead must exclusively seek resolution in the United States court located in Santa Clara, California, should any disputes arise. Notably, Google reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings in Indian courts at its convenience, thereby giving rise to these clauses being labelled as \"unilateral jurisdictional clauses.\" The legality of such a clause under the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Contract Act) and the Competition Act 2002 constitutes a contentious issue in the ongoing dispute between Google and the startups.\n\nCommon law jurisdictions demonstrate a consistent trend favoring the validity of unilateral clauses. English courts have long embraced these clauses, emphasized the importance of party autonomy and asserted that granting one party a positional advantage does not invalidate the clause. Recent cases, such as Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Hestia Holdings Ltd., further reinforce this position. While concerns exist regarding the applicability of unilateral clauses in consumer contracts, there is a belief that their validity should not be dismissed solely based on the party's identity. Similarly, in the United States and Australia, while no settled case law invalidates unilateral clauses, questions have arisen in imbalanced agreements, such as employment contracts, regarding the legality of certain jurisdiction options. Nevertheless, the High Court of Australia, in PMT Partners Pty. Ltd. (In Liq.) v. Australian National Parks & Wildlife Service, upheld a unilateral clause, recognizing the parties' right to choose between arbitration and litigation.\n\nContinental jurisdictions present a more diverse landscape in interpreting unilateral clauses. German law generally upholds their validity, but German courts have invalidated certain clauses on the grounds of unfairness, particularly when significant imbalances exist, favoring only one party. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the asymmetric position of the parties, as the party with a state forum option may face counter-actions invoking arbitration. In Italy, both older and more recent case laws lean toward favoring unilateral clauses, confirming their validity within the jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal of Madrid, Spain, recently reviewed a unilateral clause and reaffirmed its effectiveness, citing party autonomy and justifying the combination of arbitration and court litigation options. However, in certain jurisdictions such as France, Russia, Bulgaria, Poland, and China, a different approach to unilateral clauses has been observed, introducing an element of unpredictability. \n\nUnderstanding India's Judicial Stance: The Path Ahead\n\nThe current state of hybrid jurisdiction clauses in India remains uncertain due to conflicting rulings by the judiciary. There is no clarity on the enforceability of such clauses. However, it is essential to consider that Indian courts prioritize the avoidance of injustice. In situations where enforcing an asymmetric jurisdiction clause would lead to unfairness or clear injustice due to exceptional circumstances and unforeseen factors, courts may choose not to uphold the clause. \n\nIndian courts firmly acknowledge the concept of forum non conveniens, which allows them to decline jurisdiction if they determine that they are not the appropriate forum for a cross-border dispute. The response of an Indian court may differ if a party initiates litigation that contradicts a choice-of-forum clause selecting a foreign court. In such instances, the Indian court may assume jurisdiction over the case if the party can demonstrate extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances that would cause great injustice if the chosen forum were respected. Conversely, if the Indian court determines that the proceedings in India are oppressive, vexatious, or merely an attempt to undermine the choice of forum clause, or if the designated forum is considered appropriate considering the convenience of the parties, the Indian court may suspend or terminate the proceedings.\n\nThe Madras High Court's decision to refrain from outright rejecting the claims asserted by the Indian app developers solely based on the exclusive jurisdiction clause within the contract is a favorable indication. The imposition of a requirement upon Indian app developers to pursue litigation before a court situated in California, a jurisdiction housing the Google headquarters commonly known as \"Google Park,\" would undeniably impose severe inconvenience upon Indian startups. Moreover, it is pertinent to note that the subject matter at hand transcends a mere antitrust concern, as it entails intricate considerations encompassing the Contract Act, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, and the alleged violation of guidelines formulated by the Reserve Bank of India, among other factors. The assessment of the validity of the asymmetric jurisdiction clause in light of Sections 27 and 28 of the Contract Act remains among the numerous inquiries that the Indian startups anxiously yearn for resolution. The potential implications upon the constitutionally safeguarded fundamental right of trade and commerce, as enshrined within Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, may also emerge as a pivotal subject to be addressed before the courts in the imminent months. In conclusion, the matter continues to evolve, garnering vigilant observation from all stakeholders and scholars within the field.\n[1] Matrimony.Com Ltd v Alphabet Inc and Ors., (O.A.No.366 of 2023 in C.S (COMM DIV) No.98 of 2022)\nCompetitionCompetition ActAbuse of DominanceCCIGoogle Play\nCompetition Law\n116 views\n3 likes.

        "content": "Ghazal Bhootra\nAug 3\n6 min read\nRights, Camera, Action: Role of Amicus Curiae in Representing Local Communities in ISDS Proceedings\n[Ghazal is a student at Kirit P Mehta School of Law, SVKM's NMIMS (Deemed-to-be-University).]\n\nAssociating human rights with business is not a novel idea. The need for Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) reforms in the business and human rights sphere has been inducing changes in the workings of many tribunals. Issues such as a foreign investor's business being involved in human rights violations against local populations are often a source of criticism of ISDS as it does not allow third parties like indigenous communities to participate even when their human rights are in question. \n\nHowever, amicus curiae submissions are seen as a method to overcome such criticism. While much has been said on the topic of amicus curiae submissions in investment arbitration, this article, through the lens of recent cases and the ICSID Arbitration Rules 2022, attempts to answer an unconventional question. Are amicus curiae enough to protect human rights of local communities in investment arbitration? \n\nAmicus Curiae in Investment Arbitration\n\nArbitrators over the past two decades have shown a greater willingness to include third parties in investment arbitration. 97 claims of amicus curiae have been filed since 2003 before different arbitral tribunals (some being based on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and some being non-NAFTA). The arbitral tribunals decided to accept 59 of them in whole, approve 4 in part, and deny 34 of them. \n\nEarlier, Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules 2006 used to govern submissions from non-disputing parties. The Tribunal, according to the rule, has to consider whether the non-party’s submission “(i) would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties; (ii) the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute; or (iii) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding.” The Tribunal also had to make sure that “the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.”\n\nThe ICSID Arbitration Rules 2006 were updated in 2022, and now Rule 67 governs submissions by non-disputing parties. It has added 2 more conditions in addition to the previous three that the tribunal has to give heed to. These are – “(i) the identity, activities, organization and ownership of the non-disputing party, including any direct or indirect affiliation between the non-disputing party, a party or a non-disputing Treaty Party; and (ii) whether any person or entity will provide the non-disputing party with financial or other assistance to file the submission”.\n\nBorder Timbers v. Zimbabwe\n\nIn the past, only 2 cases have involved an application by local communities themselves to be included as non-parties, out of which is Glamis Gold v. USA, where the application was approved, and the other is Border Timbers Limited and Others v. Zimbabwe (Border Timbers), where the same was rejected. The arbitrators in the Border Timbers case pointed out the thin line that exists in the framework of Rule 37(2) where a non-disputing party must be independent but also possess significant interest in the proceedings. \n\nThe indigenous communities had alleged that the company violated their human rights and had historical access to the land, hence they had significant interest. However, their application was rejected on ground of non-independence. This was because the chief of these communities was selected by the President of Zimbabwe. However, the Tribunal also agreed that the proceedings would impact interests of these communities but due to the framework of Rule 37(2) they could not be allowed to make submissions.\n\nIt is pertinent to also note that the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights had also applied together with the communities to be amicus curiae. They argued that “[t]hese issues are also of significant public interest beyond the present dispute, to other indigenous communities and individuals living in areas potentially affected by foreign investments, to investors and governments, in Zimbabwe and elsewhere.” They also pointed out that amicus curiae submissions were the sole possibility for affected communities to be heard in arbitration. However, the tribunal put human rights completely out of the scope of the arbitration, and hence rejected the application. \n\nGran Columbia Gold v. Colombia\n\nIn the more recent case of Gran Colombia Gold Corp. v. Republic of Columbia, “El Cogote”, an association of miners applied to be amicus curiae. The company alleged illegal mining activity which prejudiced their exclusive mining licenses issued by the state. The association wished to shed light on the manifestations of the local miners, precautionary measure resolution by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, corruption in acquisition of the license, violation of their collective rights and the difference between illegal and traditional mining among other things. The Tribunal did not allow submissions on violation of collective rights as that was out of their scope.\n Interestingly, the Tribunal addresses the same dilemma that the arbitrators had in Border Timbers. Here it notes that for a party to be independent, does not have to mean that they had no role in the events making up the factual matrix, as that would hold the condition of having significant interest and particular knowledge ‘nugatory’.  Therefore, the tribunal accepted the submissions but limited to the topics of the corruption in acquiring license, manifestations of the miners and the resolution of the Inter-American Commission on human rights. Again, the collective rights for the local communities were out of the scope of the arbitration.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nIncreasingly, it is evident that stakeholders to investment arbitrations find it costly to disregard human rights. Human rights standards are now being explicitly integrated into the latest generation of bilateral agreements, human rights jurisprudence continues to be utilised to support understanding of investment law, as well as in a growing proportion of cases, human rights can serve as the basis for a claim or counterclaim.\n\nHowever, tribunals are still putting human rights and collective rights of local population out of the scope of the arbitration, as seen in the above cases. The bigger issue also lies in the framework of submissions by an amicus curiae. The dichotomy between the need for significant interest and the independence of the non-disputing party is significantly worsening the situation for communities affected by investors. Unless the parties themselves put in the issue of human rights abuses during the proceedings, the submission of amicus curiae is unacceptable, therefore limiting their scope and application. Even if allowed, their submissions are limited, and they are not provided any access to documents of the hearing. There is a dire need to distinguish between the involvement of “affected persons” (local communities) and “concerned persons” (amicus curiae).\n\nIt is undeniable that these changes are part of a larger progression in the vulnerability of companies to human rights-based contentions, that can be seen also in the December 2019 launch of the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration. \n\nPreviously, Odumosu, Laryea, and Perrone have advocated for the involvement of local communities in Investor state arbitration hearings. Perrone and Laryea argue for an explicit involvement in the proceedings, whereas Odumosu contends that participating does not inherently imply a formal (direct) status of participation in the hearings. The Hague Rules suggest that a new business and human rights arbitration framework could be set up. However, as Ogunranti argues, reforming the ICSID rules could be just as effective and would avoid the backlash and legitimacy concerns of an untested arbitration process.\n\nWhile it was expected that the ICSID Arbitration Rules 2022 would be beneficial to the cause of local populations, it has not been up to the mark. It only includes two other categories for the consideration of the tribunal when accessing an application. As a local community participant noted in a United Nations’ round table discussion, “if you believe amicus works, that is false.”\n\nIn 2007, United Nations adopted the landmark United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It recognises their right to self-determination, which however still is contentious in practice. An important right that is also provided for in Article 10 is the right to free, prior, and informed consent when taking over land and property of the local communities. It is widely unrecognised in international investment agreements. The World Bank has also tried to draft guidelines with respect to the framework for inclusion in projects they fund. At present, however, human rights for local communities are largely ignored in investment treaties and arbitration. Anaya and Puig are of the opinion that IIAs “provide extensive protections to foreign investors without the adequate policy and regulatory space to ensure the protection of human rights”. Therefore, a wider accessibility to local communities and parties affected by the investor’s decisions guaranteed using the FPIC framework and clauses on community rights in IIAs and ICSID rules could be a step in the direction of solving the legitimacy crisis of investor state arbitration.\nArbitrationInvestment ArbitrationAmicus CuriaeICSIDISDS\nDispute Resolution\n81 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Requirement of Notice of Arbitration: Mere Technicality or Sine Qua Non?",
        "content": "Archisman Chatterjee, Sanidhya Somvanshee\nJul 31\n6 min read\nRequirement of Notice of Arbitration: Mere Technicality or Sine Qua Non?\n[Archisman and Sanidhya are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe Delhi High Court in Rahul Jain v. Atul Jain recently held that initiating an arbitration process requires issuing a notice of arbitration initiating. Justice Prateek Jalan, who delivered the judgement, emphasised that the party the arbitration has an obligation to serve the other party with a written notice expressing its intention to refer the dispute to arbitration, as mandated by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act).\n\nThis notice helps the receiving party gain the advantage of understanding the claims made and is able to narrow down the dispute by deciding whether to accept or reject the claims. Additionally, the notice under Section 21 of the Act serves an important purpose in arbitration proceedings. This notice clarifies claims, identifies potential defenses, outlines the arbitration procedure, facilitates consensus on arbitrator appointment, and triggers court jurisdiction in case of non-compliance. Due to irreconcilable judgments, it has been a matter of judicial conundrum whether its performance is absolutely critical or whether substituted performance can override it. \n\nIn this article, we discuss the nature of the requirement of notice of arbitration as to whether serving it is compulsory or a mere technical requirement. Primarily, we delve into discussing the differing judicial opinions rendered by the courts. Secondly, we analyze the relevant issue by relating it to certain basic principles of the Civil Procedure Code 1908 (CPC) and scope the importance of issuing notice as part of new updates after proceedings have started. Lastly, we compare the procedure followed in foreign jurisdictions and that the Indian practice concerning the issue in question.\n\nConflicting Judicial Opinions\n\nEarlier in 2017, the Delhi high court, in a landmark judgement in Alupro Buildings v. Ozone (Alupro), accorded a similar interpretation to the need to provide a notice. In that case, the court delved into the main object and purpose of Section 21 of the Act in order to declare it as mandatory in nature. The court reasoned that the notice formed an essential primary step in commencing the arbitration process between the parties. Thus, it appears to us from the ruling of the court that any proceedings started without fulfilling the prerequisite criteria under Section 21 of the Act would be invalid in law. \n\nOn similar lines, the Madras High Court, in Globe Detective v. Gammon, held that the notice under Section 21 is of paramount importance since it facilitates a consensus on the appointment of an arbitrator. The court concluded that issuing the notice would be mandatory to initiate the arbitration unless a contrary intention is established validly. However, the case of Kailesh v. Aaren saw a different ruling which gives greater importance on the need to issue a notice. It held that treating the non-compliance of the notice as a mere irregularity and overriding its requirement is possible if the other party does not object to it before the arbitrator.\n\nThe Delhi High Court once again in De Lagen v. Parhit (Lagen) issued a different ruling that deviates from the stance taken in Alupro. The court reasoned that if the defendant is already aware of the arbitration proceedings either by notice or other routes, then Section 21 takes the nature of a mere formality. Once the notice achieves its intended purpose, fulfilling its compliance becomes optional. Herein, we argue that the court's approach was less restrictive and diverged significantly from the other judgments, potentially leading to confusion and a lack of uniformity in interpreting the provision.\n\nStrict Procedural Necessity\n\nThe SC, in a number of judgments, settled the law that adherence to every procedure in CPC should not cause injustice. Provisions of arbitration law will always take precedence over CPC, but the principles of CPC in line with the Act and not explicitly ousted ought to be incorporated in it. In DP v. Vishvaraj (DP), the court held that service of a mere legal notice and from whose contents the invocation of arbitration can be inferred, would lead to the wavering of the requirement of Section 21. This ruling, along with the one in Lagen, shows that the court took a more relaxed approach while interpreting the provision. \n\nAs it appears to us from Lagen and DP, on the satisfaction of the objective and purpose behind giving notice to the other party, albeit in an implied and indirect manner that is not wholly compliant with Section 21, the need to serve it becomes discretionary. The authors argue that heavily relying on compliance with procedural requirements can hamper party's interests since arbitration is inherently a consent-driven process. Denial of setting up an arbitral tribunal due to the absence of notice runs wholly opposite to the pro-arbitration approach of Indian courts. The principles of CPC can act as guideposts for courts to interpret the degree of necessity of giving notice by striking a balancing act between the purpose of the provision and the deleterious effect it would have on the party who failed to give notice but conveyed its initiation.\n\nPost Commencement Notice\n\nArbitration considers certain events to be critical, to the extent that such events are almost equivalent to the re-commencement of proceedings. For instance, on the death of the arbitrator or the termination of their mandate, proceedings can resume only after the appointment of substitute arbitration. This leads to the question as to whether its continuance becomes contingent on the serving of a fresh notice. The Jharkhand High Court in Central Coalfields v. Powertech opined that if and when a substitute arbitrator is to be appointed during the proceedings, there is no requirement incumbent upon the parties to issue a fresh notice. \n\nHowever, in this judgement, since the respondent (Powertech) failed to act on the initial notice, the High Court appointed an arbitrator based on an application under Section 11(6) of the Act. It appears that the court removed the need to issue another notice since the respondent failed to act on the first notice. We argue that this approach of the court places more reliance on the specific facts of the case by considering the past acts of the parties. Contrary to that, Section 21 specifically mentions that the proceedings “commence” on the date the notice is given and is completely silent on the event of recommencement. Herein, a verdict from the apex court could provide the much-needed clarity by deciding on the more beneficial approach. \n\nForeign Jurisprudence \n\nThe Arbitration Act 1996 governs the UK's arbitration and requires a party to serve a notice if they wish to initiate arbitral proceedings. A comprehensive reading of the statute indicates that if the arbitrator is named or designated in the arbitration agreement, one party can initiate proceedings by serving a notice requiring submission to the named arbitrator. On the same lines, Article 3 of UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules also states the mandatory requirement of serving an arbitration notice. In Glencore Agriculture v. Conqueror Holdings, it was held that the service of notice and the compliance with the institutional rules is important to avoid challenges to the validity of the award. \n\nThe UNCITRAL rules comprehensively discuss the notice of arbitration, covering various aspects including the timeframe within which the respondent has to send out his communication to the claimant. The rules emphasise that the respondent's failure to respond to the arbitration notice should not hinder the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. In contrast, the arbitration law in India takes a simpler approach regarding service of notice and does not delve into the specifics of its content or the subsequent response. This disparity highlights the differing approaches these two legal frameworks take in addressing the notice requirements in arbitration proceedings.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe authors argue that the provision of serving the arbitration notice is crucial for communicating the initiation of arbitration to the other party. It also sets the ground for the start of arbitration proceedings. On the other hand, if someone fulfils the purpose of service of notice in some other valid way, then insisting on its mandatory nature could create unnecessary delays in the proceedings, which will cause inconvenience to the parties. This effect would be in complete contravention of pro-arbitration approach advocated by the apex court and would hinder the object of the law i.e., fast and efficient resolution of disputes. In light of this, the authors suggest that a clear interpretation bestowed upon this issue by the Supreme Court has the potential to adequately address it. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nTo sum it up, the arbitration notice is an essential, if not mandatory, requirement for initiating the arbitration process. The language of the statute showcases its extremely important role in the entire process while leaving the determination of its nature up to interpretation. Despite the conclusion that service of notice of arbitration is not a mere formality according to some courts, conflicting judicial opinions have held it to be a mere technical requirement. However, in light of the underlying principles of CPC, if too great an emphasis is placed on its completion, it could hamper party's interests by preventing them from participating in the arbitration process in a timely manner. Thus, striking the right balance between procedural compliance with a statute and fulfilment of its intent and object through a purposive approach should be of prime consideration.\nArbitration and ConciliationNoticeArbitration\nDispute Resolution\n134 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "VB Rangaraj Judgment and its Impact on Shareholder Agreements Regarding Transferability of Shares",
        "content": "Aditya Krishnan\nJul 29\n5 min read\nVB Rangaraj Judgment and its Impact on Shareholder Agreements Regarding Transferability of Shares\n[Aditya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe legal position of contractual restrictions on the transfer of shares has differed in several judgments, leading to an unsatisfactory position in Indian law. This contention has arisen due to the interpretation of whether the same is violative of the phrase “freely transferable” in case of public and private companies under the erstwhile Section 111A (2) of the Companies Act 1956 (CA 1956) and Section 58(2) of the current Companies Act 2013 (CA 2013), and whether such a transfer must be in consonance with the company’s articles.\n\nThe Rangaraj Judgment\n\nJustice Sawant observed in VB Rangaraj v VB Gopalakrishnan (Rangaraj) that a private agreement that imposes a restriction on the transfer of shares that is not in consonance with the Articles of Association is “neither binding on the shareholders, nor on the company.” While the position that such agreements are not binding on the company is well established in English law, the court’s stance on the applicability of the same to shareholders is extremely peculiar. The only possible statutory provision that supported such a statement was Section 82 of CA 1956, which classified shares of a company to be moveable property, “transferable in the manner provided by the Articles of Association.”\n\nThe legislative history of this section can be traced back to Section 73(1) of the English Companies Act, which was extremely similar to that of its colonial predecessor in phraseology except for the phrase “moveable property” contained in place of “personal estate.”\n\nDuring this time, the Board of Directors (BoD) of a company, by no statutory provision, had the ability to refuse the transfer of shares, and hence, the authority for such recourse by the BoD was to be found within the Articles of Association. Such a view was affirmed across English judgments, case in point being Re Cawley & Co, wherein the Lordships observed that the share transfer amongst shareholders is subject to the articles, indicating that “the board cannot, except in accordance with the articles, impose any restriction on the ability of a shareholder to transfer.” (emphasis supplied). Hence, the phrase “transferable in the manner” was only limited to the extent of the BoD and did not extend to contracting parties. J Radhakrishnan was hence of the view that the Rangaraj case may have been wrongly decided because it imposes a fetter on the freedom of the parties to enter into contract although no such fetter is found in CA 1956, in the Vodafone International Holdings v. Union of India case. \n\nThe consequences of such a decision had its bearing in the cases of Mafatlal Industries Limited v. Gujarat Gas (Mafatlal) and Pushpa Katoch v. Manu Maharani Hotels (Pushpa Katoch). By this time, Section 111 of CA 1956 had undergone a change by means of an amendment in 1996, wherein Section 111 was amended to be applicable only to private companies, and Section 111A was inserted in lieu of public companies. The key difference in this categorisation was that in the case of public companies, Section 111A(2) went to the extent of stating that their shares were “freely transferable”, while the principle established in Rangaraj remained the same with respect to Section 82 of CA 1956. However, this had no bearing on the courts in the cases of Pushpa Katoch and Mafatlal, where it was observed that “any restriction contained in the Articles that prohibits the transfer of shares would be null and void” (emphasis supplied) and that “The ratio in Rangaraj must be accepted with greater force in the case of a public limited company.” '\n\nThe decision by the division bench in Messer Holdings v. Shyam Madanmohan Ruia (Messer) was finally a welcome change, as Khanwilkar J rightly observed that the phrase “freely transferable” in Section 111A(2) only meant that “the seller and buyer both, must agree to the terms of sale” and did not imply that a shareholder cannot enter into a contractual agreement with another shareholder, or a third party, in relation to his specific shares. Furthermore, if a company wanted to prohibit such a right of the shareholders, it could only do so through means of an express condition barring the same in the Articles of Association. Hence, while the case did not expressly overrule the Rangaraj judgment, it made a distinction from it in the sense that the former stated that a restriction on the transfer of shares is \"enforceable unless contained\" in the articles, while the latter held that the same is \"enforceable unless barred\" by the articles. \n Section 58(2): An Imperfect Solution? \n\nSince there certainly exists a legal grey area between the positions in Rangaraj and Messer, there is a dire need for a legislative solution that addresses the two issues. Firstly, an agreement between two shareholders cannot be deemed to be ineffective just because it is not contained in the articles, and secondly, the phrase “freely transferable” does not bar the validity of contractual agreements.\n\nThe current legislative framework under Section 58(2) of CA 2013 fails to address the former and only partially achieves the latter. Sub-section (1) of Section 58 of CA 2013 expressly pertains to only private companies, while sub-section (2) begins with the phrase \"without prejudice to sub-section (1)\" and goes on to state that the securities in a public company are freely transferrable. Hence, although the proviso in Section 58(2) may result in safeguarding contractual arrangements in public companies pertaining to the transferability of shares, such a scenario has still not been clarified in case of private companies. The legislature has still left room for ambiguity by retaining the principle of Section 82 of CA 1956, now Section 44 of CA 2013, and has refrained from reversing the principle laid down in the Rangaraj case.\n\nIn future cases, there may be uncertainty as to whether a contractual restriction on the shares of any company is ineffective unless it is included in the articles of association, or whether such a restriction on the shares of a public company is enforceable \"as a contract\" under the proviso to Section 58(2), but the same restriction on the shares of a private company is unenforceable even as a matter of contract. If the former view is adopted, as done so in Pushpa Katoch and Mafatlal, the proviso to Section 58(2) would serve as a dead letter. However, if the latter is adopted, a constitutional challenge would arise because of the proviso, in the sense that an inherent discrimination would exist between a public company and a private company, and that there exists no rational nexus between the categorisation resulting from Section 58(2) and the object of the legislation. \n\nCurrently, a Special Leave Petition challenging the Bombay High Court's ruling in Messer is ongoing before the Supreme Court of India. Coupled with this, the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court’s decision in Bajaj Auto Limited v. Western Maharashtra Development reaffirming that “preemptive rights cannot be interpreted to be a violation of the phrase ‘freely transferrable’\" is a right step in this direction.\n\nGiven the fact that the solution proposed by the legislature in CA 2013 is not substantial and takes the law to another thicket, it is left to the courts to perhaps modify the Rangaraj rule once and for all. \nCompanies ActFreely TransferableSection 58(2)RangarajMesser Holdings\nCorporate Law\n268 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Will Deal Value Thresholds Kill the Threat of Killer Acquisitions?",
        "content": "Milind Khemka\nJul 28\n5 min read\nWill Deal Value Thresholds Kill the Threat of Killer Acquisitions?\n[Milind is a student at National Law University Delhi.]\n\nThe Competition (Amendment) Bill 2020 (Bill) has received an approval from both houses without any debate or discussion. The Bill is the Parliament’s attempt to give life to the suggestions made by the Competition Law Review Committee (Committee) in its 2019 report. One of the key features of the Bill is the introduction of deal or transaction value thresholds for the notification of combinations. Any combination that exceeds a deal value of INR 2,000 crores will have to be notified to the CCI. Previously, notification was only mandated based on turnover / assets of the combining parties. These new thresholds were recommended by the Committee with the aim of trapping ‘killer acquisitions’ within the purview of the CCI. Killer acquisitions are those acquisitions aimed at removing a nascent but threatening competitor from the market and is especially common among big tech companies. In the digital sector, it is common for startups that provide innovative technologies to be focused on amassing a user base rather than maximizing their turnover. Thus, they do not fall under the notification requirement under the Competition Act 2002 (Act). These firms are offered lucrative deals by dominant players in the market that are both willing and able to pay extraordinary amounts to maintain their dominance in the market. These types of transactions have gone under the CCI’s radar time and again. The acquisitions of Myntra by Flipkart, TaxiforSure by Ola, WhatsApp by Facebook, and Freecharge by Snapdeal are some examples given by the Committee in its report. Deal value thresholds have been implemented by some other jurisdictions, e.g. USA, Canada and Germany. However, in the Indian context, such a change would be incomplete without also reviewing the CCI’s power to take cognizance of non-notifiable transactions. \n\nCan CCI Do Anything About Transactions That Do Not Trigger Thresholds?\n\nThe Bill has selectively implemented the Committee report by introducing deal value thresholds, but not extending the power of the CCI to go beyond those thresholds. The CCI does not have any ability to investigate a combination that does not meet their notification requirements. This is why the aforementioned combinations were able to fly under the CCI’s nose. Even if the CCI believes a merger will have an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC), its hands are tied unless it is notified of the combination. In the EU, when the infamous Facebook / WhatsApp merger did not meet their turnover thresholds, the EC was able to review the merger due to its referral system. The lack of any such mechanism in the statutory framework for antitrust law in India puts it in a precarious position where it cannot afford to have any false negatives arising from its threshold requirements. \n\nFalse Positives v/s False Negatives: The Lesser Evil\n\nWith any kind of an numerical threshold requirement, there will be some false positives and false negatives. Some combinations that triggered the notification requirement unnecessarily, and some that did not trigger the requirement when they should have. No threshold can be perfect, such that it catches all and only anti-competitive combinations. India cannot afford to have false negatives, since the CCI can take no ex ante measures against such transactions. It is only once the combination goes through and the anti-competitive effects start manifesting in the market, that the CCI will be able to take action. By this stage, irreversible harm may be made to the market. \n\nCan CCI Really Afford Either?\n\nWhile setting the value of the threshold requirement, the legislators are faced with a trade-off. If they set a high number, they maximize false negatives and minimize false positives and vice versa. The only apparent choice with the CCI seems to be to set the requirement so low that it almost guarantees no false negatives, but on the other hand, maximizes false positives. Keeping a low threshold for transaction value would mean the CCI has to conduct at least Phase 1 investigations on unnecessary transactions, which is incongruent with the legislative intent. The Bill aims to reduce the overall time taken for Phase 1 and Phase 2 investigations. The Chicago school of antitrust thought argues that false positives come with a higher social cost than false negatives due to the self-correcting nature of the market. The argument is a false negative may allow some firms to reap monopolistic profits, such profits would attract more entrants into the market and the market would self-correct over time. The point is that fixing an arbitrary threshold forces legislators a dichotomy where neither option is acceptable. An option for the CCI seems to be to keep a high deal value threshold while empowering the CCI to investigate non-notifiable mergers. This would help minimize both false positives and negatives. Alternatively, the EU has adopted an approach that does not restrict the Competition Authority to an arbitrary threshold value. The EU has introduced the Digital Markets Act (Regulation 2022/1925) (DMA) and the Digital Services Act Regulation 2022/2065, that use a ‘gatekeeper method’ to keep a watch on the dominant players in the market.  \n\nLessons From the EU\n\nThe EU has adopted a gatekeeper approach, where they identify certain ‘gatekeepers’ in the market. There are some objective criteria for a firm to be labelled a gatekeeper, these are listed in Article 3(1) of the DMA. While the DMA has a much wider ambit, in the context of merger control, it introduces a notification requirement for such gatekeepers. Gatekeepers must notify the competition authority about any acquisitions. This should be beneficial in handling killer acquisitions in particular since these are predatory acquisitions by large tech firms in particular. What is interesting about this approach is the lack of a threshold and thus not being forced to choose between false positives and false negatives. Such a provision can be introduced in consonance with, if not as a replacement for the deal value thresholds. There should be lenient requirements for a firm to be termed a gatekeeper, and the final decision should lie with the CCI. The CCI is a body of experts that should be trusted with greater discretionary power like its global counterparts. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the deal value thresholds are a welcome change and are in line with international practices of advanced jurisdictions, the strict adherence to such a threshold system is particularly dangerous for the CCI. Unlike the EU, the CCI has no referral system or any mechanism for it to review non-notifiable mergers. This only leaves the law makers with one option, that is to set low thresholds that envelope all anti-competitive combinations within its ambit, which would lead to a lot of false positives and add to the regulatory burden of the CCI. The CCI is a body of experts and should not be limited by the thresholds set by Parliament. Greater discretionary power should be given to the CCI so it can act when needed, and refrain when it is not. It should not be forced to investigate all combinations that meet a straightjacket threshold, and combinations should not be completely immune from scrutiny by simply not meeting a threshold. The determination of AAEC is based on a number of factors and the impact of a combination cannot be assessed based on any one indicator, be it turnover or deal value. The CCI should decide which mergers it wants to review and which it does not based on a mélange of reasons such as barriers to entry, existing competitors, maturity of the market, etc. It is time for the CCI to break out of the arbitrary limits on its jurisdiction imposed on it by the Parliament for a more successful antitrust regime in India. \nCCICompetition ActCompetition (Amendment) Bill 2020Deal Value Threshold\nCompetition Law\n139 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Threads by Meta: Navigating the Competitive Landscape and Antitrust Concerns",
        "content": "Utkarsh Sharma\nJul 28\n4 min read\nThreads by Meta: Navigating the Competitive Landscape and Antitrust Concerns\n[Utkarsh is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nThreads, a recently launched application by Meta on 6 July 2023, has emerged as a formidable competitor to the social media giant Twitter. Twitter has faced widespread criticism from users due to its capricious policies, particularly since its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk. Despite Musk's announcement of a new CEO for the platform, his radical measures for Twitter, from the introduction of a policy limiting verified accounts to reading 6000 posts per day with similar restrictions of 600 and 300 posts for unverified and new verified accounts, respectively, have raised concerns. Against the backdrop of these substantial policy changes, the introduction of the Threads platform by Meta offers a potential alternative to Twitter. Notably, Threads experienced remarkable success, amassing 10 million sign-ups within a mere 7 hours of its launch.\n\nThe terms and conditions published by Meta for the usage of Threads raises significant concerns for competition law enforcement agencies worldwide. Three major issues are likely to come under scrutiny. First, there is the potential abuse of Meta's dominant position in one relevant market to enter another relevant market. Second, the network effects enjoyed by Meta could lead to the denial of market access for the competitors. Lastly, concerns may arise regarding the tying of products. These concerns gain weight from the terms and conditions published by Meta for its users.\n\nLeveraging Dominant Position\n\nPrimarily, the utilization of Threads requires users to possess an Instagram account, thus making it essential to have an Instagram account in order to access the Threads platform. Section 4(2)(e) of the Competition Act 2002 (Act) stipulates that when an enterprise exploits its dominant position in one relevant market to enter or safeguard other relevant markets, it constitutes an abuse of the dominant position by said enterprise. It is noteworthy that when Facebook acquired Instagram, it was regarded as a \"photo-sharing app\", but it is now apparent that Facebook and Instagram are direct rivals, both under the ownership of Meta. Similarly, although Threads may exhibit dissimilarities with Twitter, it will still fall within the same relevant market as Twitter since the fundamental nature of the content on both platforms is textual in form.\n\nIn numerous jurisdictions such as Germany, Meta is already facing charges for abusing its dominant position in the market. It is no secret that Meta holds a dominant position in the social media market, with its major platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Thus, two conclusions can be drawn: Threads will operate within the same relevant market as Twitter, and Meta enjoys a dominant position in the relevant market of social media platforms. The policy enforced by Meta, which mandates the creation of an Instagram account to access Threads, exemplifies how Meta leverages its dominant position in one relevant market to enter another relevant market.\n\nIt could be argued that Twitter itself, as a social media giant, holds a dominant position in the relevant market, while Threads is far from attaining a dominant position that surpasses Twitter. However, the data comparing the user base of Twitter (over 350 million users) and Threads (less than 15 million users) is irrelevant to our discussion. What matters is the dominant position held by Meta, not Threads. The authorities in their rulings in National Stock Exchange of India Limited v. Competition Commission of India and Shri Shamsher Kataria v. Honda Seil Cars Limited and Others have determined that the dominant player in the first relevant market does not necessarily need to possess a dominant position in the second relevant market when attempting to leverage its position in the first relevant market to enter the second relevant market. The CCI has adopted a strict approach in such cases, going as far as stating that a high degree of associational link between the two relevant markets is not necessary (emphasis supplied). The CCI has clarified in the aforementioned cases that the enterprise abusing its dominant position in the second market warrants a separate investigation. However, the fact that the enterprise has exploited its dominant position in the first relevant market to enter another relevant market itself constitutes an abuse under the Act. Meta may argue that the requirement of an Instagram account for using Threads is solely for initial traction, but this argument does not negate the charge of abusing a dominant position under Section 4(2)(e) of the Act.\n\nAbusing the Network Effects\n\nThe second concern pertains to the network effects enjoyed by Meta. Users who access Threads are required to have an existing Instagram account, as stipulated in the terms of agreement published by Meta for Threads usage. Deleting the Threads profile and data necessitates the deletion of the user's Instagram account, highlighting the power wielded by Meta due to network effects. This network effect also acts as a barrier to market access for new entrants since users can only utilize Threads by creating an account on the platform. Such practices are in violation of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act.\n\nTying Products and Services\n\nFurthermore, the policy mandating users to sign up on Instagram in order to use Threads contravenes Section 4(2)(d) of the Act, which states that it is unlawful to subject the conclusion of contracts to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations that lack connection to the subject of such contracts, as determined by their nature or commercial usage. If a user desires to use Threads, they are compelled to create an Instagram account, an obligation that is not an industry practice. Notably, Meta owns both WhatsApp and Facebook, but there is no requirement for users to have an Instagram account to access these platforms. Users are granted the freedom to sign up through their phone numbers or email IDs. Similarly, users are not obliged to sign up on any other platform to create a Twitter account. Therefore, this compulsion lacks any connection or commercial usage.\n\nConclusion\n\nTech giant Google has alleged that the CCI has unscrupulously replicated steps taken by other jurisdictions to maintain competition. While there may be some truth to this claim, it is crucial for the CCI to play a proactive role when necessary rather than relying solely on other antitrust watchdogs to take action. Given India's large user base for these social media giants, the CCI should assume the responsibility of addressing any malpractices by these platforms and maintaining fair competition in the market.\nCompetitionCCICompetition ActAbuse of DominanceMeta\nCompetition Law\n108 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Operational Debt and the Inevitable Dilemma of Computing Interest Without an Express Clause",
        "content": "Vishesh Bhardwaj, Bhabesh Satapathy\nJul 27\n6 min read\nOperational Debt and the Inevitable Dilemma of Computing Interest Without an Express Clause\n[Vishesh and Bhabesh are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code) was formed with the intent to resolve default in payments and strive to revive the debtor by repaying a portion of the debt back to the creditor. In multiple cases such as Swastik Enterprises v. Gammon India Limited, Krishna Enterprises v. Gammon India Limited, and Govind Sales v. Gammon India Limited, the total amount has not been calculated fairly due to the absence of an explicit interest clause. Recently, in the case of Mr V Umadevi v. Kumarna Gin and Pressing Private Limited, the NCLT was stumped with the question of computing interest without an explicit clause and the same was not computed because the NCLT was not able to ‘determine’ the amount of interest. \n\nIn this article, the authors strongly argue in favour of computation of interest in absence of an agreement for the same. Through this piece, the authors aim to suggest how the computation of interest can be done in a case where the operational debt has been interpreted widely regardless of an explicit clause in an agreement allowing them to do so. The authors suggest placing reliance upon the Sales of Goods Act 1930 (Act) and treating the scenario as an agreement to sell to rectify these issues.\n\nPurposive Interpretation of Operational Debt \n\nSection 5(20) of the Code defines the operational creditor (OC) as \"a person to whom operational debt is owed\". The term 'operational debt' has been clearly defined under Section 5(21) of the Code as \"a claim in respect of the provision of goods or services including employment or a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in force\".\n\nHere, it is pertinent to mention that the phrase \"in respect of\" before the phrase \"provision of goods and services\" gives rise to two potential interpretations. The first interpretation, which could be a narrow interpretation, indicates the phrase \"in respect of\" as denoting solely the provider's monetary claim against the corporate debtor (CD). The second interpretation, which could be a wide interpretation, expands the meaning of \"in respect of\" to encompass any claim, including that of the receiver of the goods and services. The aforementioned interpretations have clearly been observed in the case of Chipsan Aviation Private Limited v. Punj Llyod Aviation Limited (emphasis supplied). \n\nThe Supreme Court (SC), in the case of M/s Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited v M/s Hitro Energy Solutions Private Limited, by observing that “a purchaser of the goods or services, on occurrence of default on behalf of the CD, will also be considered as an OC”, has unequivocally rejected the contention supporting the narrow interpretation that excluded those individuals or entities who either received or were expected to receive goods and services from the CD. It further observed that a “claim” must have some connection with the “provision of goods and services” without explicitly stating the supplier or recipient. The aforementioned contentions have also been implicitly upheld in the case of Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited v. Union of India.  \n\nComputing Interest: Considering the Act \n\nIn numerous instances, tribunals and courts have failed to compute the amount of interest owing to the absence of an explicit interest clause in the contract. However, previously in an agreement to sell, the courts have computed interest even in the absence of an express clause. The same has been observed in the case of M.K.M. Moosa Bhai Amin, Kota v. Rajasthan Textile Mills, where the court granted reasonable interest without any stipulation of interest in the agreement. In cases where ‘operational debt’ has been interpreted broadly, the agreement of delivering the goods on the basis of advance payment should be treated as an agreement to sell. It can be treated under the Act because as opposed to the strict statutory interpretation of operational debt wherein a contract of sale is not formed, it allows the advance payment given by a buyer to the seller in exchange for goods or services to be treated as an operational debt, which is an agreement to sell under Section 4 of the Act.\n\nSection 61(2)(b) of the Act allows the court to award interest to the buyer on the amount paid if there is no agreement to the contrary. So, when it comes to a default in repayment, interest can be added to the total default amount when there is no agreement to the contrary. In the case of State Trading Corporation of India v. Tara Jewellers, the court awarded 6% interest to the buyer under Section 61(2)(b) of the Act without any specific clause pertaining to the rate of interest. Similarly, courts and tribunals have awarded 12% interest in cases like Stephen Chemical Limited v. Innosearch Limited and PK Vaduvammal v. Jaydev Constructions, respectively (emphasis supplied).\n\nIn the case of PK Vaduvammal v. Jaydev Constructions, it was held that Section 61 of the Act serves as a supplementary provision, rather than conflicting with any provisions of the Code. Its purpose is to allow for the payment of interest to operational creditors, a provision that is absent in the Code. Moreover, Section 66 of the Act states that insolvency rules will apply to the contracts for the sale of goods. With such an interplay of insolvency and contracts of sale of goods, the Act might be an option to compute interest in a case where an explicit clause of interest is not there. This will allow the Adjudicating Authority to function in an equitable and justifiable manner, respecting the objectives of the Code.\n\nThe courts and tribunals have always intended to award interest to ensure equity. In Dushyant Dalal v. SEBI, the SC allowed tribunals to award interest from the day the cause of action began to till the date the procedures for recovery of such interest in equity were commenced. Similarly, in Clariant International Limited and Another v. SEBI, the SC held that “interest can be awarded in terms of an agreement or statutory provisions. It can also be awarded by reason of usage or trade having the force of law or on equitable considerations.” Furthermore, tribunals have inherent powers to act in equity under Rule 11 of National Company Law Tribunal Rules 2016. As a result, interest may be added to the principal amount to determine the actual ‘operational debt’.\n\nThe Ramifications of Not Computing Interest: An Unleashing Chaos?\n\nComputation of interest is a common practice in commercial transactions. It ensures that the creditor is adequately compensated for the period during which the debt remained unpaid. The tribunal by including interest would unequivocally promote fairness and discourages defaulters from exploiting the absence of a contractual provision on interest.\n\nWithout the computation of interest, there will be a dispute regarding the total outstanding amount owed to the OC. The CD will argue that the principal amount is the only amount payable, while the OC will contend that interest should also be included. This would clearly lead to further litigation and delays in the resolution process. If the OC disagrees with the NCLT's decision not to compute interest, they may initiate separate legal proceedings to recover the interest amount. This can result in multiple proceedings in different forums, such as civil courts or arbitration tribunals, further prolonging the resolution process and increasing legal complexities. \n\nThe aforementioned contentions have been laid in various cases i.e., PK Vaduvammal v. Jaydev Constructions; Devendra Kumar Jain v. Polar Forgings and Tools Limited; and Stephen Chemical Limited v. Innosearch Limited, where it was conjunctively held that “even in absence of an agreement between the parties as to the rate of interest, the tribunal can determine the reasonable rate of interest in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings”.\n\nFurther, this delay in the recovery process for the OC by tribunal will indeed defeat the pivotal objective of the Code that is to expedite the resolution of debts in a time bound manner. And it will also defeat the legislative intent of Sections 61 and 66 of the Act.  \n\nMoreover, the exclusion of interest from the computation by the tribunal will definitely have a significant financial impact on the OC. Interest serves as compensation for the time value of money and the opportunity cost of delayed payment. Without interest, the OC may suffer financial losses and face difficulties in meeting their own financial obligations.\n\nConclusion \n\nThe adjudicating authorities can resolve a slew of concerns by considering the widely interpreted operational debt as an agreement to sell. Failure to compute interest in the absence of a specific provision may establish a negative precedent, discouraging the OCs from seeking resolution under code. The tribunal’s purpose should be to promote fairness throughout the resolution process. Even though the Code is not a debt collection instrument, the amount defaulted should be calculated equitably. A mechanism to compute interest is much needed as it violates the objectives of the Code by prolonging the resolution process. The Act seems to be a suitable statutory backing for computing interest when it comes to the default of widely interpreted operational debt due to the interconnection between the two legislations as seen in Section 66 of the Act. \nOperational CreditorsOperational DebtIBCInterest\nInsolvency Law\n168 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Examining the Potential Regulatory Landscape for Index Providers",
        "content": "Sakshi Nalawade\nJul 26\n7 min read\nExamining the Potential Regulatory Landscape for Index Providers\n[Sakshi is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nAn index is a standardized way to track the performance of a group of stocks, assets, etc., belonging to listed companies. To formulate an index a basket of securities are chosen, either from a specific sector or from the entire market, next a peculiar methodology is constructed and applied to track their performance in the market. The companies with appropriate infrastructure and human resources dedicated to design and calculate indexes are called 'index providers'.\n\nThe need for a regulatory grip on index providers appeared with the exponential growth of passive investment strategies since the year 2015, wherein a market index is tracked and replicated. Passive investing does not require the fund manager to actively select stocks for the purpose of investing, it comprises of a simple process in which investment is made in stocks similar to that of the index that is being tracked. This type of investing relies completely on an Index’s output. Additionally, the assets under management of passive investment schemes grew 34% in 2023, nearing a figure of INR 7 lakh crore. This situation raises serious concerns due to absolute reliability on an unregulated entity.  \n\nFurther, there are other market entities/participants that are accessing and relying on the indices to make crucial financial and investment decisions, for instance to ascertain the performance of equity or other assets of any company belonging to any specific sector, investment in mutual funds or alternative investment funds, etc. Currently, there are two prominent indices in India NIFTY 50, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSE Data and SENSEX, a joint venture of S&P Dow Jones Indices and BSE Limited. Accordingly, they are associated with and under the purview of the Exchanges registered with the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI). There are no private players on their own yet, but it cannot be presumed that there would not be any private parties operating independently of the exchanges in the future.\n\nConsidering the above, it seems essential to ensure that the indices are undertaking proper due diligence and deploying a fair and transparent mechanism to arrive at a benchmark.  \n\nIn light of the above, on 28 December 2020, the SEBI released a consultation paper on composing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the \"index providers\". Through this framework, SEBI seeks to instill transparency, openness and address conflicts of interest in the benchmark-setting process. It is based on the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks (IOSCO Principles), which is also the basis of regulation of index providers in many foreign jurisdictions. \n\nThe Proposed Regulation\n\nThe regulation would apply to domestic as well as foreign index providers, given that their users are based in India. Accordingly, the indices being tracked by Indian investors and having a minimum net worth of INR 25 crores would mandatorily have to get registered with SEBI to operate as an index provider. Moreover, an individual is not allowed to be an index provider, only a legal Company is. Further, the regulatory framework clearly defines the role and liabilities of the Administrators, it lays down a code of conduct for the Submitters and imposes a mandatory internal framework when certain services would be outsourced by the providers. Concerning the maintenance of transparency and addressing the client's interests, the framework mandates the formation of an oversight committee, which would review the indices design and various aspects pertaining to its methodology, and a grievance redressal mechanism for solving internal conflicts.\n\n Another welcome feature of the new framework is the compulsory enactment of internal policies and procedures to manage conflicts of interest that might arise due to the element of discretion used in the management of indices, such as while rebalancing or reconstitution of the index. For instance, the index providers work very closely with the AMCs who track them for benchmarking or index funds, the employees of index providers could easily transfer information of the inclusion or exclusion of certain securities in the process of determining the benchmark, to the fund managers in exchange of personal benefits. Such situations could be curbed by having appropriate internal checks in place, like deploying a Chinese wall or restriction on circulation of information amongst the staff as suggested in the framework. \n\nRecently, SEBI in its board meeting gave an in-principle approval to this framework. The proposed mechanism has a wide scope that addresses many issues concerning the governance of index providers in India. However, it fails to include certain guidelines essential for the operation of the indices in challenging situations. They have been briefly discussed below. \n\nAnalysis\n\nPolicy on transition\n\nThe framework is duly based on the IOSCO Principles, but it has not included within its ambit appropriate guidelines for the 'transition' of a benchmark, which has been significantly delved into in the report provided by IOSCO. According to the IOSCO Principles, transition guidelines should be in place in case there is a need for possible cessation of a benchmark. The need for cessation could arise due to changes in market structure, product definition, or any other condition because of which the benchmark becomes no longer representative of its intended interest. \n\nSEBI should consider making the incorporation of appropriate policy concerning the Transition of benchmark mandatory. As per the IOSCO guidelines, the policies should include provisions with the criteria for the selection of a credible alternative benchmark, the practicality of maintaining parallel benchmarks, procedures in case a suitable alternative could not be identified, the intended time period while the benchmark would be operating, and the procedure for engaging stakeholders, regulator and national authorities for noting their views/opinions. Further, the IOSCO Principles suggest that the policies and procedures should be proportionate to the estimated breadth and depth of contracts and financial instruments that reference a benchmark and the economic and financial stability impact that might result from the cessation of the benchmark. It also states that while formulating these policies views of the stakeholders, the relevant regulators, and national authorities should be duly considered.\n\nThere should be a mechanism in place for the clients of the index providers to fall back on, providing them with a timely solution or enabling them to claim help from the index providers to navigate through the situation.  \n\nPolicy on contingency plans\n\nRecently, IOSCO released a consultation paper looking to understand the dynamics of asset managers and index providers, to completely examine the potential conflicts of interest. As part of this consultation paper, IOSCO is seeks to understand what governance arrangements index providers have in place in case of “exceptional market events”. It has made a clear distinction between 'regular' and 'ad-hoc exceptional' circumstances, regular such as corporate actions and the latter being unforeseeable situations like COVID-19 or the Russian market collapse due to the Russia-Ukraine War.\n\nThe Russian invasion was so grave on the capital market forces that it compelled Weiner Boerse a global index provider to abruptly discontinue its benchmark for RDX and AMC along with 14 other indices. Further, index providers led by MSCI decided to remove Russian securities from their emerging market indices at a price that is effectively zero, AMCs like BlackRock and Invesco terminated their Russia and Eastern Europe ETFs as they had become untradeable. This caused a total market collapse affecting the operations of index providers and in some cases even forcing them to shut down.\n\nConsidering the impact of ad hoc exceptional circumstances, the IOSCO consultation paper expects indices to have a structured mechanism to operate during such situations. Further, it seeks to understand the nature of the mechanism to examine whether it is comprehensive enough. Efforts on a global level are being taken, and understanding its importance, SEBI should incorporate contingency provisions into the new framework to deal with unforeseeable and exceptional circumstances. The mechanism might be of a committee structure, including provisions to deal with different issues that might arise, for instance, liquidity issues impacting the sufficiency of the indices or having appropriate disclosures of actions to be taken to be made to the clients within a timely manner.\n\nThe possibility of index providers as investment advisors: Would it be viable in the Indian securities market?\n\nThe Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) of US has released a discussion paper with the objective to assess whether index providers should be reclassified as ‘Investment Advisors’ which would eventually impact their regulation by the SEC. This is because of the increasing influence of index providers in the US market, for instance, inclusion of a company’s stock for benchmarking creates a significant demand for that stock and exclusion from benchmark leads to decline of its demand and price. These instances give the apprehension of index providers providing investment advice. \n\nIf we consider reclassification of index providers as investment advisors in Indian securities market, this change comes with some serious regulatory challenges. The investment advisers by the virtue of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations 2013 have the obligation of fiduciary duty towards their clients - on the other hand, whether index providers owe such fiduciary duty towards their clients is currently a moot point. Further, the functioning of both intermediaries diversely differ - index providers follow a methodology for index compilation, whereas investment advisers understand the financial condition of their clients and undertake research to analyze investments, strategies and market conditions based on which they provide the most appropriate investment option for their client. In comparison, the impact of the index provider’s benchmark on buying and selling of stocks could be construed as merely passive advising. It is to be noted that such passive advising is an inherent by-product of the provider’s main objective of benchmarking. \n\nAccordingly, if India considers adopting such reclassification, it would alter the fundamentals of index providing and the way in which they currently operate. The regulatory oversight over them would tighten making it difficult to maintain their independence for achieving their main objective of benchmarking. However, considering the influence of such passive advising on market investments and the power the provider gains due to this, it should not go unchecked by the regulator.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the new framework (including or excluding the provisions suggested herein above) is enforced, India would be the second jurisdiction in the world after the European Union to have a comprehensive framework for the regulation of index providers, leaving behind countries such as the US, Singapore and Australia in this aspect. SEBI seems to be widening its regulatory scope and trying to monitor the areas wherein issues have not yet began. It is indeed a welcome move which will strength SEBI’s grip on the market participants, prevent abuse of the information asymmetry and maintain investor’s trust in the market.\nSEBIIndex ProvidersIOSCO Principles\nCorporate Law\n67 views\n11 likes.

        "title": "Mind Your Business: Minority Shareholder Protection in Private M&A",
        "content": "Bhaskar Vishwajeet\nJul 26\n6 min read\nMind Your Business: Minority Shareholder Protection in Private M&A\n[Bhaskar is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nModern-day corporations are notorious for merging to optimize resource allocation and cashing in on unexplored/technically efficient areas of specialization. That said, the new-age company is not impervious to corporate improprieties. A slew of disputes that involve accounting fraud, share manipulation etc., have resulted in a strict regime of company regulation. This has motivated several developments in, among all, the securities law that governs M&A. \n\nOne of the chief objectives of securities law is shareholder protection, especially minority shareholder protection, to ensure that publicly listed companies do not sidestep a strand of contributors to their corporate finance, i.e., the minority shareholders. Shareholders might vary in number, but, more importantly, in terms of class too. Tata Motors, for instance, is known for having multiple classes of shareholders with varying voting rights. \n\nA shareholder’s class is decided by their voting rights within the corporate structure. Section 47 of the Companies Act 2013 defines a voting right as the right to vote on company resolutions commensurate with one’s proportion of shares in the paid-up equity share capital of the company. It can be inferred that Sections 235 and 395 of the Companies Act 2013 prescribe that all members who hold up to 10% of the paid-up shares of a company constitute the minority (however, in essence, these are the 1/10th shareholders who dissent to a scheme). This limit is critical when making a representation of oppression or mismanagement to the courts or appropriate authority. \n\nHow minority shareholders are treated is an important aspect of how companies operate and transact. Multiple jurisdictions have kept evolving the standards of minority shareholder protection. Singapore, for instance, has a four-limb test of minority oppression under Section 216 of the Singapore Companies Act 1967 that focuses on inter alia unfair discrimination and prejudice. These factors are broadly derived from the judgement in Over & Over, wherein the court held that minority shareholder protection must be based on fairness and the cumulative effect of the impugned conduct. A similar process was laid down for Indian companies in Needle Industries, according to which Indian courts check for a cumulative effect of mala fide intentions, i.e., mere illegality will not qualify as oppression unless motivated by wrongful intent. For example – in rights issues that are compliant with norms, diluting a shareholder’s holdings may be legal but may still be scrutinized on the grounds of being oppressive. \n\nTherefore, it is evident that securities law is in a constant state of flux in so far as rigorous standards of protecting minority shareholders are concerned. Allied legislation is frequently updated and derives from contemporary practices in foreign jurisdictions. The chief legislations that concern securities regulation in M&A are the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR) and the SEBI  (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018. The SEBI recently amended the LODR through a second amendment, which in turn was based on a consultation paper released earlier this year. The author participated in the consultation process by sending comments, which will be discussed here. \n\nThis piece concerns sub-notification XII of the amendment, i.e., the insertion of Regulation 37A in the LODR. It analyzes the utility of the amendment through a comparison, providing insight into the way forward. \n\nDiscussing the New Insertion \n\nRegulation 37 of the LODR stipulates requirements for draft schemes of arrangement by listed companies. The regulation states that listed companies can file draft schemes of arrangement under the merger provisions in the Companies Act 2013, provided they have a no-objection letter from the stock exchange. The no-objection letter must be further placed before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to seek approval for the scheme of arrangement. This regulation has limited requirements as the restructuring mechanism, i.e., the scheme of arrangement, is tribunal driven. The presence of a quasi-judicial authority signifies comprehensive scrutiny of shareholder rights while probing approval of a scheme. As such, Regulation 37 does not require explicit mention of the manner of exercising shareholder rights when deciding approval for schemes.  \n\nRegulation 37A, the new insertion, must be considered an exception to Regulation 37. If Regulation 37 is for court-driven processes, Regulation 37A is for arrangements outside that process. It speaks of private transactions (without approaching the court/NCLT) involving undertakings. The most common private transaction of this sort is a ‘slump sale’, a particularly Indian phenomenon in company law wherein an undertaking is sold on an ‘as is’ or ‘going concern’ basis through business transfer agreements (BTA). The regulation further states that listed companies must obtain approval from the shareholders through special resolutions and disclose the commercial reasons behind the transaction when pursuing private transactions involving undertakings. \n\nThere are two interesting caveats to this. Regulation 37A is qualified by two provisos, i.e., it comes with riders to the preconditions discussed above. First, the special resolution seeking approval for the sale of the undertaking must be approved by a majority of the minority of shareholders. This means that public shareholders in the minority will decide whether such sales go through. The amendment is important as it reinforces the importance of having minimum public shareholding, but even more importantly, empowering the public shareholders with critical voting rights on issues that inevitably affect the value of their shareholding. \n\nIn the comments submitted in the consultation paper, the author argues that BTAs are preferred to court-mandated schemes of arrangement for slump sales due to the relatively beneficial taxation regime applicable to a slump sale outside schemes of arrangement. BTAs that involve transfers as a \"going concern\" are exempt from GST payments. Nevertheless, Section 188 of the Companies Act 2013 prescribes that BTAs between ‘related parties’ may cause conflicts of interest, and the minority shareholders may be sidelined in crucial decisions concerning the business (undertaking) being transferred. The amendment is a step in the right direction to avoid such instances. \n\nThat said, even though obtaining votes from the majority of the minority is important, it needs to be understood that the company's day-to-day functioning should not be affected due to cumbersome regulatory requirements. Maintaining a balance between transaction costs and the rights of the minority is essential. Section 180 of the Companies Act 2013 stipulates restrictions on the powers of the Board of Directors when selling or leasing undertakings. Undertakings are purposely defined as investments where the company has invested 20% or more of its net worth or investments that generate 20% of the company’s total income. The author submits that the investment thresholds in the explanations to Section 180 should be increased or reconsidered. This is because, with the new amendment, there is a universal requirement for all undertakings (investments beyond with at least 20% value) to seek minority shareholder approval. Such a blanket requirement might increase the transaction costs for compliance and lead to situations where almost no sale is approved by minority shareholders. \n\nThus, the new amendment for non-scheme transactions nullifies the inability of the minority shareholders to block special resolutions by requiring that said special resolutions be approved by a majority of the minority. \n\nComparisons with the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom is the closest legal regime to India as Indian deal structures, including the judicial schemes of arrangement, were derived from the UK’s company law. In the United Kingdom, shareholders with less than 50% of a company's holdings are technically classified as the minority. However, the requirement to block special resolutions is the same as in India, i.e., at least 25%. Shareholders under 25% can only seek redressal of their claims through derivative actions or statutory claims of unfairness under Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006. There are no statutory prescriptions that specifically empower minority shareholders with rights in special situations like the execution of business purchase agreements (UK equivalent of the BTA). \n\nThe law in India is thus more certain and predictable in terms of protecting minority shareholders through special rights on certain transactions. This may also be attributed to the unique dominance of promoter-driven companies in India and the subsequent suspicion of their management style, hence the explicit requirement that minority shareholders be protected. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe amendment is a welcome step in aligning private M&A with identical checks by the NCLT through schemes, thereby protecting shareholders. The difference between Regulations 37 and 37A may be summed up as one of stages. That is to say, Regulation 37 mandates protections in court, whereas Regulation 37A protects shareholders by providing statutory guidance for post-facto claims, if any. Notwithstanding that, legislators must consider assessing the ramifications of allowing minority shareholders with such power, especially when the threshold for what constitutes an investment (undertaking) is this low. This could help balance the competing interests of regulation and commercial activity. \nSEBILODRNCLTM&A\nCorporate Law\n235 views\n5 likes. Post not marked as liked\n5"

        "title": "Taxing Unearned Income: An Insight into Windfall Taxes",
        "content": "Parth Birla, Sakshi Tiwari\nJul 25\n7 min read\nTaxing Unearned Income: An Insight into Windfall Taxes\n[Parth and Sakshi are students at Hidayatullah National Law University Raipur and Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University Lucknow, respectively.]\n\nThe windfall taxes have again come to the news with the Central Government announcing to completely slash it from INR 4,100 to nil on the domestic petroleum crude oil exports. While previously the government reduced it from INR 6,400 per tonne to INR 4,100 per tonne. The adoption of windfall taxes was a general idea and has been prominent in the news globally due to the change in its trend. Countries worldwide like the UK, Italy and Germany have already levied a windfall tax or are in the process of imposing it. The taxes were first levied by governments worldwide to curb the supernormal profits earned by the public and private energy companies who chose to export fuel to reap the benefits of skyrocketing global prices while affecting domestic supplies. \n\nThe taxes were announced by the government on 30 June 2022 (came into force on 1 July 2022) and were under continuous revision every fortnight. The taxes were introduced with the view to restrict the sale of crude oil exports and prevent any further effect on domestic supplies. The rise in exports was a result of an imbalance between energy supply and demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was further exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. With the prices equaling to pre-war times, the government issued a notification to reduce the taxes on the fuels. The article is an attempt to analyze the different aspects of windfall taxes in India and assess the need for such taxes at the global level while linking it to the prevailing economic conditions. \n\nWindfall Gains and Taxes\n\nA windfall gain is an income which accrues to an individual or an organization due to unexpected and sudden developments in the market due to market forces and other factors. The windfall gain concerning an individual can be a one-time event such as winning a lottery, a settlement award from a lawsuit, inheritance of a share in property etc. However, from the point of view of an organization or company, the ambit of windfall income is fairly vast. The changing geopolitical affairs and government regulations on trade policy affect the product market of the country or world and lead to organizations earning unexpected returns from the prevailing circumstances. Proceeds or profit from a large sale also fall in the realm of a windfall gain.\n\nA windfall tax can be referred to as the tax levied on some unanticipated gain in income through no additional efforts or expenses. Essentially, the income on which the tax is charged must be earned due to unforeseeable circumstances. The rationale behind charging such taxes is to constrain the producers or manufacturers from benefiting from unanticipated income or windfall income. Companies frequently earn windfall profits in sectors like crude oil, where supply and demand are the primary factors influencing the price of the product turning it highly volatile in nature. In India, a prominent development took place recently in the energy sector as the government decided to charge taxes on the unforeseen income earned by the oil (energy) companies due to the geopolitical changes witnessed in the Russia-Ukraine region. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not just affect the livelihood and economic conditions of the citizens of the country but also the markets, economies and businesses worldwide. These taxes are usually retrospective and transitory in nature. For instance, in 2008, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil cost nearly $130 jumping from roughly $60 a year earlier. Oil and gas companies earned enormous profits, but they were short-lived because a barrel of oil was only trading at $40 per barrel just five months after the price peaked.\n\nLegal Application \n\nSince determining the unusual market behaviour which leads to unanticipated gains is a highly subjective concept, the legality of the windfall tax becomes crucial. Although there is no specific law in India that addresses this issue at the moment, it is safe to say that the government is well within its rights to enact such legislation and rules on taxation under Article 265 of the Constitution of India which mentions “no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law.” According to this, the executive through a notification is empowered to make laws in accordance with the following legal provisions.\n The government terms windfall taxes as special additional excise duty which is applied to high-value items. These duties are levied through the Central Excise Tariff Act 1985 and can be applied retrospectively. Section 3 of the abovementioned statute also provides emergency power to the Central Government to increase excise duty given that circumstances exist. The power to apply these additional duties, with the view to promoting the public interest, also emanates from the Fourth Schedule to the Central Excise Act 1944 and Section 147 of the Finance Act 2002. Thus, these additional profits of energy sector companies can be taxed through the above-mentioned provisions. \n\nWindfall Taxes: A Two-Fold View\n\nAnalysis of the government’s policy reflects that the windfall taxes have proved to be a double-edged sword. The taxes, on the one hand, become an asset for the government, when it tries to convert such abnormal monetary benefits into investments for social causes and the welfare of the people. On the other hand, levying such taxes, even though retrospective in nature, act as a demotivating factor for producers and the industry as a whole. The increase in such windfall taxes takes away the opportunity to invest in better and more efficient production tools and techniques, and research and development. \n\nWhile one of the most certain benefits of charging such taxes is the increment in government revenue, another major reason is its efficiency. An argument advanced in favour of a one-off windfall tax is that it is more efficient due to its retrospective nature and that it is based on an external event or change. Charging such a tax is more efficient than imposing a corporate or personal tax as it will find its implication in the future due to which the companies or producers may change or specifically negate their operations to lower their production to decline the taxes. Such behaviour further impacts the economic well-being of the nation while windfall taxes are free from such concerns. They are also more predictable as they are based on past income and events which makes it fair to impose and easy to comply with even for the companies.\n\nHowever, true to its nature it is accompanied by certain drawbacks. Since these taxes are imposed on an ad-hoc basis, such imposition affects the investments done by the investors. Eventually, it could also lead to a change in the location of such industries in order to avoid such taxes which can be detrimental for the countries that are heavily dependent on such investments and revenues. It might deter the pace of investment even in the renewable energy sector as it discourages the companies to invest and further slows down the development towards increased energy security. Another disincentive can be the ambiguity around what will constitute normal gain and what shall go out of its ambit. The imposition of such taxes also gives way to a one-off subsidy. The oil companies which are asked to pay such windfall taxes may also demand a one-off subsidy as the prices which soar high due to external market factors may also collapse due to the same factors. Such possibilities can be difficult for the government to handle and hence adds up to the drawbacks.\n\nGlobal Status \n\nWindfall taxes are meant to redistribute gains for the benefit of society as a whole, and not to penalize a particular sector for making excessive profits. The main reason behind the imposition of windfall taxes was the increasing trade deficit of India and a weak rupee that had increased the value of India’s imports. The USA has been imposing such taxes since the 1980s through the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act 1980, and even Britain has continued the trend of levying such taxes since 1981. In the present scenario, the IMF has suggested that countries impose windfall taxes in the energy sector due to the soaring prices of fossil fuel all over the world. It argues that using tax measures aimed at taxing the “extra” income can be opted for without discouraging investment and will limit future price increases. The UN Secretary-General recommended nations levy windfall taxes on businesses that had profited immensely from the surge in the price of fossil fuels. As a result, nations including the UK, Germany, and others have considered imposing windfall taxes. The possibility of permanent imposition of windfall tax cannot be ruled out in the context of the current state of affairs of the global economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoherent to its volatile nature the windfall tax domain presents varied benefits and losses to different stakeholders. The critical analysis of the data presented by the authorities suggests that crude oil prices internationally and the imposition of windfall taxes go hand in hand in India. For instance, as per the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), crude oil prices were as high as $116.01 per barrel in June 2022 and then came down to $78.10 per barrel in December. The trend witnesses an eventual replication with respect to windfall taxes as they were introduced and then slashed by the government. It is worthwhile to note that these taxes turned out to be a big source of income with the government earning at least INR 25,000 crore in the last financial cycle, which was not anticipated in the budget. \n\nThus, it can be construed that the windfall taxes with respect to India, even though they are necessary for the country’s economy, should not be arbitrary in nature and demand a better legislation framework. The present situation substantiates the need for more organized and specific laws for taxing these profits. Keeping in mind the current policy of the government regarding impromptu revisions in the tax rates, it can be said that it creates uncertainty in the markets and economy. However, the imposition of these taxes does serve the greater good of society to some extent while keeping oil companies in a disadvantageous position.\nWindfall TaxFinance ActCentral Excise Tariff Act\nTaxation Law\n236 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Additional Disclosure Requirements for FPIs: A Welcome Change or Just Another Regulatory Hussle?",
        "content": "Vaibhav Gupta\nJul 24\n6 min read\nAdditional Disclosure Requirements for FPIs: A Welcome Change or Just Another Regulatory Hussle?\n[Vaibhav is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe Adani Group's stocks appear to have weathered the storm caused by the Hindenburg report but the SEBI does not seem to be taking a backseat yet, aiming to prove the stronghold of its regulatory framework. In a fresh endeavour to enhance transparency and foster trust, SEBI has recently issued a consultation paper proposing additional disclosures from 'high-risk' foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). This move comes in response to SEBI's ongoing struggle to identify the economic stakeholders behind FPIs that have invested in Adani's stocks.\n\nThis article mulls into the changes set forth by SEBI [which go beyond Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA), and the PML (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005 (PML Rules)]. This article further explores the potential challenges that may arise in bringing these amendments to life.\n\nIssues Identified\n\nSEBI, in its consultation paper, has flagged the following two issues:\n\nConcentrated group investments by FPIs and potential circumvention of minimum public shareholding norms\n\nSEBI has observed that certain FPI’s holdings are concentrated substantially in a single investee/group, sometimes remaining unchanged for long durations, thereby raising a concern that the promoters or other persons acting in concert are using the guise of FPIs to flout MPS norms, thereby increasing the risk of manipulation and fraudulent activities.\n\nPotential misuse of FPI route to circumvent Press Note 3 stipulations\n\nVide Press Note 3 (PN3), the Government of India inter alia required that in the event (i) entities situated in countries sharing a land border with India; or (ii) beneficial owners of investments in India are situated in or are citizens of such countries, investment can be carried out only under the government route. As PN3 did not apply to FPIs, they could be used to circumvent the provisions under PN3. SEBI has observed that in certain instances, while the FPI is not based out of countries sharing a land border with India, its beneficial owners were based out of such countries.\n\nBeneficial Owner\n\nIn terms of the PMLA, a beneficial owner is “an individual who ultimately owns or controls a client of a reporting entity or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted and includes a person who exercises ultimate effective control over a juridical person”. Further, the PML Rules specify thresholds based on ownership (10% for companies and trusts, and 15% for partnerships etc.), economic interest or control for identification of a beneficial owner. In the event no beneficial owner is determinable, the senior managing official is deemed to be the beneficial owner.\n\nThe SEBI (FPI) Regulations 2019 read with the Master Circular for FPIs inter alia required designated depository participants to identify the beneficial owners on a ‘look through basis’, in the event the materiality threshold is exceeded at the FPI level. SEBI has observed that most investors are usually below the specified materiality thresholds. It is possible that the same natural person holds a significant interest in the FPI through different investment entities, each of which do not individually cross the threshold. \n\nProposal Put Forth by SEBI\n\nAs discussed, the proposed measures focus on enhancing transparency and identifying high-risk FPIs based on objective criteria. Therefore, to achieve the said objective SEBI has proposed that within Category I and Category II FPI registrations, further categorisation may be done, as follows:\n\nLow-risk FPIs\n\nGovernment and government-related entities such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds etc.\n\nModerate-risk FPIs \n\nPension funds or public retail funds as defined under Regulation 22(4) with widespread and dispersed investors in such funds. Categorisation of such FPIs as moderate risk shall be subject to the ability of DDPs to independently validate and confirm the status of such FPIs as pension funds or public retail funds with a wide and diverse investor base.\n\nHigh-risk FPIs\n\nAll other FPIs.\n\nIt is proposed that if additional disclosures are required, the risk categorisation will be considered along with the quantum of investments by the FPI in a single corporate group or on the basis of the overall equity AUM.\n\nPrevention of circumvention of MPS norms\n\nIt has been proposed that high-risk FPIs holding more than 50% of equity AUM in a single corporate group would be required to provide granular data of all entities with any ownership, economic interest, or control rights on a full look- through basis up to the level of all natural persons and/or public retail funds or large public listed entities. Additionally, any material change is to be notified to the DDP within 7 working days.\n\nMoreover, high-risk FPIs would be required to bring down their exposure below 50% within 6 months. In case of breaches on an ongoing basis, it is proposed to provide a window of 10 days to bring down such concentration, failing which the additional disclosure requirements will kick in. It may also be noted that FPIs who have just begun investments be allowed to cross the 50% group concentration up to a period of 6 months, within which the concentration would have to be brought down. A similar leeway has been proposed in relation to FPIs which are in the process of winding down their investments.\n\nSome reclassification has also been proposed as some high-risk FPIs with relatively small India-oriented AUM compared to their global AUM may be reclassified as moderate risk if their exposure to a single India-related corporate group remains below 25% of their overall AUM. These reclassified FPIs would be exempt from certain additional disclosure requirements.\n\nPrevention of misuse of the FPI route for circumvention of PN3\n\nIt has been proposed that existing high-risk FPIs with an overall holding in Indian equity markets of over INR 25,000 crores would be required to comply with granular disclosure requirements within 6 months, failing which the FPI would be required to bring down its AUM. With respect to FPIs that cross the above threshold in the future, the timeline for complying with providing granular details is proposed to be 3 months, failing which the AUM would have to be brought down below INR 25,000 crores.\n\nRoadblocks Ahead\n\nThe outlined changes aimed at enhancing transparency and trust in the market have generated both optimism and concerns. While the intentions behind these proposed regulations are commendable, a closer examination reveals several challenges that could potentially undermine their effectiveness. These hurdles raise doubts regarding the practical impact of the regulations, leading to apprehensions about their efficacy and the extent of their actual benefits.\n\nConflicting confidentiality considerations\n\nThe requirement for FPIs to disclose granular information about their investors, disregarding existing rules and secrecy laws in their domicile jurisdictions, is highly contentious. From a broader point of view, on one hand the RBI and the Ministry of Finance has flatly refused any kind of inspection rights to the European Securities and Markets Authority to clearing corporations in India, while on the other hand, SEBI is asking investors to forego the rights conferred to them under the secrecy laws of their own country. Such inconsistencies raise questions about fairness, consistency, and reciprocity in the regulatory approach, warranting a more balanced framework that respects confidentiality concerns while ensuring transparency and trust in India’s financial markets. Additionally, these requirements can be challenged by entities located in other jurisdictions as violative of their local laws as well as their right to privacy.\n\nA potential loophole: Uncovering a critical oversight\n\nWhile SEBI has taken note of investor investing in an FPI via different investing entities keeping their share below the pre-defined threshold limit to be identified as beneficial owner, a significant concern looms large. SEBI might have failed to anticipate a scenario where investors channel their investments into a company through multiple FPIs, carefully ensuring that no single entity surpasses the 50% exposure threshold while keeping the fund size below INR 25,000 crores. This apparent loophole in the regulations poses a substantial challenge and could potentially undermine the integrity of the proposed changes, rendering them ineffective.\n\nEnforcement dependencies\n\nIn terms of enforcement, the SEBI has shouldered the responsibility of getting the granular details of the investor to DDPs, but the DDP might not have access to any information beyond the legal ownership. This limitation may result in a dependence on FPIs to provide the necessary details, potentially compromising the accuracy and effectiveness of SEBI's enforcement efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe industry's positive reception of SEBI's proposed amendments highlights the recognition of the need for enhanced transparency and trust in India's financial markets. However, the journey towards achieving these goals requires a concerted effort to address the challenges that lie ahead. By proactively tackling the aforesaid issues, the effectiveness of the proposed amendments can be maximized. It is through these proactive measures that the desired outcomes of fostering transparency and trust can be realised, ultimately benefiting the industry and strengthening India's financial ecosystem.\nFPISEBIMPS\nCorporate Law\n95 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Revisiting the Scope of Authority of CCI to Review Powers of Statutory Bodies",
        "content": "Palak Dwivedi, Aayush Laddha\nJul 23\n6 min read\nRevisiting the Scope of Authority of CCI to Review Powers of Statutory Bodies\n[Palak and Aayush are students at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) is broadly empowered to eliminate anti-competitive practices and promote competition, as per Section 18 of the Competition Act 2002 (Act). The statutory language of the Act indicates likelihood of confusion as Section 60 of the Act asserts the supremacy of the Act by providing it an overriding effect while, on the other hand, Section 62 of the Act provides for the CCI to “work along with other statutes”. Evidently, these three sections lie at the root of the tussle between CCI and other regulators. However, Section 18 of the Act seems to be in harmony with the law in international jurisdictions like the European Union. It is imperative for the law-makers to bring more clarity to the scope of jurisdiction of CCI to avoid any probable tension.\n\nThe Delhi High Court (DHC), on 2 June 2023, in the case of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Competition Commission of India (ICAI), made an attempt to define the scope of jurisdiction of CCI which shall be analyzed in the article to understand the current position of Indian antitrust regime on this issue. In analyzing the scope of authority of CCI, the article delves into (i) the widening of the investigative powers of the Director-General (DG); and (ii) jurisdiction overlap between CCI and other statutory bodies.\n\nCurbing the Investigative Dominion of CCI\n\nSection 26(1) of the Act empowers CCI to order an investigation, by DG, if CCI is of “the opinion” that there exists a prima facie case for investigation. The Act loosely provides power to CCI to conduct an investigation based on opinion, and resultantly, the scope of DG’s investigative powers has widened. In the case of Competition Commission of India v. Steel Authority of India and Another (SAIL), it was observed that Section 26(1) of the Act is a “mere direction for investigation to one of the wings” and the additional facts can be examined by DG. Furthermore, the increase in the number of dawn raids by CCI on the basis of “reasonable apprehension” is also a matter of concern as the fairness and due process of the raids are doubtful. In the case of SAIL, even the principles of natural justice were waived off at the initial stage of enquiry by CCI, which is a clear violation of procedural safeguards. Contrary to the position taken in the case of SAIL, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in the case of Delta Pekárny v. Czech Republic, held that dawn raids cannot breach the right to privacy as per Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus, there is a clear need to settle the dust surrounding the unfettered powers of CCI. However, this was not always the case; a change in approach has emerged post COVID-19, wherein CCI has adopted a very dynamic approach by imposing increased penalties, conducting detailed market studies, and higher number of dawn raids. Now, this has led to both effective discharge of CCI’s duties and jurisdictional overlapping.\n\nBreaking Down the Case of ICAI \n\nDHC, in this landmark case, addressed the following issues:\n\nWhether ICAI would fall within the scope of the Act; and\nWhether there is a case of abuse of dominant position against ICAI by creating monopoly in the form of providing Continuing Professional Education (CPE) seminars as a regulator, as per Section 4(1) of the Act.\n\nDHC answered first issue in the affirmative and held that ICAI is an enterprise as per Section 2(h) of the Act even if it carries out regulatory functions. Furthermore, it was observed that ICAI adds “value to the field of accountancy”, which amounts to an economic activity. On this basis, DHC rules that it cannot be excluded from the scope of the Act.\n\nComing to second issue, DHC denied CCI’s contention that the CPE program, which is conducted to enroll Chartered Accountant and to maintain a standard of professional qualifications as per Section 30(k) of the Chartered Accountants Act 1949, was a non-regulatory function. DHC, while addressing this issue, dealt with the moot question of whether CCI, as a market regulator, possessed the authority to scrutinize the decisions of other statutory regulators that are not linked to trade and commerce and are performed merely to discharge their regulatory duties. As per Section 2(w) of the Act, ICAI was held to be a statutory body and that CCI cannot review the subject-matter as they do not account for trade and commerce.\n\nStatutory bodies such as ICAI have the fettered right to make decisions as a part of its regulatory powers, and CCI cannot intervene. In the light of this, DHC interpreted Section 62 of the Act to imply powers of CCI as being “in addition and not in derogation of other statutes”. Thus, DHC held that the CPE program is not an abuse of its dominant position and further, rejecting CCI’s contention of “organisation of CP seminars / workshops / conferences” as a relevant market.\n\nIs the Issue of CCI Jurisdiction Overlap Put to Rest?\n\nThe issue of jurisdiction overlap by regulatory authorities has been a bone of contention for years now. For instance, in the case of Shri Neeraj Malhotra v. North Delhi Power Limited and Others, it was alleged that the electricity distribution companies indulged in antitrust activities. The Act’s statutory language caused confusion and uncertainty. and the Electricity Act 2003 (2003 Act), with respect to, which authority shall exercise jurisdiction, the CCI or the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC), it was directed that electricity tariff aspect would be dealt by DERC and the anti-competitive aspect would be investigated by CCI. To further complicate the overlap, as per Section 60 of the 2003 Act, DERC has the power to issue directions, in case of abuse of dominant position related to the electricity industry. This is just one of the instances of jurisdiction overlap due to unclear statutory language. The ICAI judgment has brought much-awaited clarity on the issue of jurisdictional scope of CCI. DHC has noted that the role of CCI is that of a market regulator and, not that of a “grievance redressal portal or an appellate court for any statutory body”, thereby limiting its scope. Additionally, DHC held that CCI cannot compel an organisation to outsource its activities, even if it forms part of an economic activity.\n\nInterestingly, CCI contended that the order under Section 26(1) of the Act was “an administrative / interdepartmental direction for merely conducting an investigation and it cannot be interfered with.” However, this was not addressed by DHC in its judgment. This judgment is a positive step, but there is a strict need for a clear and precise language in the Act to avoid any further confusions. The inherent contradiction in the language of Sections 60 and 62 of the Act must be resolved.\n\nLessons From the USA\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division have a defined jurisdiction in the antitrust cases. They have a well-defined clearance process which provides for “primary areas of responsibility, on an industry-wide basis”. As a result, even though there is an overlap in DOJ’s and FTC’s civil enforcement jurisdictions, they seem to have an amicable relationship. The clearance process even covers instances where both DOJ and FTC seek clearance to review the same transaction, referred to as “contested clearance”, the agencies can even escalate the decision. If no resolution is reached, the final clearance decisions may ultimately be made by the Assistant Attorney General for DOJ and the Chair for FTC. In a study conducted by United States Government Accountability Office, it was concluded that “DOJ and FTC jurisdictions overlap, but conflicts are infrequent”. This is a very efficient and timely solution to the problem of jurisdictional overlap eclipsing CCI.\n\nThe Competition (Amendment) Act 2023 Unleashes Quandary\n\nThe Competition Amendment Act 2023 (Amendment) aims at revamping Indian competition law regime vis-à-vis technology industry. However, it has further broadened the scope of DG’s powers. Firstly, the power of appointment of DG has shifted from the Central Government to CCI. Secondly, the Amendment has widened the power of DG to investigate “officers and other employees and agents (including legal advisors)of the party being investigated”, which is in clear violation of Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 which provides for lawyer-client confidentiality, consequently leading to more unfettered power to DG.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ICAI judgment was the need of the hour in the light of unfair dawn raids, stricter penalties, and widening of investigative powers of DG. The judgment has led to the much-needed compartmentalization of authorities for streamlining regulatory process, and better oversight. CCI needs to pay closer attention to the due process of law while conducting investigations under Section 26(1) of the Act. One of the possible solutions is to adopt formal schemes such as clearance process of the USA for better coordination.\nICAICCIDGCompetition Act\nCompetition Law\n261 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Offshore Derivative Instruments: Regulations in India",
        "content": "Manya Sharma\nJul 21\n5 min read\nOffshore Derivative Instruments: Regulations in India\n[Manya is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nIn light of offshore derivative contracts being recognised as valid in Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) City as part of the 2023 budget announcement, participatory notes (P-notes) are set to make a full-fledged comeback in Indian markets after a series of partial bans by Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) over the years. This article delves into the laws regulating offshore derivative instruments (ODIs) in India, and its role in Indian markets while tracing its journey since its first ban in 2007. This article also attempts to provide some suggestions which can be implemented under the existing regime, keeping in view the recent developments. \n\nWhat are Offshore Derivative Instruments?\n\nODI is a route for foreign investors who are not registered with SEBI to get exposure to Indian securities. These foreign investors do not deal directly in the Indian stock market, as they are not registered with the SEBI, and simply enjoy the lower transactional costs and minimal restrictions as compared to direct participation.\n\nThese offshore investors invest via foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who are already registered with the SEBI. The FIIs such as the foreign banks set up in India, issue ODIs to any offshore investor and consequently acquire securities in the Indian market on behalf of the relevant offshore investor. The investor is entitled to receive dividends and capital gains out of the security hedged onshore, or is liable to pay to FII in case of loss. This arrangement between an FII and offshore investor is executed typically by way of total return swap contracts.\n\nIn India, P-notes are the most used form of ODIs and these terms are often used interchangeably. P-notes are a great way of increasing foreign investment inflow in the country, without any regulatory hassles. It encourages high net worth individuals, small hedge funds, and other individuals to invest in Indian securities. \n\nODIs / P-notes provide liquidity since they are transferable instruments. P-note holders are permitted to transfer the instruments to other investors, creating layers of intermediaries. In this manner, the actual beneficial owner remains anonymous. This anonymity allows unregulated activities, such as money laundering, terror funding and round-tripping, that can contribute to high market volatility.  \n\nAre P-notes Regulated?\n\nIn 2003, SEBI introduced P-notes in India to boost foreign investment inflow. By 2007, SEBI put a partial ban on the issuance of ODIs, after realising certain major loopholes in their trade. SEBI does not have any direct link with the P-note holders, and therefore there are no regulations governing their dealing. However, SEBI regulates the FIIs, commonly foreign banks, that issue the P-notes and hold positions in Indian securities.\n\nIn 2017, SEBI banned P-notes carrying derivatives (like futures, options, warrants etc.) as an underlying instrument. It also restricted the use of P-notes to only one-to-one hedging in equity. SEBI is reluctant to put a complete ban on ODIs as it would seriously discourage foreign investments in India. However, SEBI is moving towards implementing a stricter compliance framework with regard to ODIs. \n\nConditions for the issuance of ODIs were introduced under the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations 2019 (FPI Regulations). The foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) must disclose all information about the parties involved and comply with ‘know your client’ rules. The P-note holders are subjected to a diligence process. ODIs can only be issued to entities regulated by a foreign regulatory authority. \n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn the 2023 budget, the finance minister announced offshore derivative contracts to be valid. This development in the offshore derivative market is only restricted to the GIFT City, IFSC being developed in Gujarat. Outside the IFSC, the ODIs will continue to be governed by the FPI Regulations.\n\nRecognising offshore derivative contracts as valid will allow full-fledged use of P-notes in the IFSC, including derivatives as underlying instruments and other forms of ODIs. The budget has also announced a tax exemption on the distribution of income received from hedging P-note securities to non-resident investors (restricted only to the offshore banking units set up in the IFSC). Earlier, there used to be a double taxation on the same income on the issuance of ODIs, first on the income received from the position held on securities underlying in P-notes, and second when such income was distributed to the client investor. \n\nNow, FIIs are exempted from taxation on income distributed to non-resident investors. This exemption will attract the foreign banks set up in GIFT City to issue P-notes. The rationale behind taxation for issuance of ODIs in the Indian markets is that they are considered as owners of the underlying securities, and the identity of the actual beneficial owner of the P-notes is unknown due to their anonymity. In order to give effect to these budget announcements, amendments are yet to be brought in the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act 1956 and International Financial Services Centres Authority Act 2019. \n\nSuggestions\n\nThe importance of foreign capital inflow cannot be challenged, however, to weed out the illegal channels, some changes in the present regulatory framework may need to be incorporated. \n\nDue to easy liquidity and transferability of P-notes, transfer trails are difficult to track, thereby encouraging round-tripping of fund. It is important to devise a mechanism to track the ultimate beneficial owner. The United States Securities Exchange Commission in order to prevent round-tripping has a ‘distribution compliance period’, wherein the exempted securities cannot be resold to a US person until the said period ends. Such measures are needed to restrict the transferability of ODIs in offshore markets.\n\nThe recent developments, even though restricted to the IFSC, may impact the markets as the FIIs will now move to set up in the GIFT City. SEBI and IFSC can create a comprehensive framework for the regulated operation of P-notes in India. Additionally, to achieve the goal of boosting foreign capital inflow in India, SEBI can ease the requirements that will allow more foreign investors to directly register with SEBI. In this manner, investors can directly deal in Indian securities with minimal regulatory hassles.\n\nConclusion\n\nODIs are crucial instruments for any financial market, for driving the foreign capital inflows and encouraging investments. However, they are equally difficult to regulate due to the nature of their transactions. SEBI has remained cautious to not introduce any major amendments, to avoid any sharp reactions in the market. This move to recognise ODIs as valid will drive the FPIs to get registered in the GIFT City. While the recent announcement is a welcome step for foreign investors, this move by the government can prove to be counter-productive, if not dealt with caution. The upcoming amendments need to be brought in with a comprehensive approach so as to deal with any undesired activities in the future. \nODISEBIP-NotesFPI\nCorporate Law\n237 views\n1 like.

        "title": "SEBI’s Proposed Amendments for AIFs: Evaluating the Enhanced Governance Mechanism",
        "content": "Shreya Singh\nJul 21\n6 min read\nSEBI’s Proposed Amendments for AIFs: Evaluating the Enhanced Governance Mechanism\n[Shreya is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nOver the past decade, the alternative investment funds (AIFs) regime in India has experienced substantial growth. AIF is commonly understood as a regulatory term encompassing venture capital and private equity funds, which pool investor funds for investment purposes. Private equity investments in India reached a total of $44 billion between 2015 and 2020, with an upward trend in average deal size from $40 million to $65 million. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), responsible for overseeing AIFs, has prioritized making regular revisions to the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 (AIF Regulations) with an aim to foster transparency and enhance various other aspects of the regulations. Most recently, on 18 May 2023, the SEBI published a consultation paper outlining several proposed amendments to the regulations to further strengthen the existing governance mechanism of the AIFs.\n\nWhat the Consultation Paper Entails\n\nBorrowing for Category I and Category II AIFs\n\nCurrently, Category I and Category II AIFs are allowed to borrow funds solely for their day-to-day operational needs. They can leverage up to 4 times a year, at most 10% of the available funds for investments in the AIF. However, each borrowing instance should not exceed 30 days.\n\nSEBI’s proposal to establish a regulatory umbrella on borrowing for investments is a positive development for the AIF industry. It emphasizes that such borrowing should be considered a last resort, prompted only by delays or defaults in investor drawdowns. The proposal also highlights the importance of promptly disclosing the terms of such borrowing to investors, ensuring transparency and accountability in the borrowing practices of Category I and Category II AIFs. This step will contribute significantly to establishing a transparent and responsible borrowing framework for these AIF categories.\n\nHowever, SEBI’s proposed borrowing modalities may present implementation challenges and hinder the acceptance and utilization of the proposed flexibility. For example, charging the cost of borrowing only to investors who delay or default on drawdown notices, and limiting borrowed funds to a maximum of 10% of the investment opportunity, may not be operationally efficient. This threshold could restrict the ability of an AIF to raise sufficient funds for specific investment opportunities, particularly if an investor has committed more than 10% of the total corpus but cannot fulfil the drawdown notice. \n\nIn such a situation, even if the AIF has the capacity to borrow 10% of the total investment amount for a specific opportunity, it might still face difficulties in gathering sufficient funds to seize that opportunity. Consequently, the AIF may be compelled to forego such investment prospects. It becomes crucial for the managers of Category I and Category II AIFs to explore alternative approaches to address these limitations and bridge the gaps effectively. Additionally, Category I and Category II AIFs, which primarily invest in unlisted securities, carry high illiquidity risks. To prevent excessive and frequent leverage, SEBI proposed to implement a cooling-off period between borrowing periods for such AIFs, similar to the requirement for AIFs dealing with credit default swaps.\n\nDematerialization of assets / investments of AIFs\n\nAfter considering the suggestions put forth by the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC) and taking into account the public feedback received on the consultation paper regarding the “Dematerialization of Units of AIFs” issued by SEBI on 3 February 2023, the SEBI, during its meeting on 29 March 2023, approved the proposal to make it compulsory for AIFs to issue units in dematerialized form. This decision aims to facilitate easier monitoring and administration by stakeholders and provide investor protection against operational and fraud risks. Additionally, recognizing that the AIF industry is an advanced and rapidly expanding sector, it is deemed appropriate to introduce the mandatory dematerialization requirement for AIF assets. SEBI is proposing that all AIFs maintain their investments in a digital format unless a specific type of investment cannot be converted into a digital form. The objective is to create a more efficient and secure process. In cases where an AIF has a controlling stake in a company for existing investments, they may be granted a grace period of 6 months to transition to digital holdings. This approach aims to streamline operations and enhance the overall security of AIF investments. \n\nSEBI, on 21 June 2023 via a circular titled “Issuance of Units of AIFs in Dematerialized Form” introduced this amendment to the Regulation 10(aa) of the AIF Regulations, stating that AIFs shall issue units in dematerialized form subject to the conditions specified by SEBI, in the specified time frame. All the units already issued must be dematerialized for the schemes of AIF with corpus less than or equal to INR 500 crore by 31 October 2023 and for schemes of AIF with corpus more than INR 500 crore by 30 April 2024. Additionally, units are to be issued only in dematerialized form from 1 November 2023 and 1 May 2024 onwards, respectively. \n\nMandating the appointment of custodian for AIFs\n\nAs per Regulation 20(11) of the AIF Regulations, only Category I and Category II AIFs with a corpus of less than INR 500 crore and not engaged in credit default swaps are not obligated to appoint a custodian. According to data provided by AIFs to SEBI as of March 31 2023, approximately 90% of the total investments made by all AIFs are held by AIFs that have a custodian. It is worth noting that the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations 2020 also require portfolio managers to appoint a custodian for the securities they manage or administer.\n\nTo ensure independent oversight of AIF investments, SEBI has proposed that custodians of AIFs should assume similar responsibilities to those applicable to custodians of foreign venture capital undertakings and foreign portfolio investors.\n\nMaximum extension of tenure by large value fund for accredited investors\n\nIn 2021, SEBI introduced the concept of 'Accredited Investors', who are well-informed or well-advised about investment products, in the Indian securities market. SEBI also established the concept of large venture fund (LVF), an AIF scheme where each investor is an accredited investor who at least invests INR 70 crore. Certain flexibilities were also granted to accredited investors and LVFs. Currently, LVFs can extend their investment tenure for up to 2 years with the approval of at least 2/3rd of the unit holders. Additionally, LVFs can further extend their tenure beyond 2 years if they meet the conditions specified by SEBI and comply with the terms of the contribution agreement and other fund documents. However, upon the expiration of the tenure or extended tenure, the AIF scheme must be fully liquidated within one year, following the AIF Regulations.\n\nFurthermore, SEBI recently introduced a framework that allows AIFs to address unliquidated investments by either selling them to a new scheme of the same AIF, called the liquidation scheme, or distributing the unliquidated investments in-kind, subject to approval from 75% of the investors by value and in the prescribed manner. SEBI has proposed to provide the option of a liquidation scheme to all AIF schemes, including LVFs, and therefore, it was deemed necessary to align the tenure extension of LVFs with that provided for other AIF schemes.\n\nMandating the renewal of registration of AIFs\n\nAccording to Regulation 3(7) of the AIF Regulations, the certificate of registration granted to an AIF is valid indefinitely as long as the AIF remains operational and does not surrender the certificate. Presently, there is no obligation to pay a renewal fee to maintain the validity of the registration certificate. However, it has been observed that certain AIFs continue to hold their registration certificate despite not engaging in any fundraising or investment activities in their schemes for an extended period of time. The existence of inactive registration certificates has raised specific concerns and issues.\n\nSEBI suggests the introduction of renewal fees, which is equivalent to 50% of its applicable registration fee, for AIFs to promote transparency in the market. The proposal stems from the observation that certain AIFs possess licenses without engaging in any activity or raising capital in their schemes. According to the proposal, all AIFs would be obligated to pay a renewal fee for a period of 5 years, commencing within 3 months of the notification being issued.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe aforementioned proposed amendments are designed to reinforce the governance mechanism of AIFs. These proposals aim to establish consistency among all categories of AIFs and improve the overall operation, monitoring, and functioning of AIFs. SEBI has taken proactive measures to update the AIF Regulations and is in the process of suggesting several more changes. The proposals represent a combination of necessary updates to create a more efficient and improved AIF framework. As the AIF Regulations have been in place for over a decade, these ongoing enhancements demonstrate SEBI’s commitment to transforming the AIF regime into a highly efficient and globally competitive one.\nAIFSEBIAccredited InvestorsLarge Venture Fund\nCorporate Law\n118 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Expanding UPSI an Antidote: Reflections on the SEBI Consultation Paper",
        "content": "Akshat Jain\nJul 19\n6 min read\nExpanding UPSI an Antidote: Reflections on the SEBI Consultation Paper\n[Akshat is a student at National Law University Delhi.]\n\nLast month, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) proposed a review of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) to bring greater clarity and uniformity of compliance in the stock markets. The consultation paper now attempts to classify “material events” as UPSI, which was removed from the definition after the report of the Dr TK Vishwanathan committee in 2018. \n\nThe SEBI found that the categorisation of information as UPSI was done in less than a fifth of the cases, prohibiting the securities regulator’s efforts towards curbing insider trading due to the non-categorisation of material information by listed entities.\n\nThis article attempts to explore the drawbacks that the amendment aims to address. It provides further recommendations for categorising information as UPSI to curb insider trading. It undertakes a comprehensive study of international practices. Overall, it explores the legitimacy of the proposed amendment to meet its purported aim, i.e., to curb insider trading in the stock market.\n\nUPSI: (Not to) Disclose?\n\nUPSI, as it stands presently, includes information related to financial results, dividends, changes in capital structure, mergers, demergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals, expansion, and changes in key managerial positions. While the list is not exhaustive, the classification of the provided five events as UPSI is mandated by law.\n\nIn 2018, the regulator removed the words “material events” from the erstwhile definition of UPSI on the recommendation of the SEBI Committee on Fair Market Conduct (FMC). Material events comprise information which is either price sensitive and/or has a bearing on the performance/operation of the listed entity. The committee believed that since material events do not necessarily impact the price of a security, and the definition of UPSI was an “inclusive definition”, there was no need for such an inclusion.\n\nFive years hence, the SEBI has taken a complete turn in an attempt to undo the 2018 amendment. It found that on multiple occasions, information which was price sensitive and should have been classified as a UPSI was not done so. For instance, a SEBI analysis of 1,099 press releases by the top 100 listed companies revealed that only 8% of press releases with more than 2% impact on stock price were classified as UPSI. \n\nThis led to a situation where even if the SEBI detected insider trading by the employee of a company since the information was not classified UPSI by the company, no action could be taken. In essence, the regulator faced a failure by the entities themselves to disclose anything more than the categories explicitly provided in the regulations.\n\nThe proposed amendment attempts to include, for classification as UPSI, any information considered ‘material’ as per the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR). \n\nIt may be recalled that in June 2023, SEBI introduced amendments to the LODR as a response to another consultation paper seeking to streamline the nature of ‘material’ disclosures. It has introduced thresholds for reporting of events where an event or information’s value exceeds a certain threshold. In this respect, the regulator must be lauded for partially responding to criticism by prescribing quantitative “materiality thresholds” to determine events requiring disclosure. However, the amendment continues to ignore qualitative factors which have a bearing on a corporation’s stock price. For instance, events which carry strategic importance and reputational risks and are open to subjective interpretations of 'material'. In effect, the classification of what classifies as “material” can remain subject to the company's interpretation in such cases.\n\nThis has the practical effect of retaining the problem with the erstwhile definition of UPSI, as it further compounds the problem. Entities would now be required to classify all 'material' information as UPSI, and the classification of information as 'material' is ambiguous and left to the company itself. If the company does not want qualitative information to be available to the public, it will discourage companies from classifying information as 'material' in the first place. This would lead to two results. First, it will lead to non-disclosure of qualitative information to the public when the company does not deem it to be ‘material’, and it does not fall within the other four set parameters. Second, it will not be disclosed to the stock exchanges because the information will not be deemed 'material'. \n\nUltimately, the proposed amendment has the potential of retaining the practical effects of eroding investor trust and confidence, increasing market manipulation, and leading to market volatility and unfair trading. It can act as an antidote to the disease it aims to solve, the asymmetry of information in the stock market.\n\nGlobal Comparative Framework: What is UPSI?\n\nIn the United States, the equivalent of the Indian UPSI is material non-public information (MNPI). Rule 10-b5 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act 1934 prohibits officers, directors, and other employees who have access to non-public information from trading on such shares intending to gain a profit. The terms 'material' and 'non-public' have not been explicitly defined. Information is considered material if there is a “substantial likelihood” that a reasonable investor would find it important in deciding. However, there is no bright line rule, and it is contingent upon the circumstances of the case. Further, information is non-public if not disseminated to the marketplace. \n\nInterestingly, the SEC dealt with a similar problem of selective disclosure by issuers of material non-public information almost two decades back. It incorporated Regulation FD, the fair disclosure rule, to address such selective disclosure concerns. It provides that when an entity discloses MNPI to enumerated persons, such as holders of securities and securities market professionals, prompt public disclosure is mandatory. It was seen as a step to address the “integrity” of the US stock markets.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Market Abuse Regulation governs the UPSI equivalent – known as 'insider information'. It is defined as information of a precise nature that has not been made public and relates directly or indirectly to the issuers or financial instruments. If it is made public, it 'would be likely' to significantly affect the prices of those financial instruments or their derivatives. It requires prompt disclosure of any such information. However, the definition of what classifies as 'prompt' remains open to interpretation.\n\nIt follows that even in developed stock markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, there remains ambiguity in assessing materiality and time frames. This leads to substantial discretion with the issuer of the information itself due to the subjective nature of such information.\n Altering UPSI: The Way Forward\n\nTo preserve investor trust and confidence, the definition of UPSI must be explored for revision in the following manner.\n\nRevisiting 'material' under the LODR\n\nIt is critical that the flagged issues with the classification of an event as material, which requires disclosure under the LODR and the proposed regulations, be resolved. SEBI must classify quantifiable marquee indicators for treating a qualitative event as carrying strategic importance or reputational risks. This will ensure that information to both the stock exchange and the investor is disseminated promptly.\n\nEstablishment of statutory disclosure committees\n\nIt is helpful to explore the concept of a statutory disclosure committee within a company, comprising senior management representatives from various departments providing a holistic view of the materiality of business development. It will be responsible for identifying, handling, and disclosing such information based on a data-driven approach to the likelihood of change in stock price. Similar to SEBI’s approach in the consultation paper, an analysis of events likely to have an impact over a set threshold historically must be disclosed. Records and proceedings of such a committee must also be recorded for review by the regulator, including deliberations, decisions, and rationale.\n\nWhistleblower and review mechanism\n\nSEBI must consider a whistleblower mechanism specifically for violation of UPSI disclosure norms. Companies must be required to develop a comprehensive policy, clearly defining types of concerns that can be flagged and the protection and confidentiality measures provided to whistleblowers.\n\nConclusion \n\nIn conclusion, information symmetry with large public corporations remains the need of the hour to ensure and build investor trust and confidence. Expanded disclosure requirements have always been met with backlash, and there is likely displeasure with such requirements. SEBI’s move is rather welcome, considering these corporations deal with public money. SEBI’s move to incorporate financial materiality frameworks is welcome. However, the subjectivity of what constitutes 'material' information remains a blurred line regarding information being classified as price sensitive or otherwise, prohibiting disclosure. This is not only within India but in advanced economies as well. Thus, a regular review of such a definition to meet market demand must be made and proposed steps be undertaken.\n\n\nSEBILODRUPSIMaterial\nCorporate Law\n159 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Understanding SEBI’s Draft Regulatory Framework for ESG Rating Providers",
        "content": "Deepta Ramakrishnan\nJul 16\n5 min read\nUnderstanding SEBI’s Draft Regulatory Framework for ESG Rating Providers\n[Deepta is a student at Tamil Nadu National Law University.]\n\nThe world has witnessed a significant surge in the growth of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing in the last 5 years, with COVID-19 being cited as the main propeller of this trend. This growth can also be attributed to increasing research and evidence suggesting that businesses focusing on ESG issues have superior management teams and experience improved financial returns. In PwC’s Global Investor Survey, 2022, investors placed ESG factors in their top 5 priorities for businesses to deliver. According to Bloomberg, global ESG assets are set to exceed 50 trillion dollars by 2025, comprising more than a third of the projected total assets under management.\n\nAs the influence of ESG investing grows, so does the level of scrutiny it faces, not just from global regulators but also from companies and investors. One area of concern is the limited availability of reliable and consistent ESG data and the lack of regulation for ESG rating providers (ERPs). Yet another issue is the lack of a shared understanding of what an ESG rating measures – whether the company’s impact on the world or the world’s impact on the financial future of the company. For instance, MSCI upgraded McDonald’s Corp.’s ratings, stating that the company had positive environmental practices, despite McDonald’s generating more greenhouse gas emissions than some entire countries. This decision was based on MSCI’s conclusion that climate change does not pose a financial risk to McDonald’s. However, this contradicts the “sustainable investment” connotation that ESG investing is often associated with in popular discourse. \n\nThe need to regulate ERPs was felt by the IOSCO, which in its final report on ERPs in 2021, highlighted the need for regulators to focus greater attention on the activities of ESG rating and data products providers within their jurisdiction. Following the release of the IOSCO report, the SEBI published a consultation paper on 24 January 2022, outlining the concerns surrounding the unregulated ESG rating industry and proposed the creation of a more reliable, comparable, and interpretable ESG rating system that adheres to emerging global practices. Consequently, a draft framework was released on 22 February 2023, and approved by SEBI board on 29 March 2023. \n\nThe Proposed Regulatory Framework\n\nAt the outset, the framework seeks to bring ERPs within the ambit of the SEBI Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) Regulations 1999, through an amendment to include a chapter for ERPs. Relying on its experience in regulating CRAs, SEBI wants to have an enforceable supervisory framework to govern ERPs, as opposed to a less stringent voluntary code of conduct. More countries are following suit, with the European Commission recently announcing its proposal to control instances of “greenwashing” by requiring ERPs, including those outside the EU, to obtain certification from the EU’s financial regulator. Some key features of SEBI’s draft framework are discussed below.\n\nUnverified controversies\n\nSEBI’s framework proposes preparing a “core ESG rating” based on Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) disclosures made by the company. However, it also allows ERPs to undertake an independent assessment of companies and provide ratings and commentaries based on information and controversies not verified by the company. Industry stakeholders generally concur that unverified controversies should not exert influence on the core ESG rating, and accordingly, the framework does not allow unverified controversies to affect the core rating. It would be beneficial if SEBI also provided certain guidelines on how these commentaries and observations are to be prepared by ERPs and to what degree they can continue on unverified information, despite it being presented as an additional commentary.\n\nDivergence in ratings \n\nOne major issue with ESG ratings is that they are rarely consistent across different ERPs. This gives rise to a number of challenges – it defeats the purpose of having an ESG Rating in the first place because investors do not know which rating to consider, it does not incentivize companies to work on improving their rating due to “mixed signals” from ERPs, and the divergence in ratings also hinders the effective pricing of companies’ ESG performance in the market. Acknowledging these challenges, SEBI has proposed that a detailed report be published along with the rating articulating the rationale behind the rating. While this will not help in resolving the problem of divergent ratings across ERPs, it would enable investors to understand the reasoning behind the ratings they purchase. It is also true that different investors have different priorities and therefore, in a way, diversity in perspectives can also be advantageous.\n\nBusiness model\n\nThe consultation paper proposes two business models. The “issuer pay” model guarantees the widespread dissemination of ratings to all investors without imposing any monetary burden on them. Nevertheless, the model engenders inherent conflict of interest issues since the ERP derives its revenue from the issuer. At the heart of the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis lies a nefarious web of complex securities used to finance subprime mortgages, the proliferation of which was enabled, in no small part, by the actions of CRAs. This was a turning point for regulators across the globe in realizing the inherently flawed nature of the issuer pays business model, as it creates an incentive for CRAs to pander to the demands of the issuing company rather than exercising their fiduciary duty to investors. \n\nThe “subscriber pay” model, on the other hand, would ensure that the ratings are paid for by those who wish to avail it and thus presents fewer potential conflict of interest issues compared to the “issuer-pay” model. However, the reports are usually expensive, thus posing a barrier for institutional investors, impeding their access to such information. It has been proposed by SEBI that the permissible business models for ERPs in India include either the issuer-pays or the subscriber-pays model, while hybrid models shall not be permitted, to ensure that investors are not misleaded. \n\nAccreditation\n\nAll entities wishing to get accredited as an ERP will fall under two categories. Category I ERPs would be subjected to stringent net worth requirements of INR 5 crores to be maintained at all points of time, with INR 10 crores as the requirement at the time of making the application, further stipulating that the promoter shall maintain a minimum shareholding of 26%. Category II ERPs, on the other hand, are required to maintain a minimum net worth of INR 10 lakhs, with INR 20 lakhs at the time of making the application, along with comparatively lenient eligibility and infrastructure criteria, with an option to have employees work from home as well. This is a welcome step, as the imposition of high capital requirements for a developing service may hinder new entrants, since ERPs can be operated as not-for-profit agencies or be smaller firms that incorporate AI. However, there is apprehension regarding the possible attribution of inferior connotations to agencies falling under the second category.\n\nConclusion\n\nESG investing has garnered considerable attention and criticism recently, with figures like Elon Musk calling it the “devil” due to tobacco companies outperforming Tesla in ESG ratings. US Senators are arguing that this investment approach could negatively impact average Americans. At this juncture, it has become necessary to prioritize further research aimed at understanding how ERPs evaluate companies and how ESG investing can positively influence climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nA recent study has demonstrated the feasibility of recalibrating ESG ratings by implementing a standardized taxonomy to guide data analysis. Therefore, while the establishment of a framework governing ERPs is a welcome step from the SEBI, it is recommended that India adopt a green taxonomy framework similar to the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This will help in the assessment of whether an economic activity aligns with environmental sustainability objectives. Implementing this will mitigate instances of “greenwashing” often connected with ESG investments, ultimately redirecting capital flows toward a more sustainable economy.\nESGERPESG Rating ProvidersBRSRSEBI\nCorporate Law\n375 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "The Turbulence of GoFirst: Unriddling the Insolvency Puzzle and Implications",
        "content": "Satwik Mohapatra\nJul 15\n6 min read\nThe Turbulence of GoFirst: Unriddling the Insolvency Puzzle and Implications\n[Satwik is a student at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe idea of leasing aircrafts is appealing to airlines. This offers them a lot of operational flexibility and cashflow benefits. In India alone, around 80% of the commercial fleet is leased, compared to 53% globally. India has been trying to bring the business for aircraft leasing from abroad to India by introducing projects like ‘Project Rupee Raftaar’, which is aimed at developing leasing and financing structures in the country and providing incentives for registering aircraft leasing in Gift City, Gujarat. This sheds light on how important aircraft leasing is to India. It is against this backdrop, the ruling of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has raised distress signals for the international lessors. \n\nThe NCLAT, in the case of  SMBC Aviation Capital v. Interim Resolution Professional of Go Airlines (India), Abhilash Lal, upheld the order of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitting the application under Section 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code) which gives the defaulter the power to initiate voluntary insolvency. Furthermore, the NCLT also imposed a moratorium. This judgement has wide ramifications on aircraft leasing in India. The author has analyzed the tribunal’s verdict from the point of view of aircraft lessors and discussed varied implications.\n\nBrief Facts\n\nGo Airlines (India) Limited (renamed to GoFirst), the corporate debtor (CD), was engaged in low-cost airline business. The CD has defaulted in the payment towards aircraft lessors to the tune of INR 26,000 crores.\n\nThis led the CD to file for a voluntary insolvency application under Section 10 of the Code before the NCLT. The aircraft lessors, who make up operational creditors (OC), resisted the application on the ground that the application for voluntary insolvency has been filed by the CD with fraudulent and malicious intent. Furthermore, no notice was issued to the creditors to object to the current application. \n\nThe NCLT in its order held that there is no expressed provision which states that notices have to be issued to the creditors while filing an application for voluntary insolvency. Furthermore, while adjudicating on the question of challenging the application under Section 65 of the Code which deals with fraudulent initiation of insolvency, the NCLT concluded that the same could be dealt with post initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). In consequence, the CD came under the ambit of the moratorium imposed under Section 14 of the Code. \n\nThis order was challenged by the lessors before the NCLAT on various grounds. First, it is necessary to issue notice to OC before admitting a Section 10 application. Second, NCLT must give opportunity to OC to file application under Section 65 of the Code before admission of an application for voluntary insolvency. Furthermore, the OC contended that the moratorium imposed via the NCLT’s order is not applicable on the aircrafts leased by the lessors as the lease agreement has already been terminated prior to the admission of the application under Section 10 of the Code and pursuant to the termination, the lessors are entitled to claim possession of the aircraft. \n\nThe NCLAT ruled that there is no obligation on the part of CD to issue any notice to the creditors. Furthermore, the bench observed that it is open to the creditors to file an application under Section 65 of the Code as has been granted by the NCLT.\n\nMoreover, the NCLAT opined that the remaining issues must be addressed by the NCLT and granted the lessors the liberty to file applications under Section 60(5) of the Code. The NCLAT further upheld the order passed by the NCLT. \n\nUnderstanding Aircraft Leasing and Its Interplay with Insolvency\n\nAircraft leasing involves a lot of cross-border transactions and for this, there are in place principles which protect the right of the lessors. The Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, also known as the Cape Town Convention (CTC), is one such convention which is specific to aircraft leasing. \n\nThe CTC has provisions relating to insolvency. The provisions include acknowledgement of insolvency proceedings in various jurisdictions, and an insolvency administrator who oversees the assets of the debtor. Furthermore, the Convention further provides for a waiting period, ranging from 30-60 days, during which the creditors cannot exercise rights. Additionally, the Article XI of Aircraft Protocol of CTC provides two alternatives to creditors, i.e., either to take back the possession of the aircraft after the expiration of the waiting period or allow the insolvency administrator to decide to either give up the aircraft or continue using it while making lease payments under the lease agreement. Moreover, the debtor or the administrator has to preserve the value of the equipment. These provisions are put in place to safeguard the rights of the creditors and does not include any order or action which might delay the remedies exercisable by the creditors. \n\nCurrently, India has merely acceded to CTC and not ratified it. The insolvency and bankruptcy regime, i.e., the Code takes primacy. \n\nAnalyzing the Verdict\n\nThe initiation of CIRP leads to initiation of moratorium. The intent behind imposition of moratorium is to safeguard the assets of CD and to stop any recovery of the asset by the creditors or the lessors. This approach was also followed by NCLT while admitting application of voluntary insolvency by the CD. However, this has wide implications. \n\nImposition of the moratorium says that the lessors cannot take possession of the aircrafts for a minimum of 6 months, which may also extend further. Additionally, there are a lot of delays in resolution of debt-ridden companies. Such a delay could depreciate the value of aircrafts. Moreover, the aircrafts will stay on the ground unused instead of being leased to a stronger airline. Furthermore, it is a settled position that delay in resolution diminishes the value of the CD’s asset and hinders successful resolution. Additionally, creditors apart from the lessors might seize the aircrafts to recover their dues. There also exists apprehension about receiving a huge haircut. According to Care Ratings’ Report (November 2022), lenders have been taking haircuts of around 70% implying a low recovery rate of 30.8%. \n\nThe idea of the lessors to terminate the lease agreement is to repossess their aircraft before the airline gets into insolvency. The precedent that has been set by the Supreme Court in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited v. Amit Gupta is that termination of a contract with a CD which would lead to the death of the CD is impermissible. There have been requests from lessors to deregister 45 aircrafts from the 57 in the fleet of the CD. Such a move will severely hamper the resolution of the CD. On the other hand, moratorium is not applicable on the assets of the CD of which they are not in rightful possession. It is against this backdrop that NCLT must resolve this conundrum.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the confidence of international aircraft lessors has taken a hit after imposition of moratorium. The aviation leasing watchdog, Aviation Working Group (AWG), has put India on watchlist with a negative outlook because of non-compliance with aircraft repossession norms. Furthermore, this could translate into higher risk premiums and higher lease rentals for airlines. Additionally, this could put a dent in India’s progress in the leasing sector. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe main issue which revolves around the insolvency of GoFirst is the possession of aircraft. The decision will play a huge role in shaping the aircraft leasing sector. The NCLT while admitting the application of insolvency should have taken a middle road, where both the rights of the lessors and lessee are protected. Alternatively, there could have been arrangements that allowed half possession of leased aircraft with the lessors, allowing them to generate revenue by leasing the aircrafts to other airlines and the other half could have stayed with the CD. Furthermore, provisions can be made to pay the lessors the amount that is due on a current basis during moratorium as has been done in the case of Rave Scans Private Limited.\n\nAdditionally, the current insolvency regime is at crossroads with the CTC, especially when it comes to moratorium. It seems to have unintentionally contradicted the agreed position on the convention, depriving the aircraft lessors of some important rights. In other jurisdictions, like that of the USA, the UK and Qatar, the insolvency regime runs parallel to principles set out in the convention. This essentially plays a huge role in promoting confidence among the lessors and provides uniformity. With India trying to bring aircraft leasing business to India, it is imperative that they must ratify CTC and align it with the current laws. There have previously been efforts to put in place an Cape Town Convention Act which will reduce risks related to assets and further assist in financial leasing. However, with the case of SpiceJet, Jet Airways and now GoFirst, India needs to fast track the process.\nGoFirstInsolvencyIBCCorporate Insolvency Resolution ProcessCorporate Debtor\nInsolvency Law\n178 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Navigating the Shift: SARs as a New Frontier For Employee Incentives In India",
        "content": "Amika Choudhry, Simran Srivastava\nJul 14\n6 min read\nNavigating the Shift: SARs as a New Frontier For Employee Incentives In India\n[Amika and Simran are students at Institute of Law, Nirma University and Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar, respectively.]\n\nIndia is the upcoming hub for global investments, and this has resulted in soaring valuations leading to an increased demand for executive talent with continuous exploration of incentive schemes in order to retain skilled employees.\n\nThe most common form of employee incentive is employee stock option plans (ESOPs), which ensures that all employees work towards improving the profitability of the company. To elucidate, if a share is at a certain price at the beginning of the employment period of a person, then at the end of a stipulated holding period, in the desirable event that the company goes into profit and the price of the share rises, the employee can purchase the share at the previous lower price and make a profit by selling it at the current price. Despite being the most common form of employee incentive scheme, ESOPs have adverse issues. From diluting the shareholders’ holdings to limitations regarding issuance to promotors, ESOPs put a cap on companies, compelling companies to experiment with other schemes which suit the commercial Indian backdrop.\n\nA stock appreciation right (SAR) is one such framework that the companies prefer. SAR is not defined under the Companies Act 2013, but the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations 2014 defines it. SAR is an entitlement given to the SAR grantee allowing them to receive the value or growth of a specific number of shares in a company. When the SAR is exercised, the grantee may choose to receive the value of appreciation in either cash or additional company shares. The precise intricacies of these rights may vary, contingent upon the stipulations given in the SAR plan / grant agreement. Thus, while the entities still await its regulatory clarifications, the brighter side is that no law in India bars or puts any restrictions on companies adopting this scheme. This article thus aims to delve into studying the legality of SARs as an alternative option to ESOPs.\n\nESOP v/s SAR: Finding the Alternative Trade-off\n\nESOPs are given to permanent employees of the company as per the Companies Act 2013, removing from its ambit the option of issuance to promoters, whereas SARs may be issued to third parties, covering advisors and consultants of group companies. While the issuance of SARs to unlisted companies is not regulated, to surmount the issues of restrictions imposed on ESOP by the Companies Act 2013, companies often resort to issuing SARs instead. Furthermore, with the Companies (Amendment) Act 2017, Section 194 of the Act was omitted, thus permitting the issuance of the said option to independent directors or promotors. When issued by unlisted companies, SARs mandate no minimum vesting period and need no mandatory administration from the compensation committee. They are equity based and they provide the employee with the price of appreciation of the company stocks over an established time period, without the employee requiring to pay any exercise price.\n\nUnlike ESOPs, companies issue SARs to give appreciation in the value of equity shares, leaving the shareholding pattern unaltered. From the perspective of an employee, ESOPs might lose their value if there is no buyer but in case of SARs, the value is offered by the company itself thus qualifying as a cash bonus. Thus, in times after the global pandemic where attrition level is at an all-time high across all sectors, companies are focusing on incentivising employees and experimenting with alternatives such as SARs being one of them.\n\nAligning SARs in line with Global Best Practices: Will the Move Suffice?\n\nRegulation 2(1)(gg) of SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits Sweat Equity) Regulations 2021 defines SARs as “a right given to a SAR grantee entitling him to receive appreciation for a specified number of shares of the company where the settlement of such appreciation may be made by way of cash payment or shares of the company”. This resolution is applicable to the listed entities and it states that all employee benefit schemes must be offered after the passing of a special resolution by the shareholders. However, a grey area is present in terms of issuance of SARs by unlisted companies which is recognised by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in the Company Law Committee (CLC) Report published in March 2022. It notes:\n\n“The Committee was of the opinion that RSUs and SARs should be recognised under CA-13 through enabling provisions. If these schemes require the issue of further securities by the company, their issuance must be allowed only after approval of the shareholders through a special resolution.\"\n\n\"However, where the settlement of such rights does not involve offer or conversion into securities, approval by shareholders need not be mandated.”\n\nThe said report also proposed to amend Section 62(1) of the Companies Act 2013 to permit additional employee compensation schemes which are linked to the company’s equity. Thus, it aims to give legal recognition to the issuance of SARs. It proposed that cash-settled SARs can be aligned with the existing law and its issuance should be subject to board approval. Further, while issuing SARs settled in cash, the approval of the shareholders of the company by way of special resolution would be required. It was also recommended by the CLC that for offering and issuance of SARs, a general offer on an annual basis should be allowed which would remove the need for multiple approvals every time such a scheme is proposed.\n\nHowever, CLC only provided a mechanism to remove the prevailing ambiguity regarding its legality and failed to propose any scope under the prevailing provision. The report narrowly emphasised on the regulation of equity linked/ settled SARs rather than providing recommendations on SARs settled by way of cash. It must also be emphasised that the proposed recommendations were silent on the details of transferability and the minimum vesting term of SARs which would further limit the scope of listed companies from issuance of SARs. Further, the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations 2021 put forth that the employees holding an SAR cannot have the entitlement to receive dividends or vote or enjoy the benefits available to a shareholder in respect of an SAR.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that after the amendment to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules 2019 (NDI Rules), equity settled SARs are given recognition, and they must comply with the NDI Rules. The changes in the definition of 'share based employee benefits' pave the way for SARs to be recognised as an incentive scheme as well. \n\nTax Implications\n\nConsidering that the suggested amendments are brought into effect, there could potentially be a higher occurrence of unlisted companies issuing SARs. Nevertheless, the frequency of such issuances is also heavily affected by the activities and responsibilities undertaken by the grantee within the company since the tax implications of SARs differ depending upon the same. In case of equity settled SARs, “the value of equity shares issued or transferred to the employee as on date of exercise” minus “the amount recovered from the employee” will be considered as perquisite value as per the Income Tax Act 1961 and shall be taxed as the salary of the employee. This tax is calculated based on the applicable salary tax rate for the individual employee at the time when SARs are exercised. Furthermore, upon the sale of the equity shares, the employee must pay tax on the capital gain made on this sale. In case of cash-settled SARs, the appreciated value maybe be given the treatment equivalent to a bonus payment being subject to withholding taxes at the applicable rates. Section 36 of the Income Tax Act 1961 provides that bonus payment is eligible for tax deduction from the company’s income when it is actually paid and not on an accrual basis. In situations wherein the cash payment is received from a person not being the beneficiary's employer, be it a consultant or an advisor, the amount received upon SARs settlement will still be taxable, albeit classified as income from other sources.\n\nThe Way Ahead\n\nThe dynamic nature of law and society is directly proportional, therefore formulating and accommodating new legislation is only natural and imperative. In today’s highly volatile market, it is pertinent to realise strategies that would aid in keeping things stable while benefitting each involved party. Companies want to be more flexible with their incentive schemes to attract employee loyalty and in turn, the welfare of the company. Given the benefits of SARs, the authors concur with the widely opined statement that the SARs should be recognised under the Companies Act 2013 as well as regulated according to the requirement of the Indian industry. \n\nThe requisition of implementation of such a scheme in India is abundance of time. To eliminate any hardships that the corporate world would face in this shift to new regulations, a two-year transition period is recommended. In addition to this, it is also recommended that one umbrella regulation encompassing all employee benefit schemes, namely ESOPs, SARs, employee stock purchase scheme, and employee welfare schemes, should be formulated. While we realise that this is a new concept in India, SAR has been prominently accepted and implemented globally which could further assist the formulation of requisite regulations by taking inspiration from such countries. \n\nConclusion\n\nDespite certain discrepancies at an early stage, incorporating SARs into the legal framework of the Companies Act 2013 would constitute a beneficial stride, fostering increased investment in new and small companies. It is well-known that the Indian industry may display a certain interest in exploring the effectiveness and adoption of the relatively underutilized SARs. If implemented wisely, it can be potentially used as an effective instrument to achieve objectives related to the companies’ as well as the employees’ well-being.\nESOPsSARsEmployeeIncentiveCompanies ActSEBI\nCorporate Law\n•\nLabour Law\n157 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Renting of RA Licences by Fin-fluencers: An Outcome of Over-regulation and Ambiguity in Regulations?",
        "content": "Siddharth Sengupta, Manya Sharma\nJul 13\n6 min read\nRenting of RA Licences by Fin-fluencers: An Outcome of Over-regulation and Ambiguity in Regulations?\n[Siddharth and Manya are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently imposed its first-ever penalty on a financial influencer (fin-fluencer) for providing investment advice without acquiring registration under SEBI regulations. This action in itself was a very significant development that came in the backdrop of the steeply rising number of unregistered fin-fluencers.\n\nHowever, soon after this announcement, a very different kind of problem has emerged. Fin-fluencers, in order to avoid being penalised by SEBI, have started renting Research Analyst (RA) licences by hiring registered RAs to their companies and including their names in all reports; the issue being that the advice is not delivered by the registered RAs but by the same person who has been providing advice without the requisite license.\n\nFin-fluencers have to mandatorily obtain registration under one of two SEBI regulations in order to lawfully give stock market-related advice in public forums, and renting out the licences bypasses the entire gamut of qualification and certification requirements under both sets of regulations. This can allow any person having insufficient knowledge to provide advice, following which can have a severely detrimental effect on the investors.\n\nThis article tries to identify the deep-rooted problems of ‘over-regulation’ and ‘lack of clarity’ in the SEBI regulations, which is the primary reason for several of the recent fin-fluencer-related issues. It also provides possible solutions that can be explored by SEBI in order to resolve these critical problems.\n Current Regulatory Framework\n\nOver the past 5-6 years, fin-fluencers have grown exponentially in the country, providing advisory services to potential investors primarily through social media platforms. Depending on the nature of their content, they fall under the purview of either the SEBI Research Analysts Regulations 2014 (RA Regulations) or the SEBI Investment Advisors Regulations 2013 (IA Regulations).\n\nIn India, the RA Regulations focus on RAs and the individuals employed by research entities. These analysts prepare and publish research reports and provide recommendations to the public regarding the buying or selling of securities. On the other hand, the IA Regulations govern Investment Advisors (IAs) that engage in the business of offering advice related to the purchase, sale, or dealing in securities and other investment products. IAs and RAs have very similar functions, the difference being that the former typically cater to individual clients, and their advice is not widely available to the general public.\n\nWhile the IA Regulations and the RA Regulations were enacted to safeguard investor interests and disseminate financial knowledge to the public, they have become increasingly burdensome to comply with. The regulations are also a hindrance to potential earnings for the registered advisors.\n\nBoth IAs and RAs, as well as individuals employed by them, are required to meet certain criteria outlined in the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations 2008. Additionally, they must obtain certification from the National Institute of Securities Markets to conduct their activities within India. Both IAs and RAs must maintain a clear distinction between their trading and advisory activities. Their personal trading activities are limited and highly monitored. Further, to obtain a license under either of the IA Regulations or the RA Regulations, the applicant must have a professional qualification and at least five years of experience. \n\nEven after complying with these requirements, in the end, complete discretion lies with the board to reject or accept the application. Complying with this plethora of requirements is impractical and burdensome for independent and small-scale IAs and RAs as the ultimate outcome is completely unpredictable.\n\nThe regulations are proving to be counter-productive, as the fin-fluencers are operating without any licenses and earning significantly higher than registered RAs and IAs. This can be seen especially after the surge in new demat accounts in 2020 where the amount of publicly available investment advice by fin-fluencers has skyrocketed while the number of registered IAs has stagnated.\n\nWhile financial advisory plays an important role in the growth of a market, recommendations by unregistered entities on social media is potentially dangerous. Unregistered fin-fluencers often provide biased advice, for promotion, on buying/selling securities, without disclosing their affiliations. This can cause a detrimental effect on investors’ confidence in the market, which will discourage investments.\n ‘Renting’ of RA Licences\n\nTo limit the problem posed by unregistered and unqualified advisory on social media platforms, SEBI is imposing heavy penalties any violations of the RA Regulations or the IA Regulations by fin-fluencers.\n\nFin-fluencers argue that their attempts to register are often rejected due to vague reasons such as lack of credibility and expertise, as the registration requirements under the IA Regulations and the RA Regulations are too restrictive and lack clarity. Even after getting registered, there are various limitations on their personal trading activities and strict compliance rules which discourage registration. For example, after successful registration, the IAs have to maintain a record of every piece of advice given with the rationale behind it, along with telephone records, messages, and emails, for inspection.\n\nSEBI has also recently come up with the Advertisement Code to strictly regulate the forms of communications through which registered IAs and RAs provide investment-related advice or research analysis.\n\nTo avoid complying with these regulatory hurdles, a new trend has emerged where fin-fluencers have started \"renting\" RA licenses for a fee instead of obtaining registration with SEBI. By hiring registered RAs and using their registration numbers while giving advice, these fin-fluencers can continue their activities “legally” under the disguise of a rented licence, without having to comply with SEBI’s registration requirements. The registered research analysts and entities rent licences to these fin-fluencers because of their wide reach in public and high popularity, in return they receive around 20% of their earnings as a fee. The fin-fluencers can also use their own name while giving advice along with the registered trade name, as per a SEBI Circular. This allows them to continue their advisory as usual without any changes. While this practice of license renting is not explicitly prohibited by any regulation, it undermines the very purpose of having the requirement for registration in the first place.\n\nPossible Solutions\n\nIn India, fin-fluencers are still being regulated by the IA Regulations and the RA Regulations established by SEBI a decade ago despite these regulations being originally formulated for stockbrokers and research entities. Due to the rise in the number of fin-fluencers, there is a need for a distinct set of regulations specifically tailored to this group. To address this, SEBI can classify fin-fluencers as a separate category of intermediaries under the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, which will allow SEBI to create new regulations that specifically address the unique challenges faced, and created, by the fin-fluencer community.\n\nSEBI should also consider studying the regulatory frameworks of countries such as the UK and Australia, where the registration processes for RAs are comparatively smoother. \n\nIn the UK, similar restrictions to that in India are imposed on fin-fluencers through the Advertising Standards Authority's Influencer's Guide and the UK Government's Social Media Endorsements Guide. While the UK has similar regulations in place, the process of obtaining a RA license there is comparatively more straightforward, resulting in a higher number of new licensees each year, when compared to India, despite receiving fewer applications.\n\nSimilarly, Australian law deems conducting a financial services business without an Australian Financial Service (AFS) license illegal, as stated in the Corporations Act 2001. Regulatory Guide 244 in Australia also imposes conditions on AFS license holders that are similar to those imposed by SEBI on Indian RAs and IAs. However, despite the similarities in the regulatory frameworks, Australia experiences a higher ratio of new license holders to the total number of applications per year when compared to India due to a much simpler registration process.\n\nThe above examples clearly exhibit the problem of unnecessary hinderances and ambiguity in Indian regulations that create hurdles for obtaining registration, which cannot be attributed only to the harshness or the sheer number of restrictions imposed. To prevent the emergence of new methods of bypassing the registration process, like renting RA licences, it is crucial to address this issue. Simplifying the registration process and reducing unnecessary and vague requirements can encourage more individuals to obtain licenses through legitimate means, thus fostering a transparent and accountable fin-fluencer ecosystem in India.\n Conclusion\n\nThe rise of financial influencers, or fin-fluencers, in India has presented new regulatory challenges for SEBI. The fin-fluencer community in India has a very wide reach among small cities and remote areas where there is a need for financial advisory.  Therefore, it becomes crucial for SEBI to regulate financial advisory given by unregistered and unqualified individuals to a large number of potential investors. \n\nHowever, the current regulatory framework, consisting of the IA Regulations and the RA Regulations, has become burdensome, restrictive and vague, discouraging potential fin-fluencers from obtaining registration. This has led to the emergence of the problematic practice of renting RA licenses, allowing unregistered individuals to provide investment advice without meeting the necessary qualifications.\n\nBy studying and implementing best practices from other regulatory frameworks such as of the UK and Australia, by removing ambiguities from the regulations and by classifying fin-fluencers as a separate category of intermediaries, SEBI can ensure that the individuals providing investment advice are qualified and accountable for their recommendations by preventing circumvention of the law, and create a regulatory environment that safeguards investor interests.\nResearch AnalystInvestment AdvisorSEBIIntermediariesFin-Fluencers\nCorporate Law\n103 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "(Re)Evaluation of the Treatment of Third-Party Security Holders under the IBC",
        "content": "Manav Ganapathy\nJul 9\n6 min read\n(Re)Evaluation of the Treatment of Third-Party Security Holders under the IBC\n[Manav is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nIt is commonplace in financing transactions to see a third-party creating a security interest in favour of a lender for a credit facility extended to the borrower. However, in the event of the insolvency of the provider of security interest, these third-party security holders have not been classified as financial creditors, which would directly impair their ability to participate in the resolution process since they would not be a part of the committee of creditors (CoC) or be allowed to vote on the resolution plans and would most likely diminish their recovery. In light of the same, it becomes important to analyse the trajectory and the development of law in respect of the treatment afforded to third party security holders and discuss the practical implications of the same. \n\nJaypee Infratech and Phoenix ARC: A Step in the Wrong Direction?\n\nUpon perusal of the decisions of the Supreme Court (SC) in Anuj Jain (IRP for Jaypee Infratech Limited) v. Axis Bank Limited (Jaypee Infratech) and Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Ketulbhai Ramubhai Patel, (Phoenix ARC) we see a flawed approach taken in respect of the classification of third-party security holders which overlooks commercial realities and customary banking practices. \n\nIn Jaypee Infratech, the lenders of Jaypee Associates Limited (JAL) had a security interest (through a mortgage) created in their favour by Jaypee Infratech and were not classified as financial creditors by the SC and were rather classified merely as ‘secured creditors’. The SC's reasoning was based on the following: (a) that a financial creditor must prove that the corporate debtor owes a financial debt to such financial creditor which the JAL lenders failed to show; and (b) that a third-party security holder is only interested in realizing the value of its security and not concerned with the revival of a corporate debtor. \n\nIt can be seen that the court has taken a very narrow view of the definition of 'financial debt' under Section 5(8) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) by holding that since there was no disbursement of debt against consideration of time value of money to the lenders, there would not be any financial debt. This is because it is a very well-established position of law that the creation of security for securing the performance of an obligation or payment is inextricably linked to the underlying debt or obligation i.e., debt subsists within the security interest. On the basis of this position, it can be argued that the person creating the security interest is undertaking to repay the debt owed to the creditor to the extent of the security interest and therefore also be considered as a financial creditor of the debtor. In light of the same, such a transaction can be construed to be a guarantee since the third party is intending to discharge the obligation of the debtor to the extent of the security and therefore could classify such interest holders as a financial creditor under Section 5(8)(h) of the IBC.\n\nEven in Phoenix ARC, the SC accepted the line of reasoning adopted in Jaypee Infratech, while refusing to classify the lenders of another entity as financial creditors when they held a security interest through the pledge of shares created by the corporate debtor. Furthermore, the notion that security interest holders are not interested in the revival of the corporate debtor would be misplaced. This is because it assumes that financial creditors would not have highest recovery as their first priority and at the same time assuming that the security interest beneficiary would not want better resolution of the corporate debtor also seems erroneous. Such a decision would render the mortgage/pledgee remediless without any fault on their part. \n\nTherefore, it can be seen that the aforementioned decisions ignore commercial reality of third-party security transactions being commonplace. By classifying beneficiaries of the security interest as merely secured creditors under Section 5(30) of the IBC would leave them out of the decision-making process in respect of the resolution plan and could lead to their security interest being extinguished without them having any say in the same. \n\nAmtek Auto: Filling the Gap and the Practical Challenges\n\nWhile the aforementioned decisions did settle the position on the classification of such beneficiaries, it left the question open with respect to the remedy that they could seek. In the M/s Vistra ITCL (India) Limited v. Dinkar Venkatasubramanian (Amtek Auto), the corporate debtor pledged shares in favour of the appellant for the loan facilities extended by the latter to certain group entities and the said pledge agreement was vaporised under the resolution plan. In this situation, the SC correctly identified the peculiar situation of the security holders i.e., not only were they denied the benefit of realising the security interest but also excluded from the ambit of the decision-making process by not being treated as financial creditors. \n\nSuch a line of argumentation was also adopted by the SC in Jaypee Kensington Boulevard Apartments Welfare Association & Others v. NBCC (India) Limited and Others (Jaypee Kensington), which also held that the extinguishment of a third-party mortgage interest without allowing for their participation was a violation of due process of law. Moreover, in SREI Infrastructure Finance Limited v. Sterling International Enterprises Limited [MA 1584/2018 in CP 402/2018 (NCLT Mumbai)] as well, a violation of natural justice was recognised when the third-party mortgagee was excluded from resolution process by the refusal to classify them as a financial creditor.  \n\nUntil Amtek Auto, the precedents in this regard did not shed light on the treatment to be afforded to the third-party security holders under the Resolution Plan and particularly in Jaypee Kensington the SC restricted its opinion to the fact that a third-party security interest cannot be extinguished without ‘assigning any value’.\n\nHowever, in Amtek Auto, the SC put forth a two-fold solution: (a) the third-party security holders are to be treated as secured creditors by the resolution applicant (RA) which would entitle them to retain the security interest and would be entitled to retain the security proceeds on the sale of the security, and (b) the treatment as a secured creditor which would entitle them to enforce the security interest upon the conclusion of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). \n\nThis raises a few issues to address in respect of its practical implications: \n\nFirst, while it is a welcome move in favour of the secured creditors, it is likely to have an impact on the interest of the RA. This is because the secured creditors are now being brought into the CIRP, albeit without a voting right, and the RA would be disincentivised from bidding for those assets which are ‘stuck’ or discount the value of those assets from the resolution plan to be put forth before the CoC. This would have the effect of carving out the assets of the corporate debtor since there is a possibility that these assets will not go along with the rest upon conclusion of the CIRP. Further, it also has the possibility to impact the clean slate theory, since there is a chance that the security holders initiate litigation post the implementation of the resolution plan to enforce the security interest which would only go to drag on the insolvency process and add to the costs of the successful RA.\n\nSecondly, there is no clarity on the amount that is to be paid to the secured creditors in this respect going by the precedent in Jaypee Kensington. While operational and dissenting financial creditors are paid the minimum liquidation value, there is no mandate for the successful RA to pay the same to the secured creditors. Expectedly, this can lead to disagreements on the amount to be paid to such creditors as well as contentions regarding the identification of a desirable asset of the creditor’s choice for enforcement as seen in IDBI Bank Limited v. Jaypee Infratech Limited. \n\nTo resolve this issue and assure the payment of at least the minimum liquidation value, it would require an amendment to include secured creditors within the ambit of Section 30(2)(b) of the  IBC.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is quite clear that both Jaypee Infratech and Phoenix ARC have taken a restrictive approach on grounds of extent of obligation and ultimate intent of such creditors which has limited the ability of third party security holders to participate in the CIRP. While Amtek Auto does widen the regulatory protection afforded to such creditors, there is a need for a legislative amendment as aforementioned to bring about a consistency in the treatment given to the security holders under a resolution plan. \n\nNevertheless, to avoid the exclusion from the CoC, third party security providers could undertake an obligation to repay the debt as well (i.e., a covenant to pay) which could be construed as a guarantee, thereby as financial debt, and allow the security holders a say in the CIRP and determine the actions to be taken with respect to their security.\nJaypee InfratechPhoenix ARCIBCCommittee of CreditorsResolution Plan\nInsolvency Law\n494 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Applications Challenging Arbitral Awards: The Issue of Non-Est Filing",
        "content": "Anupam Verma\nJul 8\n7 min read\nApplications Challenging Arbitral Awards: The Issue of Non-Est Filing\n[Anupam is a student at National Law University, Odisha.]\n\nIn India, Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (the A&C Act) confers the right upon a party to file an application before a court for setting aside an arbitral award. While filing such an application, there are certain accepted procedures that need to be followed, but they are not enumerated in the A&C Act or any other statute. There arises the question of what procedures are minor in nature and what are so material and fundamental that, in the absence of their adherence, a filing is rendered non-est. The Delhi High Court (DHC), in recent cases like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited. v. Joint Venture of M/S Sai Rama Engineering Enterprises (ONGC) and Ambrosia Corner House Private Limited v. Hangro S Foods (ACHPL), dealt with this question. In this article, the author delves deeper into the judgements, analyse the conflict that arises from them, and suggests ways to settle them by referring to the best practises of progressive jurisdictions.\n\nONGC and ACHPL Judgements\n\nIn both cases, the judgement debtors (JD) had filed applications impugning the arbitral awards within the prescribed time limit of 3 months plus the further conditional time limit of 30 days (statutory limitation) as enshrined under Section 34 of the A&C Act. But the filing had certain defects, because of which the court registry had marked it defective. The defects were as follows:\n\nONGC: (a) Some affidavits, which were signed by the deponent and also duly verified, were not attested; (b) the vakalatnama (a memorandum of appearance or any other document by which an advocate is empowered to appear or plead before any court, tribunal, or other authority) was not stamped.\n\nACHPL: (a) The copy of the impugned award was not filed along with the application; (b) The affidavit in support of the application was not attested. \n\nIn ONGC, the JD tried to cure all the defects and was successful in doing so, but not before the expiration of the statutory limitation. On the other hand, in ACHPL, the JD was also successful in weeding out all the defects and claimed to have done so within the statutory limitation, but the decree holder (DH) contested this and contended that the defects were cured after the expiry of the statutory limitation. Furthermore, the DHs in the respective cases argued that since the applications, though filed within the statutory limitation, had procedural deficiencies, they are non-est, and as the rectification was made only after the expiry of the statutory limitation, the application cannot stand. But, in both cases, the DHC decided in favour of the JD and held that the application would not be considered non-est because the defects were not material and fundamental. \n\nThe Conflict \n\nOn the face of it, the ONGC and the ACHPL judgements seem similar in nature, and indeed they are at least in their final verdict, but on the point of indispensable procedural requirements, without which a filing becomes non-est, they are in contradiction to one another. This contradiction becomes pertinent because the A&C Act does not contain any mandatory procedural requirement except for Section 34(5), which says that \"an application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party, and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement\".\n\nThe DHC, in para 41 of the ONGC, has laid down a test to determine whether a filing is non-est. The test has four indispensable components. These are that (a) the application must be intelligible, (b) the filing must be authorised, (c) it must contain contents that are material to the case, such as the names of the parties and the grounds for challenging the award, and, most importantly, (d) it must be accompanied by a copy of the impugned award. When these four requirements are adhered to, an application cannot be declared non-est, no matter what other defects it has. Furthermore, as the DHC has nowhere mentioned the conjunction or while laying down the requirements, it can safely be said that even if one of the four requirements is not adhered to, the application becomes non-est.\n\nIn recent judgements like India Tourism Development Corporation v. M/S Bajaj Electricals Limited and Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited v. Rajshekhar Construction Private Limited, the DHC has reiterated the ONGC judgement and emphasized that a Section 34 application must be accompanied by a copy of the impugned award; otherwise, the application would be non-est. \n\nOn the other hand, in the ACHPL, even though the judges refer to the ONGC judgement to support their decision, they fail to follow one of the procedural requirements laid down in the latter, i.e., the application must be accompanied by an award. Here, the JD filed a Section 34 application without a copy of the impugned award, and it was not declared non-est, but it should have been, if one is to go by ONGC. Instead, the judges relied more on the previous decision of the DHC in Oriental Insurance Company Limited v. Air India Limited (Oriental), where it was held that the filing can be held non-est only when the application is filed without the signatures of either the party or its authorised or appointed counsel.\n\nThis varying stance taken by the DHC over the course of a few judgements with regard to the importance of the copy of the impugned award is very confusing, to say the least. Moreover, both Oriental and ONGC judgements are given by division benches of the DHC, so a conundrum arises regarding which one to follow. The judges in ACHPL, in order to justify the preference of Oriental over ONGC, gave the rationale that \"the court must assess the facts of each case while determining the issue of the filing being considered non-est\" (emphasis supplied). The fact in ACHPL that led to the case being decided in favour of the JD was that the conduct of the JD, according to the judges, \"clearly evidences its endeavour to file a proper application under Section 34 within the statutory limitation.\" Going by this, in upcoming cases, it is highly possible that the threshold of procedural requirements while considering the question of an application being non-est may be different for each case. \n\nTherefore, it can be seen that the DHC has failed to provide a clear set of procedural guidelines. Although it is true that the Supreme Court (SC) has yet to deal with this question, it cannot be said with certainty that whenever it does so, it is going to steer away from ACHPL’s case-to-case reasoning. Furthermore, it does not seem feasible to wait for the SC to take up this issue. There is definitely an urgent need for a fixed set of procedural requirements without which a Section 34 application will be non-est, irrespective of the facts of each case. In the absence of such specified requirements, instances of non-est or defective filings will continue, leading to delays in the acceptance of the applications and eventually in the listing of the matters before the courts. All this will lead to delays in deciding the fate of the arbitral awards, an issue that is plaguing the Indian arbitration regime and has also been flagged by a high-level committee headed by former SC Judge Justice BN Srikrishna.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe best possible way to permanently settle the issue of vague procedural requirements is through legislative action. In this regard, one can refer to the clear enunciation of procedural requirements in the statutes of the US and the UK that are needed to be followed while challenging an arbitral award. \n\nThe US\n\nSection 10 of Title 9 of the United States Code talks about vacating or challenging an arbitral award. Section 12, inter alia, talks about notice of a motion to vacate an award, and Section 13 provides procedural requirements that need to be followed. The papers that need to be filed along with an application are: (a) the arbitration agreement, details regarding the appointment of additional arbitrators if appointed, and an extended time limit for passing the award, if any, (b) the impugned award, and (c) notices and affidavits. \n\nThe UK \n\nSections 67 and 68 of the Arbitration Act 1996 deal with challenges to arbitral awards in the UK. However, the procedural requirements that are needed to be followed while filing the arbitration claim form (N8 form) are clearly laid down under Rule 62.4 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. These are that (a) an arbitration claim form should clearly mention the remedy claimed, any questions on which the claimant seeks the decision of the court, details of the arbitral award, etc., and (b) an arbitration claim form must be served on the defendant within 1 month from the date of issue. \n\nTakeaway for India\n\nIndia also needs such legislative clarity. The best way to do this is by clearly laying down the procedural requirements in the A&C Act through an amendment. However, the requirements should not be tedious and extensive but minimal and time-efficient. This way, the JDs who decide to challenge an arbitral award will have clear procedures to follow, leading to a reduction in instances of non-est or defective filings, and court registries will have clarity regarding scenarios in which a Section 34 filing has to be marked defective.\n\nConclusion \n\nThe DHC, through its recent judgements like the ONGC and the ACHPL, has strived towards ensuring that the right of a JD to challenge an award is not denied on the basis of certain infirmities in the application. On the flip side, unfortunately, the recent judgements have also shrouded the already unspecified procedural regime in more uncertainty. However, the legislature is best suited to deal with this issue. To do so, the legislature can refer to the arbitration regimes of the US and the UK, which have a fixed set of procedural requirements laid down in their statutes. In India, the average disposal time of Section 34 applications is alarmingly high. Having clear procedural requirements can reduce instances of defective and non-est filings, leading to a reduction in delays that happen at the pre-acceptance stage of Section 34 applications.\nArbitration and ConciliationSection 34ONGCAmbrosia\nDispute Resolution\n195 views\n19 likes.

        "title": "Inclusion of Accounting Professionals under PMLA: Well-Intentioned but Misguided",
        "content": "Archit Jain\nJul 7\n7 min read\nInclusion of Accounting Professionals under PMLA: Well-Intentioned but Misguided\n[Archit is a student at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\nGiven the profession the accounting professionals like practicing Chartered Accountants (CAs), Company Secretaries (CS), Cost and Works Accountants (CWAs) etc., pursue and the duties that the same entail, they may be perceived as being facilitative of their clients' aspiration of laundering illegally-occupied money. The Central Government's move to cover these professionals within the spectrum of Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA 2002) may unreservedly be considered well-intentioned and in line with FATF's recommendations. But in doing so, the Central Government has lost sight of the challenges posed to accounting experts and their profession, such as increased responsibilities, accountability and a lingering threat of prosecution. Thus, the said move would fare well by altering the stringent, substantive aspect of the amending notification to overcome its procedural and implementation difficulties.  \n\nIntroduction\n\nMoney laundering gives oxygen to organized crime.\n\nRightly so, money laundering is a bane which not only hinders a nation's economic growth and development but also poses a threat to its security and integrity. In India, statutorily, the term 'money laundering' has been interpreted as an offence involving a person's direct or indirect attempt to indulge, knowingly assist or be actually engaged in a process or an 'activity' connected with the proceeds of crime. The Madras High Court, in Indian Bank v. Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Directorate of Enforcement (Indian Bank), observed that for a person to be guilty of the offence of money laundering, it is pertinent that he was involved in such a process or activity knowingly. \n\nIt is against the backdrop of and in response to the recent fly-by-night Chinese app scams, wherein some accounting professionals were instrumental in setting up shell companies for Chinese apps, that the Central Government has tweaked the anti-money laundering law, i.e., Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA 2002), to encompass accounting professionals like CAs, CSs, etc. within its ambit. \n\nPMLA 2002 is a central legislation aimed at deterring money laundering, providing for the confiscation of property obtained through illegal means and applies to all individuals, companies and partnership firms. This legislation has lately undergone significant changes that are aimed towards ensuring greater compliance with FATF recommendations relating to anti-money laundering (AML) / counter-terrorist financing as well as towards bringing uniformity with 2008-RBI circular requiring banks and other financial institutions to follow AML KYC norms.\n\nThis article seeks to critically analyze the latest amendments to PMLA 2002, pertaining to inclusion of accounting professionals like CAs, CSs, etc., within the ambit of anti-money laundering laws and offers suggestions to overcome the shortcomings. \n\nAmendments-in-Brief\n\nIn exercise of the powers conferred by Section 2(1)(sa)(vi) of PMLA 2002, the Finance Ministry released a couple of notifications to the effect of defining 'relevant persons'. Following this, not only accounting professionals like practicing CAs, CS, and CWAs but also all the entities assisting in the formation of a company like a director, secretary, etc. have been clutched under the gamut of PMLA, if they undertake specified activities (financial transactions) on behalf of their clients. These activities include buying and selling of any immovable property; managing of client money; organizing contributions for the creation or management of companies, etc.\n\nPursuant to these notifications, the ambit of 'reporting entities' has been expanded. A reporting entity, as defined by Section 2(1)(wa) of PMLA 2002, means and includes a banking company, a financial institution or a person carrying on a designated business or profession. On a cumulative perusal of the section mentioned above with Explanations 1 and 2 of the amending notification, it is unambiguous that the accounting professionals like practicing CAs, CSs and CWAs will also be considered reporting entities.                               \n                                                                                    The amending notification places stringent obligations on the accounting professionals as it requires them to undergo the Know Your Company (KYC) process before the commencement of each specified transaction, carry out due diligence on their client's ownership and financial status, including their clients' sources of funds along with documenting the purpose of a specific transaction. Further, as reporting entities, the accounting professionals will also be mandated to fulfil other compliances, including verifying the identity of their clients and beneficial owner and maintaining a record of all transactions undertaken on behalf of their clients.     \n                                                                             Critical Analysis\n\nThe legislative intent behind the offence of money laundering, as is evident from the terminology used in its definition, makes it abundantly clear that for the conviction to sustain, there has to be active participation on the part of the accused, and such involvement must have come through knowingly. Concerning the pertinence of the provisions of PMLA in light of a presumption, the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand, in Narendra Mohan Singh v. Directorate of Enforcement, took a strict view that direct or indirect involvement of the accused himself in any activity relating to the proceeds of crime is a sine qua non. The Madras High Court, in the Indian Bank case, remarked that, as a requisite, the accused must project the property-in-question as untainted.                                                                             It is contended that, oftentimes, despite being reasonably vigilant, accounting professionals may not even catch wind of any suspicious activity that their clients may surreptitiously be engaged in behind closed doors. In such cases, technically, even though the accounting professional might, inadvertently, have been instrumental in executing a financial transaction concerning any of the specified activities on behalf of their clients, they cannot be said to have knowingly or deliberately participated in any activity relating to the proceeds of crime.  \n                                                                                                              Further, the phrase 'projecting a property as untainted' sufficiently implies that the accounting professional must misrepresent as untainted the property, which he knows to be tainted. As a corollary to the aforesaid contention, if an accounting professional, for instance, acquires a particular property as per the instructions of his client, who has surreptitiously obtained the required funds through illegal means or has the hidden motive of using the property for unlawful purposes, the accounting professional cannot be said to have projected the property as untainted, since he did not believe it to be tainted in the first place. \n\nThe widening of PMLA's ambit and the subsequent inclusion of accounting professionals within its ambit entails that accounting professionals will now be deemed as reporting entities, which are subjected to onerous obligations and duties under the statute. One of the noteworthy obligations the accounting professionals will be required to comply with is undertaking KYC and conducting due diligence to examine the ownership and financial position, including the sources of clients' funds.                                         \n\nIt is pertinent to note that Standard of Auditing Number 320 deals with the auditor's responsibility while planning and performing an audit of financial statements and provides for the concept of materiality. Materiality can be understood as the level at which the economic decisions of the users of financial statements can be influenced by a misstatement or an omission in such statements. It is a matter of the auditor’s professional judgment that determines the materiality, which is affected by his perception of the users’ need for such financial statements. \n\nAccording to the Standards of Auditing, the auditor is entitled to set a materiality level based on his professional judgment. For instance, if he sets the standard at an amount of INR 5 lakhs, financial statements pertaining to sums greater than INR 5 lakhs will be subject to detailed/ rigorous audit, whereas those relating to sums less than the set standard, can even be processed through a mere sample audit. This loophole can potentially be used by the client who may undertake numerous transactions, say ten transactions worth INR 4 lakhs, instead of a single transaction amounting to INR 40 lakhs. Consequently, these numerous transactions would be subjected to a mere sample audit rather than a detailed scrutiny. In such a case, the accounting professional would not be at fault, technically and legally, if he/she skips the examination of sources of funds amounting to less than the materiality standard.\n\nImposing stringent obligations, like enhanced due diligence, deciphering the true purpose behind conducting any particular transaction, etc., upon the accounting professionals will negatively impact the ease of doing business for these professionals as it stupendously increases the volume of their work and responsibilities. Simultaneously, it will restrict the scope of their business owing to the increased scrutiny they will be subjected to; ultimately shifting a portion of their business to the legal professionals who, despite being equally complicit, have unjustifiably been kept out of the ambit of PMLA. \n\nMoreover, the Companies Act 2013 mandates every foreign company which seeks to set up a business in India to have a local resident director. Generally, these companies appoint their local CAs to act as ad-hoc directors. Since the CAs often perform the role of formation agents for foreign companies, bringing them under the umbrella of PMLA may negatively affect foreign investments. \n\nLastly, the forthright categorization of accounting professionals as 'relevant persons' and of the financial transactions so carried out by them on behalf of their clients as an 'activity' has the effect of shifting the onus of proving one's innocence on the accounting professional himself, contrary to the well-accepted common law doctrine of presumption of innocence. \n\nSuggestions and Conclusion\n\nThe inclusion of accounting professionals within the ambit of PMLA 2002 may be a bona fide step towards checking the imminence of money laundering, but it may be uncalled-for as these entities are already governed by various statutory bodies like the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India established by multiple acts of Parliament such as the Chartered Accountants Act 1949 wherein Chapter V deals with misconduct of the accounting professionals and Chapter VII deals with penalties. \n\nNevertheless, this inclusion must be accompanied with clearly laid down consequences and penalties specific to these professionals. This is because the involvement of the accounting professionals is only to a limited extent, is temporary and faciliatory and, therefore, subjecting them to the general punishment under the law would be unfair and disproportionate. \n\nLastly, since this change will potentially pose unprecedented challenges to accounting professionals, it must be implemented over a period of time and not abruptly in order to accord time to these professionals to establish the requisite mechanism.   \n\nIn conclusion, even though the objective behind the amending notification may be well-founded, its implementation and compliance must not be too stringent so as to blur the line between an audit and an investigation, thereby proliferating the quantum of their work and restricting the scope of their business.\nPMLAMoney LaunderingAccounting\nCorporate Law\n122 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Green Bond Roadmap: Addressing Challenges and Unlocking Sustainable Finance in India",
        "content": "Chirag Motwani, Ashlesha Pandey\nJul 3\n7 min read\nGreen Bond Roadmap: Addressing Challenges and Unlocking Sustainable Finance in India\n[Chirag and Ashlesha are students at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nThe 21st Conference of Parties has pushed for a decarbonization regime. India, with its rapid growth, has a higher burden as well, where it needs to align economic and environmental aims to create a sustainable economy. One such interesting step towards sustainable economic development is green bonds. \n\nGreen bonds are financial instruments issued to raise capital for environmentally beneficial projects, supporting sustainability, climate change mitigation, and the transition to a low-carbon economy. They fund sectors such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, waste management, and green building. Investing in green bonds enables individuals, institutions, and funds to contribute to environmental stewardship, combat climate change, and maintain financial security.\n\nHowever, the Indian market has seen a considerable dearth of growth and investment in green bonds due to multiple challenges. Despite the versatility and noble aims of green bonds, they are not lucrative or secure options in the eyes of investors. This article sets out to examine a few such challenges while offering consolidated and sustainable solutions for the same.\n\nThe Problems\n\nRanging far and wide from lack of awareness to the absence of reliable legislation, the green bond regime in India is developing at best, albeit at a considerable pace.\n\nNo specific regulatory framework \n\nThe efforts of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to streamline India's green bond framework led to revised disclosure requirements. The framework lacks standardized criteria and the involvement of uncertified third-party reviewers poses a corruption risk. The \"comply or explain\" (Regulation 1.8) regime focuses on post-dating environmental impact and lacks accountability for issuers. Non-compliance reasons are listed without specified repercussions. The annual report requirements have serious flaws as well, where the environmental damage is not quantified in measurable terms. While SEBI provides qualifiedmetrics, they are vague, allowing corporations to evade specific numbers without consequences using terms like \"qualitative performance indicators”, \"unascertained impact,\" (Regulation 2.3(b)), and \"assumption for preparations” (Regulation 2.3(c)). Further, there exist no conclusive definitional criteria for various terms, including the key word “green”, which often leads to lack of standardization. \n\nLack of standardization\n\nSovereign green bonds (SGB) serve as a benchmark for private players in developing their green bond metrics. However, a lack of standardization in defining \"green\" for green bonds creates a gap in India. The absence of clear criteria to assess environmental impacts and determine eligibility for green bond issuance makes it challenging for investors to make informed decisions and compromises the legitimacy of these bonds. Consequently, this lack of standardization discourages international investment as India's definition differs from the global standard. This often leads to higher chances of greenwashing since companies have broader leeway due to lack of set standards.\n\nGreenwashing\n\nGreenwashing is the deceptive promotion of a company's eco-friendly image, and it is prevalent in the green bond industry. Some bonds are labeled as \"green\" despite not meeting the specified criteria. With no universally recognized standard or legal definition, determining the true \"greenness\" of bonds is challenging. This uncertainty has led to growing skepticism about the credibility of green bonds. Questions arise about what qualifies a bond as green, such as compliance with the ICMA Green Bond Principles, inclusion in a green bond index, or confirmation by an independent third-party review. The lack of explicit investor protection provisions defining green bonds poses a significant risk of greenwashing and related issues.\n\nHigher costs of issuing\n\nThe high cost of issuing green bonds in India poses a challenge for the market. Green bonds are initially costly but provide long-term cost savings. In the United States, green bonds have higher costs than corporate bonds for 5-10 years, but lower costs for longer maturity periods. In contrast, in India, green bonds continue to be more expensive than corporate bonds across all periods. This increased cost is due to information asymmetries, perceived risk, and governance concerns. Unlike other nations, India lacks a comprehensive database of green projects, making it difficult to gather accurate information about available initiatives.\n\nEngagement of private players\n\nThe first two auctions of SGBs by the RBI in January 2023 were highly successful, with over four times the number of bids compared to the available bonds. Interestingly, these auctions were successful despite the slightly lower yields compared to similar government securities. This highlights the strong demand and untapped potential of India's green bond market. However, while this is a positive development for the public through SGBs, no significant steps have been taken to involve the private sector, which creates uncertainty and overlooks an important sector in the market structure. Further, private players, to promote uniform investment methods, prefer trade and investment mostly in US dollars. The Indian green bonds, issued in the Indian Rupee, fall short here.\n\nPre-dominance of rupee bonds\n\nGreen bonds in India are primarily issued in rupees and held by domestic banks, insurers, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However issuers generally prefer to issue green bonds in dollars due to the virtue of dollar being widely accepted currency globally, resulting in reduced interest from issuers. The dominance of the Indian Rupee in green bond issuance hampers foreign investment in India's market, limiting the effectiveness of green bonds and missing out on foreign investment opportunities. This structural issue underutilizes the potential of green bonds.\n\nThe Solutions\n\nStandardization via public sector \n\nIndia needs to establish clear criteria for green bonds, similar to international standards set by organizations like the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). Transparent and measurable criteria will enhance accountability and provide investors with a clear understanding of project eligibility and environmental impact. The government's promotion of green bonds can provide a reliable qualification for \"green projects.\" China and France have already seen positive outcomes from their respective green bond frameworks, which have increased the legitimacy of green bond qualifications.\n Legislative creativity\n\nComing to legislative terms, there can be concerted guidelines that can determine whether or not a project is legible for green bonds- while being in line with global standards. SEBI’s revised requirements tackle the former question to some extent with its obligations of disclosure of aims, objectives, and environmental impact assessments for projects, but to standardize such a qualification, the proposed benchmarks should focus on science-based criteria. India’s robust scientific regime and its exponential development in recent decades would further help streamline the criteria as per national needs and available, feasible, and economical technologies. Secondly, the framework for green bonds in India should align with both India's nationally determined contributions (NDC) and global standards. This might seem challenging, but it can be simplified by adopting international standards at the domestic level while maintaining a comparative approach.\n\nIn this model, the impact assessment of projects can be viewed in two ways. Firstly, a domestic standard will be established, which will have equivalent criteria for projects with domestic investments. Secondly, for projects with foreign investments, there will be a similar but not identical standard that takes into account the international perspective. By adopting this approach, India can ensure that its green bond framework is in line with its own environmental goals as well as global expectations. It allows for flexibility while maintaining a comparative basis, taking into consideration the specific context of projects with foreign investments.\n\nCertification for legitimacy and project transparency\n\nSEBI’s requirement for certification aims at roping in third-party, independent auditors for certifying the “processes including  project evaluation and selection criteria, project categories eligible for financing by green debt securities, etc.” Increasing the liability on corporations themselves, however, renders the odds towards inherently favourable reports, possible cartels, and bogus associations of such auditors. Since the framework further does not specify the absolute roles and responsibilities of such reviewers, the chances of maladministration increase as well. In such a situation, the thrust must shift towards the creation of a statutory body, akin to CBI, Center for International Climate Research  or Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd, but on a domestic level. When read with the previous suggestion, the requirements of certifiers along with criteria for legitimacy can be appended to the legislation itself. There is also a dire need for less ambiguity, which can be done by adopting the internationally accepted standard for the meanings and metrics of assessments and qualifications. Similar mandates have also been suggested by the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group.\n\nFurther, in certain cases, an increased corporate social responsibility (CSR) may be adduced to corporations, too. CSR provides for the fulfilment of social objectives. After a certain threshold companies can be directed that some number of future projects can be dealt with in green bonds. Plus, companies in environment-related products shall be advised of the use of green bonds in some manner. This can engage the private players/companies into the green bond scheme and further could help in fruitful utilization of green bonds.\n\nTax incentivisation \n\nThere is ongoing discussion regarding the implementation of explicit tax incentives for green bond issuers and investors, considering the urgency of public policy imperatives. However, significant jurisdiction-wide tax incentives for green bonds have yet to be established, with Singapore and Malaysia having made progress in this area concerning green financing. One argument against these incentives is that green-labelled bonds lack enforceable contractual rights to ensure the proceeds are used as disclosed, potentially leading to unintended subsidies for non-green bonds. This concern can be addressed by offering tax incentives specifically for bonds with clear and enforceable green-focused terms or by providing back-ended tax benefits upon bond maturity, contingent upon demonstrating compliance with the disclosed green purpose. Such measures would not only strengthen the green bond market but also enhance public policy clarity. To achieve sustainable development, India should consider providing tax incentives that incentivize green bonds while delivering positive environmental outcomes.\n Conclusion\n\nReconciling sustainability with economic development has been a global goal for almost all nations- and as far as India is concerned, the nation is headed on the correct path- even though the realization of NDCs may seem like a far-fetched goal. With green bonds, there has been a new realm of amalgamated solutions- but their whole potential remains untapped. However, the primary step would be consolidated legislation that streamlines the framework via which other solutions such as tax incentivization, global standardization and increased CSR can branch out. Nonetheless, SEBI’s efforts remain laudable in this relatively novel regime but the lack of parity with global players renders the solutions unviable in the vastly globalized economy. Active promotion and increased awareness, too, can be the initial steps toward expanding the horizons of green bonds.\nNDCGreen BondsGreenwashingSEBI\nCorporate Law\n418 views\n10 likes.

        "title": "Demystifying SEBI's Recent Consultation Paper on UPSI: Another One that Bites the Dust?",
        "content": "Jahnavi Srivastava, Samarth Agarwal\nJun 30\n5 min read\nDemystifying SEBI's Recent Consultation Paper on UPSI: Another One that Bites the Dust?\n[Jahnavi and Samarth are students at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\nThe need for inclusion of material information under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations), within the ambit of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) was felt due to inadequate disclosures by the Indian companies. It is evident from the recent findings of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in the consultation paper dated 18 May 2023 that in only around 8% instances, information was categorised as UPSI, which consequently leaves most of the information out of its ambit thereby allowing companies to escape SEBI’s surveillance for suspected insider trading. Intention behind inclusion of material information under Regulation 30 of LODR Regulations within USPI is to correct one major fallacy i.e., to curb insider trading. In this regard, the proactive approach taken by the regulator to prohibit Insider Trading cannot be neglected, which can be seen from the eight amendments the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations), witnessed in the last three years.\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that the consultation paper brings the strides made by TK Viswanathan committee report back to square one. While the committee had proposed that material information under Regulation 30 of LODR Regulations and UPSI cannot be said to be of similar nature and there certainly does exist several information which fall outside the scope of UPSI, the consultation paper seems to turn a blind eye to it.\n\nProposal of including material information under Regulation 30 within UPSI, it is argued, does provide the needed clarity and timely disclosure. However, the repeated changes that have occurred in the legal position since 2015 when it was first introduced in India to now, raises the question as to whether this consultation paper is the requisite solution or just another one that bites the dust.\n\nSEBI’s Consultation Paper: Navigating Through its Course \n\nSEBI issued a consultation paper dated 18 May 2023, proposing to review the definition of UPSI to bring clarity and uniformity. In this regard, the proposal seeks to link the definition of UPSI with ‘material events’ defined under Regulation 30 of LODR Regulations. \n\nThis amendment, if approved, will have significant impact on the corporate regime, as it will broaden the ambit of disclosures under Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations. Interestingly, UPSI, defined under Section 2(n) of Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, forms the basis for every section of Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, and thereby classification of any information under its ambit would yield in the company coming under these regulations’ radar. Furthermore, once a particular piece of information has been labelled as UPSI, certain conditions need to be met: [i] initiation of trade window closure requirement; [ii] entry to be made in structured digital database; and [iii] non-disclosure to anyone other than for a legitimate purpose.\n\nThe current position is a little dubious. The Securities Appellate Tribunal, in some cases, has observed material information to be excluded from UPSI. On the other hand, in other set of judgements, it has observed that as long as a company believes some data to be material information, it has to be disclosed and subsequently, mere knowledge of the same will make it UPSI.\n\nExpanding the ambit of UPSI to entail material events under Regulation 30 warrants a closer look at what all will it actually entail. In this regard, Regulation 30 has to be read with List 3 of LODR Regulations, which contains Schedule 3. Pursuant to Regulation 30, events or information encapsulated in Para A and B of Part A of Schedule III are required to be disclosed to the exchange. While Para A of Part A includes information, being relevant to the shareholders, which are deemed to be material and is subject to disclosure, Para B requires disclosure to be made only if it meets materiality policy of the entity. Pertaining the latter, SEBI released a consultation paper proposing a quantitative criterion for disclosures, i.e., threshold value of the events must exceed 2% turnover, or 2% of net worth, or 5% of 3 year average profit or loss. This provides great relief from the vast discretion that rests with SEBI.  \n\nA Step in the Right Direction?\n\nThe aftermath of inclusion of material events/information within UPSI will be an intriguing development. While it will usher a new era in the Indian insider trading regime, given the repeated changes in the position, its success needs to be weighed. \n\nThe proposed amendment, introduced with a view to counter insider trading, surely tends to implement a tighter regime, thereby obliterating any chances of any material event or information escaping from the clutches of UPSI, and subsequently insider trading regulations. This will ensure that the companies are left with no opportunity to take any advantage of the loophole in the system. \n\nHowever, the measure is not immune to certain probable obstructions. Inclusion of all information, specifically under Para A of Part A of Schedule III, raises the moot question as to whether all such information is of the nature of UPSI. The authors submit that the answer should be in negative. \n\nSeveral information such as appointment/discontinuation of share transfer agent or proceedings of annual general meeting may be of informational relevance but cannot be said to cause price variation in scrip prices. This is where the difference between UPSI and material event/information under Regulation 30 creeps in, where the former has the potential to cause significant price movement and the latter does not. Consequently, the said move tends to overregulate, and include material information within UPSI’s purview, even when it is not. Furthermore, once an information is termed as UPSI, all the compliances under Prohibition of Insider Trading regulations have to be mandatorily followed, thereby resulting in additional burden on companies and being time consuming. \n\nIt is submitted that while SEBI is right in saying that there exists a problem, the solution that SEBI is adopting needs some tweaking. From compliance perspective, SEBI should introduce a clarification as to what specific compliances are to be made, in order to imbibe certainty and foreseeability in the text of the regulation. \n\nIt is suggested that the primary reform that must be brought about is to include a specific threshold in materiality. Presently, on account of threshold criterion being absent, SEBI warrants disclosures to be made no matter how insignificant the event/information is. Threshold must be present so as to adjudicate if the information is going to have any impact on the company or its ability to conduct business. In this regard, the consultation paper introduced by SEBI in November 2022, comes in handy. While it only focuses at providing a numeric threshold for events/information under Para B of Part A of Schedule 3, it is suggested that the scope must be broadened to cover Para A and other material information as well.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe proposed amendment, in recent times, is certainly a positive step to enhance regulatory effectiveness and create a level playing field for market participants. It will help to resolve the issue of non-disclosure by companies by providing clarity and fill the loophole that currently exists. However, inclusion of all material information within the ambit of UPSI might prove to be a little extreme, considering the findings of TK Viswanathan Committee which identified “all material events may not necessarily be UPSI.” Considering the frequency of changes being made by SEBI, it is important that SEBI undertakes longer deliberations so as to reach a sound conclusion. It is interesting to note how SEBI is shifting its approach from looking only at price sensitivity to now looking at materiality of information too. Only time shall tell as to whether this consultation paper will be welcomed by the industry, and whether it will be able to bring clarity with respect to UPSI in true sense or not.\nSEBIConsultation PaperUPSIInsider Trading\nCorporate Law\n316 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Enforceability of Keepwell Agreements in India: A First Principles Analysis",
        "content": "Avanish Kar, Eshan Chaubal\nJun 26\n6 min read\nEnforceability of Keepwell Agreements in India: A First Principles Analysis\n[Avanish and Eshan are students at NALSAR University of Law and Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur, respectively.]\n\nA keepwell agreement/ undertaking is an arrangement wherein a parent company promises to a third-party lender that it will provide the subsidiary with all necessary financial wherewithal to put it in a position to honor the obligations under the primary facility / loan agreement. The purpose of keepwell agreements is to improve the creditworthiness of the subsidiary and reduce the risk involved in the facility agreement. Keepwell agreements have in sometimes been treated as guarantees, whereas an analysis of their language would reveal that they are the closest to, if not synonymous with, letters of comfort. \n\nThe enforceability of keepwell agreements has been subject to extensive debate in courts in China and Hong Kong, where these agreements are popular. As recently as May 2023, the High Court of Hong Kong held a keepwell deed to be enforceable and awarded USD 164 million in damages to the defendant who breached its obligations under the keepwell deed. \n\nKeepwell agreements are gaining currency, especially in transactions involving foreign lenders. With the new impetus given to external commercial borrowings by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by relaxing norms, foreign lenders are using a variety of instruments to secure their lending transactions. Whether these instruments provide a legal and enforceable security or a mere sense of “comfort”, needs to be tested on the touchstone of the first principles of the Indian Contract Act 1872 (ICA).  \n\nIs There a Valid Consideration for Parent Company?\n\nOne crucial aspect in determining the enforceability of an agreement is consideration. In a standard keepwell agreement, no specific money consideration moves from the lender to the parent company. However, consideration can be in terms of performances or promises to perform in the future, which must be valuable. \n\nIs there anything valuable being moved from the lender to the parent company? In a keepwell agreement, a promise (express or implied) is indeed moved from the lender to the parent company, in the form of a covenant to honour the facility agreement. The next question is, whether this promise is sufficient consideration, given that it is of value to the subsidiary, a separate legal entity? It is settled law that this consideration would be sufficient based on Section 2(d) of the ICA, as explained below with the help of a reference to the authoritative text of Pollock and Mulla. \n\nAs per Pollock and Mulla, “consideration can be of benefit to the promisor or a third party or even no apparent benefit but merely to the detriment to the promisee. Detriment to the promisee suffices even if there is no benefit to the promisor (O’Sullivan v. Management Agency & Music Ltd (1985) 3 All ER 351; Re Dale (1994) Ch 31; Jones v. Padavatton (1969) 1 WLR 628 (giving up a job), Tanner v. Tanner (1975) 3 All ER 776; Coombes v. Smith (1986) WLR 808)”.\n\nThe detriment to the promisee in a keepwell agreement is the risk of giving a loan under the facility agreement. The benefit to the third party in a keepwell agreement is the benefit to the subsidiary company taking the loan on the basis of the keepwell agreement. Mulla also states, “consideration may move from promisee to any person and not necessarily only to the promisor. Contract can still arise even if the promise to do or abstain from doing was for the benefit of a third party.” Therefore, a keepwell agreement is not necessarily unenforceable for the want of consideration. \n\nAre Keepwell Agreements Synonymous with Performance Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort?\n\nIn Cruz City 1 Mauritius Holdings v. Unitech Limited, the Delhi High Court refused to set aside a foreign award in regarding a contractual dispute arising from a keepwell agreement. The said award treated the keepwell agreement as a guarantee. While the peculiar nature of the keepwell agreement in that case might have made it a guarantee, it is not the case that every keepwell agreement is a guarantee. \n\nAs per Section 126 of the ICA, a contract of guarantee is a “contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person, in case of his default.” Superficially, keepwell agreements can be seen as guarantees, but there is a nuanced difference between the two. While it is true that a guarantee can be for the performance of a duty (in the form of a “performance guarantee”), the surety in a guarantee is expected to substitute the performance of the principal debtor. In a keepwell agreement, the parent company does not promise the lender to substitute the performance expected from the subsidiary in the facility agreement. Instead, the parent promises to put the subsidiary in a position to perform its obligations under the facility agreement. Thus, there is no “mirroring” of duties involved in a keepwell agreement, as opposed to a tripartite contract of guarantee. A keepwell agreement therefore creates a duty for the parent company which is different from the specific duties given to a surety under a contract of guarantee. \n\nSection 124 of the ICA defines a contract of indemnity as, “a contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person”. The distinction between a contract of indemnity and a keepwell agreement is thus the requirement of proving actual loss to seek enforcement. It was held by the Supreme Court of India in State Bank of Saurashtra v. M/s Ashit Shipping Services (Private) Limited and Another that in order to sustain a claim based on an indemnity, it has to be established that loss has been sustained. The Supreme Court also remarked that a mere breach may not automatically result in a loss. A keepwell agreement ordinarily stipulates that upon a default by the subsidiary, the lender can require the parent to do all the steps necessary to put the subsidiary in a position to fulfil its obligations. Thus, in contradistinction to an indemnity, a keepwell agreement may be sought to be automatically enforced in case of a default, even if the lender sustains no actual loss.\n\nA letter of comfort, in substance, is the same as a keepwell agreement. The parent’s duties to the lender in a letter of comfort remain the same as those in a keepwell agreement. In United Breweries (Holdings) Limited v. Karnataka Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Limited, the Karnataka High Court defined a letter of comfort as “a document that indicates one party's intention to try to ensure that another party complies with the terms of a financial transaction without guaranteeing performance in the event of default.”\n\nThe only difference lies in form. Keepwell agreements, instead of letters, have been drafted as deeds or agreements. It is a recognized principle of contractual construction that the title or form of a document is not determinative of its substance. \n\nApplying the Views of High Courts on Enforceability of Letters of Comfort in the Context of Keepwell Agreements\n\nThus, the decisions of the High Courts in India which clarified the enforceability of letters of comfort become relevant. The Delhi High Court in Lucent Technologies Inc. v. ICICI Bank Limited and Others, held that with regard to the letter of comfort in question, the circumstances and documents did not indicate the intention to create legal relations. Further, in Yes Bank Limited v. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited [LD-VC-IA Number 1 of 2020 in LD-VC-Suit Number 120 of 2020], the Bombay High Court differentiated guarantees from letters of comfort. It said that a letter of comfort can be a guarantee only if the conditions under Section 126 of the ICA are met. However, the Bombay High Court ordered the payment of damages for a breach of the letter of comfort. \n\nTaking cues from these decisions, it is clear that the enforceability of a keepwell agreement, too, would depend upon its language, which should be clear on (1) the sufficiency of consideration, and (2) the intention of the parties to enter into a legally binding relationship. A mention of the facility agreement and the context of the execution of the keepwell agreement in the recitals of it would be a good way to express intention, in addition to a specific covenant to that effect. \n\nConclusion\n\nLike letters of comfort, the enforceability of keepwell agreements would depend on how the parties express their intention to enter into legal relations. However, the RBI views letters of comfort as unenforceable documents. The RBI in its guidance note to credit rating agencies (CRAs) makes note of letters of comfort as “diluted” or “non-prudent” structures. Therefore, letters of comfort are not to be considered by CRAs while assessing the creditworthiness of a company. Whether this tendency to view letters of comfort as ipso facto unenforceable would be seen in the context of keepwell agreements (given the difference in their form) is something that time will tell.\nKeepwell AgreementLetter of ComfortGuaranteeIndemnityIndian Contract Act\nCommercial Law\n330 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "SEBI (PUSTA) Regulations: An Indeterminate Shifting of Evidentiary Burden?",
        "content": "Harshit Singh, Jay Shah\nJun 25\n6 min read\nSEBI (PUSTA) Regulations: An Indeterminate Shifting of Evidentiary Burden?\n[Harshit and Jay are students at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nOn 18 May 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released a consultation paper seeking public comments on the draft SEBI (Prohibition of Unexplained Suspicious Trading Activities in the Securities Market) Regulations 2023 (SEBI PUSTA Regulations). The consultation paper comes against the backdrop of increasing instances of contravention of the securities laws resulting in manipulative and fraudulent trade practices, insider trading, front-running etc. With the advent of new technology and novel methods, SEBI has recognised its difficulty in establishing sufficient evidence while prosecuting cases. Evasive tactics like using mule accounts, layering funds through a complex web of transactions, and using end-to-end encrypted mediums like WhatsApp, FaceTime etc., have rendered traditional sources of evidence collection like bank records and call data ineffective.\n\nThe SEBI PUSTA Regulations aim to deal with unexplained suspicious trading patterns around the presence of material non-public information (MNPI). The primary objective of the regulations is to bring charges against market participants based on a certain amount of rebuttable presumption, which may, however, be refuted by a satisfactory explanation. It is a significant departure from the established jurisprudence regarding evidentiary standards in insider trading and unfair trade practices. Through this article, the authors analyse the regulations and provide their comments critically. \n\nKey Provisions of SEBI PUSTA Regulations\n\nUnusual trading pattern \n\nRegulation 2(1)(j) defines an unusual trading pattern (UTP) as a repetitive pattern of trades which involves: (i) a substantial change in risk over a short time period, and (ii) has resulted in abnormal profits or averted abnormal losses during the same period. \n\nMNPI\n\nRegulation 2(1)(f) defines MNPI as: (i) any information about a security which is not available generally and shall have a reasonable impact on its prices upon becoming available; or (ii) information about an impending order in a security on a stock exchange, which, when executed, will have an impact on its prices; or (iii) information about an impending recommendation of a security by an influencer to the public/followers/subscribers, which shall impact its prices upon becoming generally available. \n\nSuspicious trading activity \n\nRegulation 2(1)(i) defines suspicious trading activity (STA). STA will be deemed when an individual or a group of connected persons exhibit UTP, and such UTP coincides with the presence of MNPI. \nFor ease of explanation, STA = UTP + presence of MNPI. \n\nOnce an STA is established, a presumption of violation shall be raised, and SEBI will initiate proceedings against the persons/group of connected persons. The onus of proof will shift to such persons, and they will be liable for action unless they can rebut the presumption through sufficient explanation. \n\nRebuttal \n\nThe presumption of an STA can be rebutted by demonstrating any of the circumstances mentioned in Regulation 5(2) of the draft SEBI PUSTA Regulation. A rebuttal can be made by providing detailed documentary evidence proving that either the information was not MNPI, the trading activity did not exhibit any UTP or the trades were not based on MNPI. \n\nUnexplained suspicious trading activity \n\nAs per Regulation 2(1)(k), when no explanation or reasonable rebuttal is provided to the presumption of STA, such trading activity will be deemed to be unexplained suspicious trading activity (USTA). Any person or group of persons engaged in USTA will be liable for action by SEBI under the Regulation. \n\nIn other words, it can be explained as USTA = STA + (absence of reasonable rebuttal/explanation).  \n\nA separate penalty provision is not provided in the regulations; therefore, reliance could be placed on Section 15HB of the SEBI Act 1992, which provides for a penalty extendable up to ₹1 crore, in cases of violation. \n\nAnalysis \n\nThe SEBI PUSTA Regulations will bring in a tremendous change in the manner SEBI conducts its investigation and prosecution. Once an STA is established, the onus of proof or the evidentiary burden will shift to the person who is accused of exhibiting such activity. The regulations will arm SEBI with raising a presumption of guilt even without establishing any causal link between the suspicious trades and the wrong it intends to curb. Mere suspicion of irregular trading patterns with no cause-and-effect relationship is not enough to raise a presumption. The suspicion must be accompanied by some circumstantial evidence, and a reasonable nexus must be drawn between UTP and MNPI.\n\nFurther, jurisprudence could be imported from the landmark judgement given by the Supreme Court (SC) in the case of Balram Garg v. SEBI, wherein it was held that trading pattern merely in the presence of any non-public material information cannot be enough circumstantial evidence. Cogent material must be produced to establish the communication or possession of such information. Further, the SC in the case of Seema Silk & Sarees v. Directorate of Enforcement, held that “reverse burden as a statutory presumption is permitted, but it can be raised only when certain foundational facts are established by the prosecution.” The SEBI PUTSA Regulations seek to prosecute the accused by raising a presumption merely on suspicion without establishing any foundational facts or producing any cogent evidence on record to back it up.\n\nSpecific challenges with the regulations have been explained below. \n\nStandards for reverse onus of proof are not clearly defined  \n\nOnce SEBI establishes an STA, it will raise a rebuttable presumption of guilt on such a person or group of persons undertaking the trading activity. The burden to provide a reasonable explanation to rebut the presumption will lie upon the accused. This shifting of burden is called reverse onus. However, in cases where there is a reverse onus, it becomes increasingly important to have clearly defined standards which would trigger the shifting of the evidentiary burden on the accused. It is an established principle in law that when the burden of proof shifts, the standards must be clearer and objective to function as safeguards. \n\nHowever, the SEBI PUSTA Regulations fail to establish clear standards for STA. The definition provided for UTP is ambiguous. The term ‘substantial change in risk’ in Regulation 2(1)(j) is vague and could virtually cover all trading activities in its ambit. Further, the term ‘abnormal profits or abnormal losses’ is subjective and not clearly defined. Abnormal returns in the securities market are a common phenomenon and do not necessarily accompany any unfair trade practice. Providing a rebuttal for the same would be burdensome on the accused. An exemption must also be provided for algo trading. With the current definition of UTP, all algo trades could be classified as UTP since the primary objective of such trades is to generate abnormal returns through repetitive trades in a short time period with the help of algorithms and AI.\n\nProviding a ‘detailed documentary evidence’ to rebut the presumption may be impossible\n The standard of evidence that is required to rebut the presumption of STA is very onerous on the accused. Proviso to Regulation 5(2) states that the person shall present a ‘detailed documentary evidence’ to substantiate any claim. In the securities market, providing a trail of documents proving that the trading pattern was not UTP or that the person did not act on MNPI can be impossible. It will be challenging for the accused to rebut a presumption by proving a negative or proving the inexistence of certain scenarios. \n\nIncorrect reliance is placed on domestic and international legal provisions \n\nIn the consultation paper, SEBI has relied on international and domestic laws to prove that the law allows raising a certain level of rebuttable presumption to bring charges. It has quoted Section 11 of the Securities Act 1933 of the United States of America. It raises a rebuttable presumption on underwriters and directors in cases of misstatements or material omission in the registration of a public securities offering. The presumption can be rebutted by using the defence of due diligence. \nFurther, SEBI has also relied on Section 68 of the Income-tax Act 1961 (IT Act) which provides a presumption about the assessee's income if no explanation is offered about the source of cash credits found in its books. \n\nHowever, such reliance on domestic and international provisions is incorrect as the nature of the activity regulated by these legal provisions is entirely unrelated. The provision for rebuttable presumption under the IT Act is provided in the parent legislation itself; however, no such provision exists in the SEBI Act. The draft regulations may be challenged on the grounds of unconstitutionality. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn its current form, the SEBI PUTSA Regulations have the potential to be misused by the regulator and can have chilling effects on legitimate trading activity in the capital market. It is the authors’ opinion that the standards that will trigger the reverse onus of proof should be unambiguous, objective and clearly defined to act as safeguards. The definitions of UTP and MNPI should be crystallised further and must provide quantitative standards. SEBI should further clarify and explain why it considers specific parameters in the definition of STA as an outlier event, so much so that it is sufficient to trigger a reverse onus of proof and shift the evidentiary burden on the accused. The standard of evidence required to rebut the presumption by the accused must also be lowered so as not to restrain any legitimate trading. Further, the regulations must also provide for establishing a causal nexus between STA and MNPI based on some foundational facts, and mere suspicion should not be enough to raise a presumption of guilt.\nSEBIUnusual Trading PatternsSuspicious Trading ActivityBurden of Proof\nCorporate Law\n513 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Legatum Ventures Limited v. ACIT: Ramifications in the Legal Sphere",
        "content": "Swetha Somu\nJun 24\n6 min read\nLegatum Ventures Limited v. ACIT: Ramifications in the Legal Sphere\n[Swetha is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe recent case of Legatum Ventures Limited v. ACIT (Legatum Ventures) has served to muddy the waters than towards the development of our Income Tax regime. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (ITAT) has ruled that the capital gain for a foreign company on selling shares of an unlisted Indian company is to be computed without giving effect to foreign exchange fluctuations. \n\nThe interpretation of the law regarding long-term capital gains Legatum Ventures has significant implications in the attribution of profit in India. This is because it affects the computation of capital gains for non-residents by establishing that the taxing provision under Section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the Income-tax Act 1961 (Act) will prevail over the general computation under Section 48 in matters dealing with unlisted shares.\n\nThe article analyses the recent order interpreting Sections 112(1)(c)(iii) and 48 of the Act by assessing whether the use of the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant to this case was correct or whether it goes beyond the powers of ITAT. The author concludes by stating that this tribunal’s interpretation will have certain legal implications, thus, an appeal should be pursued.\n\nBrief Factual Matrix\n\nThe company being evaluated was established in the United Arab Emirates and was primarily engaged in investment activities. During the examination, the Assessing Officer (AO) noticed that the company had sold shares of an unlisted Indian private limited company and calculated the capital gains using the first proviso to Section 48 of the Act, along with Rule 115A of the Income Tax Rules 1962. This calculation resulted in a loss of INR 3,63,87,392. Consequently, the assessee filed a tax return with nil income.\n\nLater, the tax return filed by the assessee was chosen for an audit, and the AO argued that capital gains on the sale of unlisted shares should only be computed according to Section 112(1)(c)(iii) of Act. According to this section, the first proviso should be disregarded. As a result, the AO assessed the Assessee's total income at INR 17,13,59,838 which was to be taxed at 10%.\n\nSection 48 merely specifies the method of calculating income in the form of capital gains and the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on non-residents' income is basically mitigated by the first proviso of the section. Meanwhile Section 112 establishes the tax rate (10%) applicable to long-term capital gains. \n\nThe AO determined that the provision of Section 112(1)(c)(iii) is applicable only to non-residents. Consequently, the AO calculated the capital gains using Section 112(1)(c)(iii), resulting in its finding of long-term capital gains exceeding INR 17 crores.\n\nAggrieved by the order, the assessee objected before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP). The DRP upheld the AO's additions. In response to DRP’s order, the assessee appealed to ITAT.\n\nArguments Made by the Assessee\n\nThe assessee contended that Section 112 applies only when the total income includes income generated from the sale of a long-term capital asset that falls under the ‘capital gains’. This is because it specifies how the tax payable by the assessee on the total income should be calculated in such instances. On the other hand, Section 48 of the Act outlines the method for computing income under the ‘capital gains’ category. \n\nIt was asserted that Section 112 of the Act is applicable only when the taxpayer's total income includes capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset. In such cases, Section 112 determines how the tax on the total income should be calculated. However, since the present situation involves a long-term capital loss after adjusting for inflation, Section 112 does not apply. Instead, the taxpayer has the right to carry forward this loss to future years as per the provisions of Section 74 of the Act. Therefore, the assessee stated that there is no requirement to pay tax under Section 112 in the current scenario.\n\nThus, the assessee argued that since the computation as per Section 48 resulted in a long-term capital loss, the provisions of Section 112(1)(c)(iii) are not applicable.\n\nArguments made by the Departmental Representative (DR)\n\nOn the other hand, the DR strongly argued that the term ‘income’ has a broad meaning and includes negative income as well. The DR relied heavily on the decisions made by the lower authorities. It was contended that Section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the Act is applicable to the current situation because the taxpayer is a non-resident who sold shares of an Indian unlisted company. Furthermore, the DR stated that even if the tax liability is calculated in accordance with Section 112(1)(c)(iii), it would result in long-term capital gains in this particular case.\n\nIssue Framed\n\nWhether the computation prescribed under Section 112(1)(c)(iii) or Section 48 is applicable in matters where a non-resident sells shares of an unlisted company.\n\nITAT’s Observations and Order\n\nFirstly, the ITAT observed that Section 112 deals with the calculation of tax payable by the taxpayer on their total income, including income derived from the transfer of a long-term capital asset subject to ‘capital gains’. However, for non-residents (excluding companies) or foreign companies, sub-clause (iii) of clause (c) in subsection (1) provides a specific method for computing capital gains. According to Section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the Act, in the case of a non-resident, capital gains from the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a company with limited public interest should be calculated without considering the first and second provisos of Section 48 of the Act. Therefore, the court deemed it a specific provision that applies to non-residents and the transfer of unlisted shares. On the other hand, Section 48 was deemed to be a general provision that applies to the computation of capital gains in all cases of asset transfer. \n\nMoreover, with the understanding of the two sections in question, the court made its interpretation of the statutory provisions using the well-established principle of generallia specialibus non derogant (general provisions does not derogate from specific ones) and held that it in scenarios as such, it is Section 112(1)(c)(iii) that should be used instead of Section 48 of the Act.\n\nAfter that, the court also considered yet rejected the possibility of using harmonious interpretation, by reconciling both Section 112(1)(c)(iii) and Section 48 of the Act, for the reason that if the assessee followed the method prescribed under Section 48, it would render the computation method provided in Section 112(1)(c)(iii) completely unnecessary and redundant.\n\nHence, the ITAT ruled that since the Assessee was a non-resident, the provision under Section 112 (1)(c)(iii) is attracted while simultaneously negating the first and second provision of Section 48 of the Act.\n\nNotable Observations\n\nSection 112(1)(c)(iii) of the Act was incorporated to provide clarity and specific guidelines for calculating and taxing capital gains for non-residents and foreign companies in relation to the transfer of unlisted shares/securities. It prescribes the computation of capital gains in these unique circumstances. Meanwhile, Section 48 was introduced to provide a general provision that governs the computation of capital gains in a systematic and equitable manner, ensuring uniformity in the tax treatment of different types of asset transfers.\n\nThis judgement has completely disregarded the inclusion of foreign exchange fluctuations as a factor in calculating capital gains derived from the transfer of unlisted securities or shares. It is also to be noted that the current stance is attracted only to transfers of shares of an unlisted company and not a listed one. \n\nFurther, it is a matter of thought that since both the provisions in question exist for different objectives, can both objectives coexist without rendering other provisions unnecessary? If so, does ITAT have the power to read down a particular provision in relation to another?\n\nMoreover, the established stance causes a substantial disadvantage for non-residents. With the consistent depreciation of INR against USD, non-residents may incur substantial long-term capital losses as per Section 48. However, Section 112(1)(c)(iii) continues to enforce a 10% tax on the INR-denominated value of these long-term capital gains. This situation appears unjust for non-residents, as they are subjected to taxation based on foreign exchange movements between the purchase and sale prices.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn sum, the order is a significant blow as the current computation becomes a disincentive to the non-resident investors from participating in the practice of buying and selling unlisted shares, also known as over-the-counter securities. Section 48 of the Act is very intrinsic. It is a core provision in the Act which cannot be negated entirely by putting the special provision of Section 112(1)(c)(iii) on a higher pedestal merely because the latter is a specific provision. Hence, it is recommended that the higher courts examine these facets of law for a more comprehensive understanding and interpretation of this legal issue at hand.\nIncome-Tax ActCapital GainsLegatum Ventures\nTaxation Law\n96 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Flip Structure in the New Overseas Investment Regime: A Wise Move Or Bigger Threat",
        "content": "Ojasav Chitranshi, Deesha Reshmi\nJun 24\n6 min read\nFlip Structure in the New Overseas Investment Regime: A Wise Move Or Bigger Threat\n[Ojasav and Deesha are students at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nThe recent growth of India's startup ecosystem can be attributed to a combination of favorable government policies and incentives. This convergence has led to an increase in the number of entrepreneurs who seek to externalize or “flip” their company structure, relocating their holding company to countries such as Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, etc., as their businesses expand globally. This process of externalization is driven by various factors, including easier access to international financing, regulated markets, a structure familiar to private equity investors, and the opportunity to list on foreign stock exchanges.\n\nPreviously, there were no strict regulations regarding flip structures in India. However, the country's economic climate has improved due to a new investment system, which has been made possible by the relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment. The previous system has undergone several modifications and enhancements, with the most significant one allowing investments in foreign companies that have a presence in India. Given the current state of the investment regime in the country, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of this legislative change of permitting startups to undertake flip structure under the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Directions 2022 (OI Directions).\n\nFor this, the authors examine the concept of flip structures and explore the reasons behind their increasing popularity. They then focus on the position of flip structures within the new overseas investment regime. The authors also analyze the legislative steps taken and provide their opinion on the matter. Finally, the article will conclude with a suitable summary.\n\nFlip Structure: An Overview\n\nA “flip” structure, also known as a round-tripping structure, involves a corporate inversion where a company establishes a holding company in a foreign jurisdiction that offers favorable business conditions. The company's shares are then transferred to the holding company, effectively making the company a wholly-owned subsidiary of the foreign entity.\n\nThe primary factors driving the adoption of flip structures are financial accessibility and a conducive business environment. Given the limited investment opportunities in India, companies have realized the importance of attracting global interest to expand their pool of funding. The holding company serves as an investment vehicle, allowing partners and investors to focus on attracting investment specifically to the holding company.\n\nFurthermore, a share exchange is typically carried out during a flip process. Shareholders of the local company exchange their shares for shares of the foreign holding company once the Indian business owners establish it. As a result, the shareholders of the domestic company also become shareholders of the foreign holding company. To simplify the complexities of a stock swap, a flip structure may be utilized, wherein the shareholders of the Indian business purchase shares in the overseas holding company, and the overseas holding company acquires all shares of the Indian company from the shareholders.\n\nConsequently, the benefits of easier access to funding, stable regulations, familiarity with the structure for private equity investors, and a favorable platform for public listing in foreign jurisdictions provide compelling reasons for Indian companies to relocate to foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe New Regime\n\nBy virtue of Regulation 3 of the OI Directions, an Indian resident may make or transfer any investment or financial commitment outside India under general permission/automatic route, subject to the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Rules 2022 (OI Rules) and Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Regulations 2022 (OI Regulations). Consequently, foreign investment in a foreign entity engaged in a bona genuine commercial activity may be made directly or through an SDS/special-purpose vehicle. This must be read in conjunction with Rule 9 of the OI Rules, which states that “any investment made outside of India by an Indian resident must be made in a foreign entity engaged in a bona fide business activity, either directly or through a step-down subsidiary or a special-purpose vehicle, subject to the limits and conditions set forth in the specified legislation.”\n\nThe rules contain a provision emphasising that the structure of a foreign entity's subsidiary or step-down subsidiary must meet the structural criteria of a foreign entity. In addition, the explanation offered in the rule defining bona fide business activity fills the void left by the absence of a definition in the previous regime. The term “bona fide business activity” refers to any commercial activity permitted by the laws of India and the host country or host jurisdiction.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has retained control despite liberalising the regime by stating that, if necessary, it may stipulate the ceiling for the aggregate outflows during a financial year on account of financial commitment or overseas portfolio investment and also stipulate the ceiling above which the amount of financial commitment by an Indian resident in a financial year shall require its prior approval. Thus, the legislators have achieved a balance in the new investment environment.\n\nPermitting the Flip Structure: An Analysis\n\nThe bright side \n\nUnder the previous ODI regime, there was regulatory ambiguity and uncertainty. For instance, in order for an Indian party to invest in a foreign entity, the foreign entity had to be involved in a “bona fide business activity.” However, there was no clear definition of what constituted a legitimate economic operation, leading to confusion and uncertainty when seeking approval from the RBI.[1] On the contrary, the OI Directions define “bona fide business activity\" as any economic activity permitted by the laws of both India and the host country. This definition is broad enough to encompass all legal enterprises in both India and the foreign country in question.\n\nUnder the current regime, Indian entities are expressly authorized to invest in foreign entities with Indian subsidiaries, subject to certain restrictions, including a maximum of two levels of subsidiaries in the corporate structure. Compared to the previous regime, the new rules have made India's ODI policy more liberal, predictable, and understandable. Some compliance requirements have been reduced, and more general permissions are granted automatically. Challenges remain regarding the definition of control, regulation of ODIs in international startups, and the concept of subsidiary layers. Nevertheless, the overall shift brought about by the current regime is a positive development in light of following benefits:\n\nIncreased capital for investment\n\nAllowing foreign investors to invest in Indian startups can significantly increase the availability of capital. This infusion of funds can help startups scale their operations, develop innovative products or services, and expand their reach in the market.\n\nAccess to global markets\n\nForeign investment can provide startups with access to international markets, networks, and distribution channels. This exposure to global markets can help startups expand their customer base, increase exports, and foster international collaborations, ultimately contributing to their growth and success.\n\nTechnological advancements\n\nFDI can facilitate the transfer of advanced technologies, research and development capabilities, and innovation-driven practices to Indian startups. This exposure to cutting-edge technologies can foster technological advancements and enable startups to create more innovative and globally competitive products or services.\n\nKnowledge transfer\n\nForeign investors often bring valuable industry expertise, technical know-how, and best practices that can benefit Indian startups. This knowledge transfer can enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of local entrepreneurs, leading to the overall growth and development of the startup ecosystem.\n\nThe dark side \n\nAs much as the above considerations are relevant, the following also assume significance.\n\nFirst, when an Indian company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign corporation, the Indian government loses its ability to tax future capital gains, profits from public listings, and operational profits, resulting in economic and national losses.\n\nSecond, flipping poses a security risk as vital information and potential value derived from associated intellectual property are compromised.\n\nThird, the Indian government may have security concerns regarding the source of funding for these companies if they are headquartered outside of India, particularly in the event of future hostile actions.\n\nFourth, flipping benefits international investors who seek to capitalize on India's thriving economy without physically entering the country, potentially leading to a cycle of asset resale that bypasses India's interests.\n\nFifth, as these privatized businesses list overseas, there will be reduced liquidity in Indian public equities markets, and foreign investors can profit from India's resources and growing economy without adhering to local regulations.\n\nHowever, despite these drawbacks, the discussed advantages and the need for a liberalized approach outweigh the cons. The significant loss of foreign investment and other obstacles were more detrimental. Therefore, the new regime is a positive development, but caution should be exercised in its implementation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndian startups are considering externalization as a viable method to expand their businesses. However, before opting for externalization, they carefully evaluate the regulatory and compliance consequences, including foreign investment rules, tax regulations, fair pricing mechanisms, and intellectual property considerations. Successful flip structures take all these aspects into account and align their structures accordingly. In the wake of the COVID-19 impact on the Indian economy, legislators aimed to strike a balance between conflicting requirements by establishing an investor-friendly system and revitalizing the economy through investment rules and regulations.\n\nThe new ODI regime, by permitting flip structures, has opened up significant potential for Indian startups to attract international portfolio investors and foreign investments. Improved access to funds will prevent innovative ideas from being hindered by capital constraints.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Economic Survey 2023, Indian startups are choosing to relocate or redomicile within India. This involves reverse flipping, where the corporate headquarters are moved from outside of India to locations within the country. Recent examples include the relocation of the headquarters of Indian fintech unicorn PhonePe from Singapore to Bengaluru. These developments indicate positive progress, reflecting the efforts of lawmakers in creating an investor-friendly environment and stimulating the economy through investment rules and regulations. However, it is crucial to address the significant risks posed by the permissible flip structures and expedite legislative measures to establish a more comprehensive overseas investment regime.\n[1] Ritesh Dwivedi, Indian Startups: Analyzing Their Vulnerabilities and Prevailing Challenges, 6, SMS J. of Entrepreneurship & Innovation, pp 61-79, (2019).\nOverseas InvestmentFlip StructuresRBI\nCorporate Law\n277 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "content": "Mayank Gandhi\nJun 22\n7 min read\nSettling Troubled Waters for Indian Whistleblowers: Study From Cross-Jurisdictional Perspective\n[Mayank is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur.]\n\nThe concept of corporate governance refers to practices adopted by corporations to regulate their internal affairs. Sound corporate governance practices increase the goodwill of the company, boost investor confidence and improve relationship of the company’s management with its stakeholders. In building a sound corporate governance structure, a robust and strong whistleblower policy plays a very vital role. The term 'whistleblower' generally refers to a person who discloses or reports public interest information about wrongdoings in an organisation. In promoting the role of a whistleblower, legislature and regulatory authorities are required to have a proactive role. In this context, recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the highest reward, in the history of its whistle-blower program, of $279 million to a whistle-blower. In this context, this article analyses the existing whistleblower regime in the US and other matured jurisdictions. It also assesses the Indian framework on whistleblowing. Lastly, it suggests effective and viable solutions to be incorporated into Indian legislation to make a strong and robust whistleblower policy in India.\n\nWhistle-blower Policy in US, UK, EU, and Singapore\n In the US, the Whistleblower Protection Act 1989, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, and the Dodd-Frank Act 2010 (DF Act) envisage provisions related to whistleblower. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) brought monetary as well as non-monetary protections for whistleblowers who report financial wrongdoings at publicly traded companies internally, whereas the DF Act specifically deals with the process for protecting and incentivising whistleblowers to report potential violations of Federal securities and commodities laws to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The DF Act has brought significant changes in the SOX as it expanded the definition of 'employee' to include employees of all subsidiaries and affiliates of public companies. It has also extended its protection to employees of private companies. Moreover, it has introduced a bounty program wherein if the information given by whistle-blower leads to enforcement action imposing sanctions of more than $1 million, the SEC is bound to pay minimum 10% to maximum 30% of the monetary sanctions collected. The eligibility criteria for bounty program is that information must be reported voluntarily and be original in nature. Additionally, the DF Act provides private right of actions to the whistleblower. \n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the DF Act, though, is that it threatens to undermine the internal corporate reporting. The DF Act provides that whistleblowers are required to provide information to the SEC to be eligible to the protections provided under it. However, the Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protections rules published by the SEC provides that the anti-retaliation protection provided under the DF Act would extend to employees of public companies and their subsidiaries who report information to persons or governmental authorities other than the commission. However, ultimately the SEC rules and the DF Act do not create a prerequisite in the form of mandatory prior internal reporting. Nevertheless, the overall picture available before us is that whistle-blower protection and the incentive provisions in USA are very robust as they provide hefty monetary rewards to whistleblowers, ensure their privacy, and protect them from retaliatory actions taken by their employers.\n\nIn the UK, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) was a pioneering step towards protecting whistleblowers from retaliation by employer. The PIDA provides that a whistleblower can bring a claim before the employment tribunal only after the employer has brought a retaliatory action against whistleblower for making disclosure. The statute does not provide for any incentive mechanism for whistleblower. However, recent practices adopted by regulatory authorities such as CMA and HMRC highlight that monetary incentives are being awarded to whistle-blowers under their respective legislations. Unlike the provisions in the USA, the fundamental principle of the PIDA is to promote internal corporate reporting by putting responsibility on employer to ensure that proper mechanism is in place for reporting and investigation of disclosure made by whistleblower. However, the statute has been heavily criticized for various reasons such as the Employment Tribunal not being an effective body to tackle these cases (as it takes nearly around two years to complete the whole proceeding and the success rate of whistleblower cases is very low). Also, there is no statutory obligation upon employer to put in place a whistleblowing policy. Taking into consideration all these inefficiencies in the system, it can be said that PIDA has failed to give adequate protection to whistle-blowers. Hence, to revamp this whole framework, the Office of the Whistleblower Bill has been introduced in the UK Parliament, although the same has not yet been passed. \n\nThe European Union in 2019 adopted the EU Whistleblower Directive. It proposes a very wide definition of whistleblowers by incorporating workers who work in either the public or the private sector. The directive has proposed a three-tier model of reporting, whereby the first level of reporting will be internal reporting, followed by an external reporting (i.e., to regulatory authorities etc.) and, lastly, public (media) reporting. Further, the views of the European Union on financial incentives to whistleblower are different from those in the US which is apparent from the text of the directive providing that it is upon the discretion of the member states to provide financial assistance to reporting persons. The discretion granted to member states reflects that the European Union is not in favour of granting mandatory financial incentives to whistleblower which is in contrast to the position adopted by the SEC. Nevertheless, the adoption of the ‘EU Whistleblower Directive’ is a welcome step in protecting whistleblowers in Europe.\n\nIn Singapore, there is no dedicated legislation for protection of whistleblowers, but it does not mean that no protection has been granted to whistleblowers. Legislations such as the Companies Act of Singapore, the Prevention of Corruption Act, and the Competition Act of Singapore contain provisions to protect whistleblowers. Moreover, the Code of Corporate Governance encourages listed companies to put in place a whistleblowing policy and inform employees about the process of reporting wrongdoings in the company. Furthermore, the Singapore Exchange Regulation mandates all issuers to implement a whistleblowing policy and mention the same in their annual reports and also explain their compliance with the said policy.  \n\nExisting Lacunas in the Indian Regulatory Framework over Whistleblowers\n\nThe Whistle Blowers Protection Act 2014 is the dedicated legislation that provides the process for reporting and protection of whistleblowers. The statute was passed by the Parliament, but it has not yet been brought into effect. Accordingly, we lack a specific legislation for whistle-blowers. However, we have different legal texts and guidelines in place for whistle blowing. For instance, Section 177 of the Companies Act 2013 read with Regulation 22 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018 (LODR) mandate listed companies to implement a vigil mechanism (whistleblowing policy). Moreover, Schedule V of the LODR provides that a listed company is required to disclose the implementation of a whistle blower policy and the extent to which they have complied with the same in their annual report. Such disclosure is a laudable step taken by the SEBI because it will boost the confidence of stakeholders, potential investors, and shareholders of the company regarding the corporate governance structure and the risk management mechanism in the company. Moreover, in 2020, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued an order whereby private companies of certain classes were mandated to disclose the details of whistleblower complaints to the auditor. However, the said order does not provide provisions for protection of whistleblowers in a private company.\n\nMoreover, the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Third  Amendment) Regulations 2019 introduced Clause IIIA whereby it made provisions for protection of whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information pertaining to violation of insider trading laws to SEBI. The amendment provides provisions for protection from retaliation and incentivising whistleblowers to report violation or potential violation of insider trading laws. Another important aspect of this amendment is that even if the whistleblower originally provides information to its internal legal compliance committee and subsequently notifies it to the SEBI, it will be eligible for reward by the regulator.\n\nHowever, the author has also found that there are some lacunas in the existing system. Firstly, it does not impose any civil or criminal liability on the officer in charge who takes retaliatory action against the whistleblower. Secondly, it provides that it is on the discretion of the SEBI to reward the whistleblower, hence even if the whistleblower provides a voluntary original information in good faith which leads to successful enforcement, he might not get the reward which is not the case in the US where it is mandatory upon SEC to reward whistleblowers who fulfill all the required criteria mentioned in the legislation. \n\nSuggestive Measures: A Way Forward \n\nThe author is of an opinion that there is a dire need to implement a legislation that provides adequate protection to whistleblowers in public unlisted as well as private companies. The legislation should also create a supervisory authority before whom an aggrieved whistleblower can file an appeal if the internal system of a company does not handle the complaint in a reasonable time or mishandles the complaint. To enhance the confidence in public interest whistleblowing, the supervisory authority, similar to other advisory bodies created by several international whistleblowing legislations, should provide advice, information, and support to public interest whistleblowers regarding disclosure of wrongdoing. If the authority finds it proper, it should be allowed to refer the complaints of whistleblowers to the concerned regulatory authorities for proper investigation. The legislation should also make provisions for monetary incentives to whistleblowers who report original information related to the commission of an offence in a public/private organisation which leads to a successful enforcement action. Additionally, the author proposes that either civil or criminal liability should be imposed on the person who imposes discriminatory/disadvantageous measures against the whistleblower because of his public interest whistleblowing.\n\nSecond, concerning the securities market, we already have a whistleblowing mechanism in place, but its scope and application is very narrow. The SEBI allows whistleblowers to directly report the violation of insider trading laws to it. Therefore, the author proposes that for other securities laws violations also, whistleblowers should be allowed to directly report to the SEBI. This will provide an alternative mode of reporting to whistleblowers and will extend to them the protection provided by the SEBI.\n Lastly, since the SEBI provides incentive in case of whistleblowing of violation of insider trading laws while there is absence of incentive provisions for whistleblowers in other cases, it is suggested that the SEBI brings incentive provisions in case of voluntary reporting of original information pertaining to violation of any securities laws in India leading to successful enforcement and use of the investor protection and education fund for rewarding whistleblowers.\nWhistleblowerCorporate GovernanceSEBI\nCorporate Law\n101 views\n1 like.

        "title": "India’s Carbon Credit Policy and the Greenwashing Conundrum",
        "content": "Dishaa Dand, Krishna Ravishankar\nJun 21\n7 min read\nIndia’s Carbon Credit Policy and the Greenwashing Conundrum\n[Dishaa is a student at Gujarat National Law University, and Krishna is a student at National Law University Jodhpur.]\n\n“We are in the fight for our lives. And we’re losing.” - António Guterres\n\nThe 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) served as a significant cautionary signal, reaffirming the urgent need for nations to intensify their efforts in addressing the pressing global challenge posed by the climate crisis. India, the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, has taken several measures to tackle this pressing issue. In 2022, India revised its Nationally Determined Contributions – in line with the ‘panchamrit’ goals proposed at COP26. This included reduction in carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030. At COP27, India submitted its Long Term Low Emission Development Strategy, reiterating reduction in carbon emissions as a major goal. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act 2022 (Amendment Act) was enacted by the Indian Government. Amending the Energy Conservation Act 2001 (Act), the Amendment Act emphasizes on decarbonization by empowering the centre to set-up a domestic carbon credit trading policy. In March 2023, the Union Ministry of Power released a draft of scheme, seeking comments from relevant stakeholders. \n\nThis article examines the Amendment Act, specifically the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (Scheme), within the concerns of greenwashing raised during the COP27 as well as the complexity in compliance with this scheme given the bureaucratic jujitsu the Amendment Act and the Scheme creates.\n\nCarbon Credits \n\nCarbon markets follow a cap-and-trade system wherein a cap on emissions is set by a regulator. To emit more than the established threshold, the company/individual needs to purchase a permit from the authority in the form a carbon credit certificate. These carbon credits are permits that allow individuals/companies to emit carbon dioxide over and above the permissible limit set by a governmental/regulatory body. Once a credit is purchased, it can be traded amongst one another, thus establishing a full-fledged carbon market. Each carbon credit is considered equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2). The idea is simple: to make carbon emissions expensive, thereby, disincentivising polluters from exceeding the emission limits.\n\n\nSource: www.climatepolicyinfohub.eu\n\nThere are two broad types of carbon markets – compliance markets and voluntary markets. Compliance markets are mandatory, created out of a national or international regulation while voluntary markets involve carbon credit trade on a voluntary basis. \n\nThe Act with Respect to the Scheme\n\nSection 14(w) of the Act empowers the Central Government in India to set-up a carbon trading scheme. The only other aspect of carbon trading dealt with in the Act is that such carbon credit certificates may be issued by the centre or by any authorized agency (under Section 2(da) of the Act). This open-endedness on the scheme has invited a host of concerns. First, no concrete definition of ‘carbon credits’ has been provided, leading to ambiguity in its scope. Second, the discourse abounds with questions regarding the regulation of the market. The Ministry of Power's competence in implementing the scheme is being called into question. Sectors like agriculture and industrial processes, which are significant sources of emissions, presents a complex challenge to the Ministry's capacity to manage and regulate this expanded market. Third, most trading systems are regulated by independent sectoral regulators, e. g. SEBI, CERC, etc. The Act does not afford any clarity on any such body. \n\nAnother point of contention is that existing policies such as the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) and Energy Saving Certificates, which have also been developed to reduce carbon emissions, may overlap with this scheme under a different name. \n\nProposed Scheme\n\nThe Ministry of Power recently came up with the Scheme, providing some solutions to the concerns raised. \n\nFirstly, there would be compliance and voluntary trading mechanisms. The present PAT scheme would be transitioned into the compliance market, averting the problems of overlapping policies. Other, non-obligated sectors may trade in these credits to meet carbon neutrality goals, constituting the voluntary market. Secondly, an interconnected, cross-sectoral regulatory mechanism has been proposed, under which Indian Carbon Market (ICM) Governing Board is to be set-up, for governing the Indian carbon market. This board shall be chaired by the Secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The designated authority for issuance of certificates shall also be recommended by this board. The market shall be administered by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, also serving as the Secretariat of the board. The regulator of trading activities in the carbon market would be Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. It is proposed that the Indian Energy Exchange or Power Exchange India Limited would manage the trading and exchange platform. The Power System Operation Corporation Limited, which currently handles the registry of renewable energy credits, could continue to be responsible for the ICM registry.\n\n\nSource: Draft Carbon Market Policy\n\nWhile the Scheme could be deemed as a commendable effort at establishing a carbon market for India, the governance structure could be a matter of concern. Extremely complicated structures like such pose threats in the form of bureaucratic hurdles and reduced efficiency. The multi-tiered nature could also make it susceptible to clashes between the different organs, especially between the administrator and regulator. \n\nThe biggest question that remains however, is whether this concept of carbon market is actually beneficial or is merely a greenwashing gimmick.  \n\nGreenwashing: The Gordian Knot of the Carbon Credits\n\nAs the UN task force headed by Catherine McKenna was formed to revisit the standards and practices required for private sector entities to comply with, in order to make sure they fulfil their net zero pledges, a recommendation from this task force also states that there must be less reliance placed on carbon offsets via carbon trading. However as seen in COP-27, more emphasis was laid on negotiating standards for global carbon credit rating markets pushed by John Kerry, the United States Envoy on Climate Change by pushing a new two-tier for carbon offset reading through the system of mitigating contributions. One of the concerns raised, especially by small island nations, is aptly summed up in Matt William’s (the head of the London-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit) remark which reads as follows: \n\n\"If they (mitigating contributions) are used by the private sector as offsets, we might kid ourselves we’ve achieved net zero when we haven’t by any stretch.” \n\nThe underlying premise is the problem of what climate scientists associate carbon credits with - greenwashing. \n\nDefined first in 1986 by climate scientist Jay Westerveld, greenwashing is when a business or group spends more resources on portraying itself as environmentally friendly than on actually reducing its negative impact on the environment. Companies mainly engage in Greenwashing due to either increased customer perception (especially among Gen Z users) of the company’s operations being ethical when they comply by sustainability standards as pointed in this recent Nielson’s Global Corporate Sustainability Report or because of sheer ignorance and lack of technical know-how.\n\nCarbon credits or offsets manifest this process of greenwashing when businesses double count carbon credits, neglect to prioritise internal emissions reduction, or purchase unverified credits.  A case in point of double counting of carbon credits wherein both the company as well as the government account for the offset leading to two entries is as seen in the case of the Environmental Défense Fund Report. Examples of non-prioritising internal emissions can be seen in the case of the Virgin Atlantic’s Oddar Meanchey program which though promoted afforestation practices, had engaged in more deforestation that the emissions which were reduced through these carbon credits reversed. \n\nThere are essentially three levels of greenwashing: (a) zero-level greenwashing; (b) moderate-level greenwashing; and (c) severe-level greenwashing. While zero and moderate level greenwashing have some effect on reducing carbon emissions, greenwashing of a severe level has the complete opposite consequence. \n\nInternational Perspectives\n\nIt is important to look at certain foreign experiences to learn drawbacks seen in other carbon credit regimes. A study commissioned by the European Union in 2016 showed that 3/4th of UN-offset projects were unlikely to result in actual carbon emissions reduction despite the purchase of more carbon credits. Similarly, as seen in Australia, providing carbon credits to heavy carbon emitting industries like landfill gas industries, there was alleged misuse of carbon credit offsets which could have been regulated through other deterrent legislative measures.\n\nBoth the Amendment Act and the Scheme do not incorporate the challenges of greenwashing as a phenomenon that come along with the tide of introducing the carbon credit trading policy. Moreover, the current policy scheme which can be seen as an extension of the PAT scheme allows for carbon credit offsets even in cases energy intensive industries which could otherwise be regulated through deterrence rather than incentivization. The Scheme lists obligated sectors to include petroleum refineries, iron and steel, fertilisers, and chlor alkali which, according to the International Economic Agency, contribute 7-9% of carbon emissions even in developed countries in spite established carbon credit offset norms. \n\nConclusion\n\nTherefore, as seen from above, the ICM could be a ‘bane’. To transform this into a boon, the following is proposed. Firstly, the intricate governing structure holds potential to be simplified. One viable approach would be to establish a sole regulator similar to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which would entail regulation as well as administration. Secondly, the problem of greenwashing needs to be tackled. A first plausible approach would be to look at carbon credits as supplements to more deterrent control measures such as carbon taxes or emission regulating legislations, rather than looking at them as the main measures of emission control. However, if the policy discourse is to be carbon credit centric, a second plausible approach is to ensure that high-emission sectors undertake zero-to-moderate level greenwashing by adopting a carrot and stick model - enforcing strict laws to reduce emissions at source as well as incentivising them to participate in the carbon market to offset the remainder of emissions. Finally, along the lines of legislation proposed by the European Commission, a transparency and accountability mechanism must be established to put an end to greenwashing tactics. Companies that would make claims of carbon neutrality must report to the regulator about actual efforts to reduce emissions and their use of carbon offsets, with the regulator being in charge of inspections. \nCOP27GreenwashingCarbon Credit PolicyEnergy Conservation (Amendment) Act 2022\nLaw and Policy\n882 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Ensuring Fair Play: A Call for Competition Oversight in the Gaming Industry",
        "content": "Shivansh Shukla\nJun 16\n6 min read\nEnsuring Fair Play: A Call for Competition Oversight in the Gaming Industry\n[Shivansh is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nThe rise of the gaming industry across the globe has gone somewhat under the radar. Traditionally viewed as a mere hobby for children, gaming has become a gigantic industry which was worth USD 232.02 billion in 2022, and is predicted to cross the USD 500 billion mark by 2030. In India alone, it stands at USD 2.8 billion, and is expected to increase at a remarkable rate of 30%. The gaming industry has become a major economic sector as well as a crucial area for innovation. It is indeed the new \"happening\" place in the global market, with hordes of conglomerates and big names trying to enter the fold, seeking to benefit from the increasing potential of this market. It is also heavily linked to other sectors like artificial intelligence, metaverse and virtual reality. The arrival of big players in new industries is almost sure to ring competition alarm bells, and the gaming industry is no exception to the trend. It has thus become crucial to prevent undistorted competition in the relevant markets associated with this industry. This piece explores the growth of the gaming industry and argues for the need for active competition oversight in this new market.\n\nThe Need for Competition Oversight\n\nThe alarm bells for competition law\n The gaming industry has become a battleground for the market behemoths—Microsoft and Sony. The two companies lead the gaming console market with their products, Xbox and PlayStation, respectively. Microsoft recently entered into a USD 68.7 billion agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard. The deal is expected to give Microsoft a significant market share in the cloud-gaming business and control over popular gaming titles like Call of Duty, giving it a massive advantage over its competitors, Sony and Nintendo. The concerned market regulators are split in regard to the matter, with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) being against the deal and the European Commission favouring it. \n\nThe principal concerns surrounding the agreement revolve around Microsoft’s dominant position in the realm of cloud gaming and the potential adverse effects on competition in the distribution of PC and console games, should the acquisition proceed. Furthermore, apprehensions have been raised about the potential dearth of innovation and limited options for gamers that could result from the deal. Microsoft’s competitor Sony also expressed fear that the deal will potentially allow Microsoft to increase the pricing of Call of Duty and confine its availability exclusively to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service. Moreover, there were concerns that Microsoft might diminish the quality and performance of Call of Duty on PlayStation, thereby eroding the gaming community’s trust in PlayStation as the preferred platform for playing the game. Microsoft was thus made to resort to behavioural remedies, including offering 10-year licensing agreements to ensure that European consumers can continue to play the future titles on a cloud-gaming service of their choice. \n\nThere have been other instances of competition concerns in the industry as well. Sony has been alleged to have abused its dominant position by charging excessive prices and imposing unfair terms and conditions on the use of its PlayStation store by charging a flat 30% from developers seeking to sell games on its store. Similarly, the European Commission fined Valve for geo-blocking practices after finding that the company had restricted cross-border sales of games based on the geographical location of its users. Another interesting case study is that of Epic v. Apple. Apple mandated app developers to use its payment service while selling their goods on the App Store, and charged a commission fee of up to 30%. The gaming industry thus stands vulnerable to conduct that tends to be anti-competitive, and this trend seems to be increasing with time.\n\nPotential competition issues in the gaming industry\n\nSince the gaming industry has largely escaped regulatory scrutiny, especially in terms of competition law, it has led to the prevalence of excessively priced video games, which can be considered exploitative to consumers. The gaming sector is also home to fierce races between competitors over acquiring licenses, many of which are exclusive in nature. Securing the license to employ widely recognized characters, franchises, teams or universes enables developers to make games that appeal to both current and potential players, providing a substantial competitive edge over its competitors. These races have thus resulted in the exit of franchises from the market and reduced competition. For instance, after the exit of Pro Evolution Soccer from the market, EA FIFA has become overwhelmingly dominant in the football video games sector. A monopolistic position is followed by the mistreatment of consumers and the dominant enterprise becoming unresponsive to consumer needs while continuing to enjoy high profits. This trend exists in multiple relevant markets of video games, ranging from basketball, Formula 1, and WWE games. \n\nGaming rivalries, i.e., competition between franchises, foster a responsive and innovative market, furthering the interests and desires of the public. The gaming industry is also subject to network effects wherein new consumers are more likely to enter the already dominant gaming community. Moreover, the delineation of relevant markets is such that the most popular game in a genre tends to become super-dominant. In the event of foreclosure of access to a particular gaming series or imposition of a discriminatory condition on platforms where the game can be purchased, the relevant market for the inquiry will have to be defined precisely because a football series cannot be substituted by a non-footballing game, especially since an entire community of gamers of a particular game exists for that particular genre and substitutes simply do not exist. Exclusionary conduct invariably results in high concentration and dominance levels of popular franchises, giving them a super-dominant position in their respective relevant market. There thus exist practices in the gaming industry that deserve a look from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) so as to have enhanced competition in the industry.\n\nProtecting Indian Gaming Start-Ups\n\nThe gaming industry is an important contributor to the economy, and healthy, spirited competition can only benefit the market. India is focusing on promoting domestic gaming start-ups, and it is crucial to prevent them from potential anti-competitive impacts and practices. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has already asserted that competition law can be an effective tool to promote public policy objectives. To that end, an active competition law regime will facilitate market entry for small and independent developers in the gaming industry by preventing barriers to entry that may be imposed by dominant players, as was attempted by Microsoft and Sony in the aforementioned examples. These barriers could include restrictive licensing agreements, exclusive partnerships, or predatory pricing strategies. By eliminating such anti-competitive practices, competition law ensures that small developers have a fair opportunity to bring their games to the market and compete on the basis of their creativity and quality. CCI has the power to inquire into alleged anti-competitive practices on its own motion under Section 19(1) of the Competition Act 2002 (Act). A proactive use of this power shall not only foster a vibrant ecosystem where new and innovative ideas can flourish, but will also ensure that the interests of developers and gamers are protected by promoting a diverse range of gaming experiences.\n\nCCI can examine agreements within the gaming industry under Section 3 of the Act. For instance, it can analyse vertical agreements between game development studios and console manufacturers using a rule of reason analysis. This enables CCI to evaluate the overall impact of such agreements, as mandated by Section 19(3) of the Act, taking into consideration both pro-competitive benefits and potential anti-competitive effects, to ascertain whether such agreements have an appreciable adverse effect on competition. CCI can also examine the activities of dominant players in the market should they be suspected of abusing their dominant position. Notably, Section 4 of the Act does not differentiate between exploitative and exclusionary conduct, thereby encompassing both types of actions if they can be traced back to a dominant enterprise. CCI thus possesses the authority to thoroughly examine cases where exclusionary behaviour or denial of market access, as illustrated in the earlier example of football games, or the imposition of excessive prices by Sony, occur. Additionally, CCI can scrutinise combinations in the gaming industry under Section 5, akin to the assessments carried out by the CMA and the European Commission in Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The considerations taken into account by the CMA and the European Commission closely align with the analysis of combinations under Section 20(4) of the Act, indicating that any examination conducted by CCI in the gaming market is likely to adopt a similar approach. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary objective of this article is not to assert that all the aforementioned practices are inherently anti-competitive. Instead, it aims to highlight the inherent vulnerability of the rapidly expanding gaming industry to potentially anti-competitive practices. The article advocates for the implementation of active competition oversight in order to mitigate market barriers and protect consumers from exploitation. By recognising the remarkable growth and potential of the gaming sector, it becomes evident that proactive measures are necessary to safeguard against anti-competitive behaviour and ensure a fair and equitable market environment.\nCompetition ActGamingCCI\nCompetition Law\n265 views\n4 likes.

        "content": "Vaishnavi Chandrakar\nJun 15\n7 min read\nUnveiling Non-Taxability of Compensation Payment to Cricket South Africa under the India-SA DTAA\n[Vaishnavi is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nIn the recent case of BCCI v. Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Mumbai has ruled that the compensation payment made to Cricket South Africa (CSA) under the termination agreement by BCCI is not subject to taxation, in accordance with the provisions outlined in the India-South Africa Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). \n\nThis piece delves into the intricate facets of the judgment, with an analysis focusing on two pivotal aspects: the 2018 amendment that transformed the taxability of compensation previously deemed as capital receipts and the revised definition of 'business connection' under the Finance Act 2018, aligning it with the modified PE rule of the OECD Multilateral Instrument (MLI) and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan 7.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nFrom 2008 to 2014, the BCCI (the appellant/assessee) organized an annual cricket tournament called Champions League T20 (CLT20), in which domestic teams of various countries participated. In collaboration with CSA, the assessee devised an arrangement wherein CSA ensured the participation of winning and runner-up cricket teams from their domestic Twenty20 Cricket competition in CLT20. As part of this agreement, the assessee committed to paying a predetermined participation fee to CSA each year for the participation of teams from their jurisdiction.\n\nConsequently, the assessee and CSA entered into a termination agreement in 2015, cancelling the previous arrangement which required CSA to guarantee the participation of teams from South Africa in CLT20. Clause 5 of the agreement stipulated that if the assessee organizes a similar tournament within four years, CSA will facilitate the participation of at least two South African teams. Clause 6 explicitly prohibits CSA from involvement in any tournament similar to CLT20.\n\nThe assessee agreed to pay CSA a compensation amount of USD 22,696,000 for the termination of CLT20 and CSA’s obligations. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (CIT(A)) held that this payment of compensation should be taxed as 'income from business' under Section 28(va) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (Act). The assessee appealed this decision before the ITAT. The central issue in this appeal is whether the compensation amount is taxable.\n\nDelving into the Contours of the Judgement\n\nThe ITAT has ruled that the compensation payment made to CSA under the termination agreement is not subject to taxation and TDS deduction under Section 195 of the Act.\n\nAmidst delivering the verdict, the court expounded upon the intricacies of the following facets:\n\nThe receipt of compensation by CSA is not attributable to any operation carried out in India\n\nThe assessee argued that CSA had no obligation to ensure team participation after the termination of the arrangement, resulting in no services provided by CSA in India. They also claimed that the non-compete clause under clause 6 of the agreement, if applicable, would apply outside India. This is because if the assessee organizes any tournaments in India, under clause 5, CSA would be required to ensure the participation of teams in such tournaments.\n\nThe court considered the arguments and relevant sections of the Act. Section 5(2)(a) mentions the total income of a non-resident which includes income received in India. However, it was deemed inapplicable as the compensation was not received in India. Regarding Section 5(2)(b), it is explained in Section 9 that income deemed to accrue or arise in India includes income derived from business connections, property, assets, or sources in India. However, Explanation 1(a) to Section 9(1)(i) clarifies that only the portion of income reasonably attributable to operations carried out in India is deemed to accrue or arise in India for taxation purposes. \n\nThe court concluded that the arrangement between CSA and the assessee for team participation in the T20 league was terminated. No matches of CLT20 took place anywhere, including in India. Therefore, no services were rendered for facilitating team participation.\n\nRegarding compensation as non-compete fees, the court held that the non-compete clause applied outside India. Since the payment did not arise from operations in India, it is not taxable under Section 9(1) of the Act. The court concluded that the compensation paid to CSA for terminating the arrangement is a non-taxable capital receipt.\n\nCSA’s lack of permanent establishment in India in view of Article 7 of the DTAA between India and South Africa\n\nThe CIT(A) held that the assessee acted as a Dependent Agent Permanent Establishment (DAPE) for CA, CSA, and other teams participating in CLT20, making CSA's income taxable in India. The assessee argued that as regards DAPE, the revenue failed to prove the fulfilment of conditions under the tax treaty. Additionally, the assessee is not an agent of CSA and lacks the authority to finalize contracts on their behalf. Hence, without a permanent establishment (PE) of CSA in India, the compensation for discontinuing CLT20 cannot be taxed in India.\n\nThe court delved into the relevant articles of DTAA between India- South Africa. According to Article 7 of the DTAA, the income of an enterprise is taxable in the contracting state if it operates through a PE in the other state. The revenue claimed that CSA had a dependent agent in India, making the compensation taxable. To determine if CSA had a DAPE in India under the DTAA, the court analysed Article 5(5), which states that for an enterprise to be deemed to have a PE, a person acting on its behalf must have the authority to conclude contracts in the contracting state and habitually exercise that authority. \n\nIn the present case, the revenue failed to provide evidence that the assessee had the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of CSA and habitually exercised that authority. Thus, the revenue did not meet the burden of proof required to establish the fulfilment of the twin conditions stated in Article 5(5) of the DTAA. Therefore, the court held that the payment of compensation to CSA under the termination agreement is not taxable under the DTAA, and the assessee is not required to deduct tax at source under Section 195 of the Act.\n\nEvaluating Taxation Implications: Analysis of Compensation Receipts and Modified PE Rule\n\nNavigating the 2018 amendment: Impact on taxation of compensation receipts\n\nThe argument put forth by revenue is that the agreement is a non-compete agreement, as CSA had agreed not to engage in any tournament like CLT20. Therefore, the payment is taxable as business income/non-compete fee under Section 28(va) of the Act. \n\nHowever, the grounds as to the taxable nature of compensation under Section 28(ii)(e) were not raised in the case. The omission can be attributed to the fact that the assessment year in the above case is 2016-17, and clause (e) was inserted in Section 28(ii) by the 2018 amendment (with effect from 1 April 2019). This raises an intriguing aspect of the case, as it necessitates an analysis from this perspective. The 2018 amendment had a significant impact that altered the taxation of compensation previously considered capital receipts and overturned numerous judicial precedents.\nIn the present case, the court held that compensation paid to CSA for terminating the arrangement is a capital receipt, hence not taxable. In the case of CIT v. Raj Bahadur Jairam, it was held that the compensation received for the termination of a business agreement should be treated as taxable business income unless the termination leads to the loss of the income source. In the present case, CLT20 was terminated entirely, hence there was the loss of a source of income. Therefore, it is undisputed that compensation was a capital receipt. \n\nHowever, according to Section 28(ii)(e), any compensation received by a person in connection with the termination or modification of a business contract is taxable under the head 'profits and gains of business or profession'. Before 2018 amendment, compensation received for breach of contract was treated as a capital receipt and was not liable to be taxed. However, with the inclusion of clause (e) in Section 28(ii), compensation received or expected for terminating a contract is now taxable, regardless of whether it is a capital receipt or a revenue receipt.\n\nFurther, in a similar case of Sai Mirra Innopharm Private Limited v. ITO, the court determined that the compensation received for the premature termination of a contract manufacturing agreement was considered a capital receipt, representing the loss of profit from the business or investment. The ruling further clarified that until the assessment year 2019-20, compensation received for the termination of any agreement was not subject to taxation under section 28(ii)(e) of the Act.\n\nTherefore, per the author, considering the current jurisprudence, the defence of compensation being a capital receipt might not stand, given the impact under Section 28(ii)(e). \n\nRedefined business connections: Analysing the modified PE rule and its implications\n\nThe CIT(A) concluded that the assessee qualifies as the DAPE of CSA based on factors such as representation in the CLT20 Governing Council and acting as an agent for multiple teams participating in CLT20. The CIT(A) deemed the income of CSA to have accrued and arisen in India.\n\nAccording to Section 9 of the Act, income derived from business connections, property, assets, or sources in India is deemed to accrue or arise in India for taxation purposes. However, Explanation 1(a) to Section 9(1)(i) clarifies that only the portion of income reasonably attributable to operations carried out in India is taxable. The court rightly held that since CLT20 was discontinued and no services were rendered in facilitating the participation of teams in the Tournament, therefore no operations were carried out in India and the assessee is not a DAPE of CSA.\n\nHowever, the scope of 'business connection' was amended by the Finance Act of 2018 to align with the MLI and BEPS Action Plan 7. The amended definition includes 'business activities carried on by a non-resident through dependent agents and any business activities carried through a person acting on behalf of the non-resident, who habitually concludes contracts by the non-resident'. Therefore, it becomes interesting to analyse the present case from the perspective of this modified definition.\n\nConsidering the law, the amended definition of 'business connection' includes the requirement of habitually concluding contracts or playing the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non-resident. According to Taxation scholar, Klaus Vogel, a general authority cannot be assumed if the agent's authority is limited to pre-determined prices and terms set by the principal, without any decision-making power.  However, there is no evidence provided by the Revenue to establish that the assessee had the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of CSA and habitually exercised that authority.\n\nIn similar cases of SAS Institute (India) Private Limited v. ACIT and In Re AL NISR Publishing, it was held that compensation received by foreign companies for loss of business/profit would be considered business receipts, but no TDS would be deducted if the foreign companies do not have a PE in India. Furthermore, the AL NISR Publishing case establishes that an agent representing multiple principals and providing similar services without exclusivity does not have an agency PE in India.\n\nApplying these principles, the assessee's role as an agent for multiple teams in CLT20 and the absence of authority to conclude contracts on behalf of CSA, it can be concluded that even when considering the amended definition of 'business connection,' the assessee would not be deemed as a DAPE of CSA.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 tax law amendments have brought about significant changes to taxation jurisprudence, expanding the scope of taxable income, and redefining the concept of business connection. These amendments align with international standards and aim to tackle tax avoidance. Overall, the amendments have necessitated a revaluation of tax positions and increased compliance requirements in line with the revised framework.\nTaxationDTAAPermanent EstablishmentBCCICricket South Africa\nTaxation Law\n105 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "Winning Entry: Freeze-Out Mergers in Indian Corporate Law",
        "content": "Baibhabi Tripathy\nJun 13\n8 min read\nWinning Entry: Freeze-Out Mergers in Indian Corporate Law\n[The following post has been authored by Baibhabi Tripathy, student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune, and the second winner in the IRCCL Blog Writing Competition 2022-23.]\n\nThe benefits that controlling stakeholders bring to their companies have been the subject of much debate, as have the risks that minority shareholders face when their company is run by a controller who may be motivated more by personal gain than by the company's success. Freeze-outs occur when the controlling shareholder engages in a transaction to forcibly buy the remaining shares of the company held by the minority shareholders. For situations where general agreement among stakeholders is not possible, business structures like 'majority-owned and controlled corporations' have emerged as a workaround. This notion, which has its origins in the precedent-setting case of Foss v. Harbottle, is grounded in the central premise of corporate democracy, which holds that it is up to the will of the majority to decide what is in the best interest of the company. \n\nIn India, freeze out regulation is a novel concept, but due to its significance, it is attracting a great deal of attention. Given that most businesses in India are managed, the potential of more freeze outs is extremely high. Despite this and the growing number of reform proposals, there has not yet been a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the current law and potential reform measures in the rather distinctive institutional and corporate setting of India. This study analyses the regulatory experience of other major jurisdictions and proposes a new set of regulatory freeze out measures for India to consider.\n\nUnderstanding the Notion of Freeze-Outs\n\nThe phrase 'freeze-out' often refers to the forced acquisition of the minority's equity shares for a 'fair' price set in line with the terms of the Companies Act 2013 and the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements, and Amalgamations) Rules 2016. Regardless of their form, freeze outs raise concerns for corporate law because the controller can determine the timing and price of the freeze out, even against the wishes of the minorities, because in most jurisdictions, approving a freeze out only requires a majority vote in its favour, which a controller can typically obtain. This increases the likelihood that the controller will engage in exploitative conduct towards the minority groups.\n\nPresent Laws Regulating Freeze-Outs in India\n\nSection 395 of the Companies Act 1956 established a restricted procedure for a minority freeze-out for a transferee firm, based on the goals of the act. This mechanism is activated when at least 90% of the shareholders of the firm whose shares are being purchased approve a scheme or contract involving the transfer of shares between two companies. In such situations, the transferee business has the ability to eliminate minority shareholders.\n\nIn the same vein as Section 395 of the Companies Act 1956, Section 235 of the Companies Act 2013 permits a corporation to acquire shares from dissident shareholders using a scheme or contract that has been accepted by the majority of shareholders. This provision is patterned after Section 395 of the Companies Act 1956. It is important to note that under Sections 235(2) and 235(3) of the Companies Act 2013, minority owners who disagree with the compulsory acquisition of their shares can file an objection with the NCLT. An attempt was made in AIG (Mauritius) LLC v. Tata Tele Ventures to interpret Section 395 of the Companies Act 1956, a provision identical to Section 235 of the Companies Act 2013, in a way that maintains the principle of shareholder democracy in India. It was noted that the interests of the dissentients and the offeror must be materially different to the majority in order for the majority's vote to be validly overridden, and this is consistent with the Section's logic.\n\nAlongside Section 235, a second new provision, Section 236, addressing the 'purchase of minority shareholding', has been added to the Companies Act 2013. For a majority shareholder or shareholders to use Section 236, the NCLAT decided that one of the events enumerated in Section 236(1) must have occurred. This means that the majority shareholder must own or acquire at least 90% of the company's shares 'through virtue of a merger, share exchange, conversion of securities, or for any other cause'. In light of this precedent, it was determined that 'for any other reason' should be interpreted ejusdem generis with the preceding phrases and would only include events that are comparable to a merger, share exchange, or conversion of securities.\n\nIn addition to the restricted mechanism permitted by Section 235, corporations have employed mechanisms such as selective capital reduction (in conformity with Section 66 of the Companies Act 2013) for minority freeze-outs. Further, in accordance with the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulation 2021, listed companies have the option of delisting their equity shares.\n\nSeparately, in India, freeze-outs are governed by the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements, and Amalgamations) Amendment Rules 2020 and Sections 230(11) and (12) of the Companies Act 2013, both of which were recently notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.\n\nGuarding the Interests of Minority Shareholders\n\nMinority freeze-outs are essentially a means to seize the property of lawful minority stockholders. Expropriation of private property is widely seen as having been made more acceptable by the fact that freeze-outs can be used as evidence in court. As per the principle of proprietary interest, which states that all shareholders have a proprietary interest in the corporation and must be protected against attempts to prevent their peaceful enjoyment of property, freeze-outs may be seen as a violation of this principle. \n\nThis can have a number of effects on the minority shareholders, including the following: \n\nThe minority shareholders are less likely to become minority shareholders of any company because they do not trust the management and are afraid of being frozen out of the company without their profits.\nThe minority shareholder would refrain from investing since they do not perceive an adequate security against this freeze-out, as it just requires majority votes.\nThe minority would perceive the discounts when purchasing specific shares as an indication that they will eventually be shut out of the enterprise; as a result, their confidence wanes.\nThis conduct on the part of minority shareholders would reduce the company's capital and make it exceedingly challenging to obtain cash.\nTypically, the performance of a corporation is evaluated simply from an economic standpoint. Maximizing profits is a desirable objective, but it cannot be accomplished in violation of some laws. Therefore, the maximization of profits cannot be used as an argument against the rights of minority shareholders. Thus, the principal function of a regulation that governs minority freeze-outs is to deal with and maintain a balance between the majority and minority shareholders' interests.\n\nRegulatory Framework of Other Comparable Jurisdictions\n\nDue to the fact that minority shareholders are not effectively safeguarded during freeze outs, an investigation in the regulatory frameworks of other jurisdictions to acquire insight into how this issue could be addressed is pertinent. \n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Companies Act of 2006 in the United Kingdom permits the acquirer to 'freeze out' minority shareholders by means broadly comparable to those used in India, including forced acquisition, strategy, and capital reduction. While the borders and processes of Indian and English laws are comparable, the legal interpretation and the minority shareholder rights are distinct. Freeze outs that are implemented in a way that harms the interests of minorities have been deemed invalid by English courts.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, opportunism on the part of managers toward shareholders is one of the most prevalent types of corporate behavior found in relation to agency issues. Due to challenges with agency and the prevalence of family-owned company conglomerates in India, it is interesting to study minority shareholder protection in nations with comparable corporate ownership structures and difficulties with concentrated shareholding to India's.\n\nAustralia\n\nAnother illuminating example comes from Australia, where minority shareholders can lawfully oppose a majority vote at a general meeting if they believe it constitutes 'fraud' against them. In India, where a 'majority of the minority' vote is sufficient to pass a capital reduction bill, even if those voters harbor prejudices against the interests of a minority, this could be a useful instrument. The takeover mechanism established by Australia's Corporations Act 2001 prioritizes fairness, equality of opportunity, and protection of minority shareholders more than economic efficiency.\n\nSingapore\n\nRegarding freeze outs, Singapore follows the United Kingdom's example. The three methods available to freeze out the target are: compulsory acquisition by acceptance of at least 90% of the shares for which an offer has been made, scheme of arrangement, and capital reduction. In addition, Singaporean regulators have opted for compulsory purchase or scheme of arrangement rather than capital reduction.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that minority shareholders of businesses outside India are afforded protections in freeze out transactions that are unavailable in India. No suitable regulatory or judicial checks and balances have been implemented to avoid the devaluing of disadvantaged groups or the abuse of concentrated authority.\n\nPossible Amendments\n\nMinority protection in freeze out deals in India appears to be relatively lax. Thus, it appears that reforming freeze out regulations is an effective means of enhancing minority protection.\n\nMoM votes\n\nNumerous countries appear to give freeze outs more deference if they are supported by a majority of the minority (MoM) vote. While India is gradually implementing MoM for related-party transactions, its applicability to freeze outs is currently restricted. Nevertheless, even if MoM votes were mandated by law, the question remains as to whether such a rule would be helpful in defending minorities. Some larger minorities may not vote in the same direction as other minorities. Yet additional worry with MoM voting is inherent coercion - the perception stated in some US cases that minorities may vote in favour of transactions (which harm them) out of fear that the controller would find other (more harmful) ways to take value from the company if they do not.\n\nSEBI as a regulating body \n\nAnother conceivable reform would be to give SEBI more control over freeze outs. Both the MoM plan and the fiduciary action approach require smaller minorities to take action, which can be difficult given their size. Increasing the authority of SEBI mitigates some of the deficiencies of these two systems, which both require smaller minorities to take action. It may be advantageous to have the regulator serve as an additional layer of defense.\n\nExamination by an entirely independent board of directors \n\nIn some jurisdictions, the approval of a freeze out rests more heavily on the shoulders of an independent special committee of directors than on those of the entire board. Although the use of special independent committees for conflicted transactions (such as freeze outs) has not been widespread in India, this is likely to change in the near future as a result of the increased emphasis in the Companies Act 2013 on board independence and SEBI's efforts to increase the reliance on independent directors. Although this has not occurred in the past, it is likely to occur in the future. Freeze outs, which position controllers in direct conflict with minorities, cannot have a greater influence than they do. This is because independent directors on Indian business boards are willing to assume expanded duties and responsibilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nFreeze out is an example of a sort of controller transaction that has the potential to be destructive to minority groups. An analysis of the legislation governing minority freeze-out and takeovers in different nations reveals that the level of protection afforded to minority shareholders in India is insufficient. It would be imprudent to rely exclusively on India's courts to safeguard minority shareholders during freeze-outs, as these courts have a history of favouring the company's promoters. This prejudice takes the shape of a general refusal to intervene in the internal affairs of a firm, with a few exceptions, so long as the majority supports the resolutions. \n\nOther protections that are derived from international best practices, such as granting minority shareholders the ability to challenge a resolution in a general meeting if it constitutes a fraud on them; requiring a 'majority of the minority' vote to effect a freeze-out; or giving SEBI greater powers of investigation and adjudication to regulate freeze-outs, since it has greater financial and commercial expertise than regular courts, are all things that need to be implemented. The major concern is deciding which solutions to pursue in light of the realities on the ground and the institutional constraints in India. \n\nIn the context of Indian culture, a combination of more regulatory oversight and voting rights or other safeguards is perhaps the most ideal approach. There are a number of modifications that could be considered to better the balance between the protection of minority and the encouragement of value-enhancing freeze outs; however, these modifications are still pending for future work.\nCompanies ActFreeze-OutMergers\nCorporate Law\n439 views\n1 like.

        "content": "Utkarsh Mani Tripathi\nJun 13\n9 min read\nWinning Entry: Evaluating Freezeout Mergers and Burden of Proof in Indian Corporate Law\n[The following post has been authored by Utkarsh Mani Tripathi, student at NALSAR University of Law, and the third winner in the IRCCL Blog Writing Competition 2022-23.]\n\nMinority oppression is the unfortunate corollary to the predominance of the majority rule in corporate governance. Whereas the decision-making process of a company is often likened to a democracy, it ignores the significant coercion that the majority shareholders might, willingly or not, exert on the minority.\n\nAn example of this can be found in freezeout mergers, where the majority shareholders of a company buy out the shares of the minority, often through legal caprice, ejecting them from their interest in the corporate entity. Majority shareholders have attempted such mergers for several reasons, the chief among them being: \nreducing minority control;\nreducing public shareholding as a means of going private (in order to avoid observing the SEBI regulations);\ninformational privacy; and\nlocking away the minority holder from sharing in potential profits. \nA freezeout merger could prove to be one of the most elaborate examples of structuring of transactions. To be sure, litigation involving such mergers is rare in India. Most minority squeeze-outs are done through more direct means, such as share consolidation, and others. Freezeout merger could very well be the next frontier of minority oppression in India, and existing provisions have only limited minority protections.\n\nAs with other example of minority oppression, Indian courts are likely to put the burden of proof on the petitioner, the minority shareholder, requiring them to prove the unfairness of a specific merger which they feel is against their interests. This burden of proof may belie the actual forces exerted by the majority over the minority holders, and its impact on intra-corporate trust. This piece will analyse whether the burden of proof in litigations involving freezeout mergers should be placed on the minority shareholders. Further, it proposes some new measures to reform the procedure in order to introduce fairness and accountability.\n\nThe Modus Operandi of a Freezeout Merger\n\nLet us consider the example of the majority shareholder attempting to prevent the minority shareholders from partaking in the additional potential profits from an impending transaction. They may do this so as to acquire all the profits themselves and exclude the minority shareholders. Such a scenario is easily foreseeable in countries such as India which have traditionally had a corporate regime with concentrated and entrenched majorities.\n\nIn order to undertake the removal of the minority holders (the public shareholders) from the rolls of the company, the majority shareholders set up another company – a shell company – which has no shares of its own. This company is then made to initiate a merger process with the original company. As only the majority holders are interested in such a transaction, they vote in favour of the transaction, and the dissenting minority holders are instead offered a compensation for the cancellation of their shares. This ends up with the entire control and shareholding of the new company effectively in the hands of the majority shareholders. \n\nThe impact of such freezeout mergers on the minority shareholders is immense. Besides the obvious consequences associated with shareholding financials, it also destroys the minority’s legitimate expectations of a share in the company’s profitable transactions. Besides these unrealized gains, the minority shareholders are also affected by often unfair buyout prices, ending up being short-changed for the value of their shares. \n\nHence, the procedure of freezeout mergers has acquired significant ill-repute among minority shareholders. \n\nShould Freezeout Mergers be Banned?\n\nIt must be noted that, keeping in mind the ill-effects of such mergers noted above, minority holders are actionably worse off only when a) an unfair procedure is adopted for the buyout, and/or b) unfair prices are offered for the buyout. If instead both prongs of the transaction are demonstrably fair, meaning the majority confirms to the fiduciary duty owed to the minority holders, the decision to undergo a freezeout merger may often be in the company’s best interests. \n\nThere is a necessary, constant tension between the rights of the minority shareholders and that of the flexibility of a company. The latter is mostly modulated by the decision-making prowess of the majority, and as such, it is indeed possible that in certain cases minority freezeouts might be adequately justified.\n\nConsider the previous example of the impending transaction and the (apparently) covert freezeout merger. It might so happen that securing the minority holders’ consent might push the expenditure associated with the transaction to such an extent that it is rendered unprofitable. Further, in order to avoid a venture that has been thus made unprofitable, the company might reject the transaction, whose value addition to the larger business community might have been enormous. \n\nIn their insightful discussion about the free-rider problem in corporate governance, the authors talk about shareholders who contribute negligibly to the governance of the company that they hold shares in, and instead keep profiting from the company’s transactions. However, when their passivity starts to affect the potential transactions of the company, majority holders are arguably justified in removing them, and thus freezeout mergers effectively solve the free-rider problem. This may lead to more efficient business decisions.\n\nWhile undertaking a freezeout merger in order to go private may not be an exactly financially gainful procedure, going private might reduce much of the regulatory burden that comes with being a publicly-listed company. It also eliminates the expenses associated with proxy reports and other mandated periodic communication with the regulator. As such, freezeout mergers must not be banned outright.\n\nLegislative Scope\n\nThe legislative provisions most closely dealing with freezeout mergers can be found in Sections 235 and 236 of the Companies Act 2013. Though they do not explicitly deal with mergers or others schemes of arrangement, they do set out the procedure by which buyouts are conducted. They are especially relevant for compulsory acquisitions of shares, whereby an offeror company squeezes out the minorities in the second company through an acquisition offer. This being the essential step of a freezeout merger, they can be considered to be the legislative provision on the topic of freezeout mergers. Section 235 clearly stipulates that if the minority shareholders do not agree or give their consent to the transfer or sale of shares within a specified period, their shares are assumed to be cancelled, and they are automatically cashed out. \n\nGiven the scant number of cases on freezeout mergers in India, it is necessary that we find the characteristics of the same in the aggregate of other similar transactions. For instance, in the case of Sandvik Asia, the court acknowledged that schemes of arrangement where the minority shareholder was inequitably squeezed out of the shareholding of the company could be held to account, even though they were not, nominally, in violation of the legal provisions. This is because the scheme of a selective reduction of shares was legislatively permitted, and could be easily passed with the support of a shareholding majority, especially in the concentrated company structures such as those in India. This is fertile ground for litigation alleging minority oppression. \n\nFurther, in AIG (Mauritius) LLC v. Tata Televentures (Holdings) Limited, the court duly recognized the possibility of a controlling majority effecting a removal of the minority interest through the use of the established voting procedure (under Section 395 of the Companies Act 1956). The procedure did not take into account that the offeror of a mode of arrangement, such as a merger or a takeover, might be the one having the controlling interest in the target company, rendering the whole transaction palpably unfair. It is reasonable to believe that the controlling majority might effect a merger and minority ejection, without inviting these strictures through the legal smokescreen of an unrelated company.\n\nThe Burden of Proof\n\nAs discussed before, the main grievance that could fuel litigation in the matter of freezeout mergers is the absence of a fair procedure and/or the absence of a fair buyout price. Foreign courts have developed a variety of tests to verify the same. For the purpose of our discussion, the business judgment test and the entire fairness test are relevant. \n\nThe business judgement test is believed to defer to the majority shareholders and is in spirit with the philosophy of majority rule. It assumes that more often than not, majority holders are likely to make business decisions that are in the best interests of the company, and absent any extremely weighty evidence of unfairness from the petitioners’ side, the rule does not go into the procedural fairness of the freezeout procedure.\n\nThe entire fairness test, on the other hand, puts the burden of proof on the majority holders, who need to demonstrate that fairness and ethical standing were observed in the freezeout procedure. This test has often been accused of being overly subservient to the minority shareholders, due to a perception that it adopts an uncritical stance towards their allegations. This criticism, however, ignores the ground reality that it is much more onerous to demonstrate that fairness of procedure was not followed than that it was.\n\nIn most litigation involving minority oppression, Indian courts have largely sided with the business judgement test, reposing their faith in the wisdom of the majority holders.\n\nIn my opinion, the burden of proof must ideally lie on the majority, or controlling, shareholders. This is because of the following factors.\n\nOvert and inherent coercion\n\nMajority shareholders exercise an extraordinary amount of control over the minority holders, in both overt and inherent ways. More visibly, they engage in share dilution, capital reduction, and share consolidation, which adversely impact minority holders, and are less stringent in their voting requirements. The majority shareholders actions impact minority holders in less obvious ways, too; consider the mandatory share cancellation in the situation of a minority holder refusing to sell their shares in the case of an offer from the majority holders, which leaves the minority holders with no say in the matter. Inherent coercion has sometimes been held to be an antiquated argument, but scholars have suggested that this is a myopic view, with arguments involving inherent coercion still being in the spirit of corporate democracy and the recognition of its many shortfalls.\n\nInformation asymmetry\n\nQuite paradoxically, while one of the purposes of freezeouts is to safeguard confidential and sensitive information from minority holders, the same information asymmetry is also active before the freezeout actually takes place. As discussed before, often the purpose of a freezeout is to prevent the minority holders from receiving a share of the profits from a business transaction. It might so happen that the minority shareholders are prevented from gaining information about such transactions due to the difference in their stake in actual decision-making.\n\nBecause it may essentially be an RPT\n\nFreezeout mergers are arguably a very good example of a related party transaction, as they satisfy some characteristics (as per Section 2(76) of the Companies Act 2013) of a related-party transaction. Basically, the offeror in a freezeout merger is a company controlled by the majority shareholders, although not through direct directorship, but through provision of aid and advice to the company from the majority holders in the target company. The same has been held in Sterling v. Mayflower Hotel Corp., where the offering and target companies are essentially the same controlling shareholders on both sides of the transaction, inviting the scrutiny of the courts and/or the market regulator, as the case may be.\n\nAs such, all the precautions and concerns associated with RPTs must also, ideally, apply to freezeout mergers. \n\nThus, the majority shareholders are in an unfairly advantageous position when compared to the minority holders. The consequence of this is that the minority holders are often unable to give sufficient proof to prove the unfairness of the procedure used in the freezeout. For instance, the minority can potentially show the following evidence to prove the same:\nBad faith\nIll intent on the part of the majority holder, which includes:\nPreventing the minority from benefitting from a windfall gain.\nLocking them out on sensitive information, etc.\nInadequate disclosure of material facts concerning the merger, the buyout prices\n\nThe unfairness of the prices, if applicable, has to be of a higher threshold than would be in the interests of the minority holders, as seen in the Cadbury case.\n\nUnfortunately, the minority is nearly always unable to furnish this proof, due to the following reasons:\nCourts are much more likely to defer to the majority shareholding on matters of intent and judgment, as the majority holders can easily point to various kinds of justifications.\nCertain kinds of evidence, such as previous instances of hostility from the majority shareholders towards the minority shareholders, is difficult to obtain and demonstrate before the court.\nThe minority holder suffers from informational asymmetry and is forced to agree to the various mandates of the majority holding without sufficient evidence to question it.\nAs such, the burden of proof must lie with the majority holders, in order to ensure the fairness of the procedure.\n\nAs regards the fairness of the buyout prices, it is relevant to refer to the reverse book building process, which is adopted in the case of delisting of a company. Through this price discovery method, it ensures a suitably fair price for the shareholders as the shares are removed from the company roster. I submit that this process must also be applied in the case of scrutiny involving freezeout mergers, as it is very sensitive to the actual stakes of the minority shareholders, and duly takes into account the minuscule differences that differentiate a fair price from an unfair one. It also does away with the cautionary note sounded in the Cadbury case, where a merely nominal difference in prices was not considered actionable enough. As such, it could help the court or the regulator arrive at a much fairer buyout price for the shares.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian jurisprudence concerning freezeout mergers is still stuck in the rut of the business judgement test, where it ends up ignoring the interests of the minority shareholders. While the inherent compromise between the majority and the minority holders’ varying interests is acknowledged, it is proposed that a regulatory stance that views the minority interests through the prism of the company’s overall interests would necessitate a shifting of the burden of proof into a more justifiable position. A version of the entire fairness test, as demonstrated, is successful in doing the same and must be looked at as the most feasible solution for the highlighted problem.\nFreeze-OutMergersCorporate GovernanceCompanies Act\nCorporate Law\n372 views\n1 like.

The draft for this structure was released around the same time last year and after much deliberation, Central Government finally notified FEMA (Overseas Investment) Rules 2022 (New Rules). Following that, even the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notified the FEMA (Overseas Investment) Regulations 2022 and the FEMA (Overseas Investment) Directions 2022. All these new laws act in sync to facilitate ease of doing business in India. The changes are multi-dimensional and affect a plethora of areas. Each of the changes is worthy of deep perusal and critical analysis. However, in this article, the focus would be on one such change i.e. round-tripping. The article shall examine the background for such change and the effect of new rules while also commenting upon the gap created. \n\nUnderstanding Round Tripping \n\nComplex business structures are a common phenomenon in the corporate domain. Despite the negative tax evasion attribute that comes with them, these structures are often designed for ease of control, separation of business, or easier legal compliance. However, the first thought for each structure is tax evasion and money laundering. In this light, we have a plethora of laws like transfer pricing requirements, both domestically and internationally to ensure that the structures don’t misuse any loopholes. \n\nSince these structures can manipulate the origin of investment and create fictional characters, it is often avoided by the government. In the same vein, before the new framework, an Indian investor could not indirectly invest in India. In simpler terms, the investor was not allowed to invest in any company incorporated outside India that has invested or would invest in India. This ensured that the company did not re-invest the money by flowing it through foreign companies. This kind of transaction is referred to as round tripping.\n\nBackground\n\nBefore the change, round-tripping was not addressed explicitly under any specific laws. The only piece of guidance that was available was among the FAQs issued by RBI. The FAQ number 64 of the FAQs that were available on RBI’s website provided some clarity over the issue. In the answer to a related query, RBI clarified that an Indian party can’t set up an Indian subsidiary via any foreign wholly-owned subsidiary (WoS) or joint venture (JV) directly or indirectly, whether such foreign WoS or JV was already created or was being established for any such purpose. Only in exceptional cases after prior approval was taken from RBI facilitated through AD banks could such setups be permitted. It was not considered a bona fide activity even as per FEMA. The reason for RBI’s dislike here was simple – tax evasion. In the absence of a clear prohibition, it became a trend to incorporate companies in tax havens like Mauritius and through them route the money back to India. In an attempt to discourage this, the restriction through FAQ was imposed. However, such strict prohibition became a hindrance to investment and global competition and thus a high-level advisory group set up by the Ministry of Finance recommended regulated allowance.\n\nThe problem of government against the round tripping is twin fold. Firstly, such investment comes with suspicion of routing black money, the intent of tax evasion, and frivolous investments. Secondly, such investment can’t be considered an actual foreign investment in the country with no increase in globalization for the country. On the other hand, these structures may be essential for securing global tenders, or the prohibition on the same could unnecessarily restrict investment opportunities abroad or even in India. Investment through these structures could also create more employment opportunities, development opportunities, etc. in India. In light of the strong arguments on both sides, a balanced approach through adaptive and relaxation regulations was required. Some changes were recommended by the high-level group while some were discussed in the draft rules. However, the new framework and related new rules that have now finally been made are somehow away from both. \n\nThe Change\n\nAs per the New Rules, such round-tripping structures are permitted without any specific approval requirements. However, the structure must be limited to two layers as prohibition still applies to structures with more than two layers. For example, an Indian resident A can now invest in a foreign entity B even if such entity B has invested or would invest in India. Rule 19(3) of the New Rules prohibits financial commitment which would result in any such structure that would have more than two layers of the subsidiary. This means that A would not be able to invest in B if B invests in C which would further invest in India thus creating three layers of subsidiaries. This change can be understood along the lines of exemptions of layered structures that are provided to banking companies, insurance companies, etc. via the Companies (Restriction on Number of Layers) Rules 2017. This is now paved the way for re-investment in India and has contributed to enhancing the ease of business. Even though such change is positive and well appreciated, there might be some issues that require a re-consideration. \n\nIssues\n\nLack of clarity \n\nEven though, in general understanding, the two layers are understood as layers both in India and outside but no clarity is provided by the government for the same. In this context, confusion may arise as to whether the layers are to be computed internationally excluding the Indian layers, or in its entirety where Indian layers are to be included. Some informal talks have even suggested that the first foreign entity would be the first layer thereby not including the Indian entity while some legal enthusiasts have interpreted it to include the Indian company. It is asserted that in the light of the intent of the relaxation and ease of doing business, the former interpretation would be suitable. The first investment made outside India should ideally be considered as the first layer of investment.\n\nThe new framework also fails to provide any additional notes that illustrate the intent or interpretation of the laws. This is contrary to the Sodhi Committee’s recommendations and has been brought to light by many law enthusiasts. The recommendation of the Sodhi Committee that all complex rules and regulations should have notes for clarity has not been followed in the new framework. This gap has been criticized across the country identifying the lack of compliance with the recommendations and the creation of confusion in the absence of the same. However, it is asserted that though such a recommendation would be highly beneficial in avoiding diverse interpretations and future litigations, the framework is still new and the authorities would require time to provide clarity on every minute issue. Creating excessive pressure through high criticism thus would not help the cause. Further, only after the implementation of a policy could gaps be seen following which guidance and clarity would be required. Even though ideally some notes of clarity should have been provided, the government should be given enough scope to bring them in the future. \n\nVague implementation \n\nThe rules though have permitted at least two-layered structures but have failed to provide any directions for their implementation. The determination of the layers and rules related to them is still a haze. Even if the government chose to provide an exemption to certain layers and not to others, what is now expected is that the government would come up with implementation guidelines to avoid future litigation. In the absence of implementation guidelines, complex rules can be difficult to interpret. Furthermore, procedural requirements of compliance and reporting still await the word. The scope for start-ups, KYC requirements, and applicability are some of the major areas where clarity must be provided. Such procedural requirements were even suggested by the high-level advisory group which have not seen their space in the new framework but would hopefully be added by the government soon. \n\nLimited scope \n\nIn the absence of clarity over the application, the word 'subsidiary' used in the New Rules is also vague and can lead to multiple interpretations. However, combined with the definition provided in the new framework itself, the scope of round-tripping reduces. The word 'subsidiary' in the framework is interpreted to include even those foreign entities where the 10% test is met. This interpretation, however, is evaluated in a negative light as it restricts investment beyond two layers even if there is no actual control merely based on ownership. The wider definition of 'control' in the new framework substantiates the interpretation that even 10% holding would be equivalent to control and thus would be considered a subsidiary. This would unfortunately limit the scope of investment and ease of business which would be contradictory to the object of the entire new framework. Since the definition of 'subsidiary' varies with the laws and the context, some clarity here as to which definition shall be applied could clear the air on the issue. If the definition as per the Companies Act 2013 or any other similar legislation is made applicable, it would not only serve the purpose but would also help achieve the objective. Any wider definition of the subsidiary would make the new provisions almost ineffective. It would become a relaxation given merely on the paper. \n\nThe two-layer rule \n\nThe government’s plan to provide an absolute restriction beyond two layers seems a bit inefficient. The government has allowed the freedom to invest as long as the structure is within two layers which is in line with the existing corporate laws, is considered bona fide and is often viewed as general industry practice. However, this does not guarantee as to how the objective of regulation shall be accomplished. The regulations aimed at ease of business for which disallowance of such structures is a big obstruction but the fact that these structures are often misused can’t be undermined. In light of this, in the draft rules such structures were made subject to assessment as to whether such structures are made for tax evasion. This provision is missing in the new framework which defeats the entire purpose. Irrespective of layers, the structure can have malicious intent. The possibility of tax evasion certainly increases with the number of layers but just the number of layers can’t be the sole determinant of the same. \n\nThe criteria of assessment as suggested in draft rules should have been added in the new framework without any limit of layers. Every round-tripping investment structure should have been subject to assessment following which investment could have been allowed. It may be said that this would be similar to already existing rules where RBI approval is required. However, for better implementation, a lower/separate authority could have been made responsible for the assessment. Furthermore, The factors based on which such an assessment was required to be made, the disclosures required, etc. could have been specified for more effectiveness. Such factors for determination of the authenticity of structure could have been included nevertheless in the new framework as lack of transparency plays a major role in tax evasion but they are still missing. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe new framework was indeed much required in the domain of overseas investment. However, the interpretation of the same has proven to become a task for all. Every discussion brings forth new challenges for the framework and identifies new gaps. However, such discussions are the necessary evil to create a good regulatory environment in India. In the same spirit, this article tries to highlight a few issues in the new framework especially related to round-tripping. Even though round-tripping is deeply connected to tax evasion and money laundering due to its complex structure, a blanket ban can’t be imposed on the same. \n\nRBI understood this concern and thus brought new changes. The changes have managed to give some relief by allowing two layers for re-investment, but some clarity is lacking. If the government provides clarity as to how would the layers be determined and what would be considered subsidiary implementation could be better. However, on a different line, it is asserted that disclosures could have been required along with some KYC requirements. Further, instead of restriction on layers, restriction in form of permission could have been imposed for meeting the actual objective. Despite this being missing, the new framework could be effective if implemented properly.\nOverseas InvestmentFEMARBIRound Tripping\nCorporate Law\n508 views\n3 likes. Post not marked as liked\n3"

        "content": "Aditi Kundu\nJun 8\n8 min read\nPrinciple of Commercial Wisdom Revisited: Comment on MK Rajagopalan v. Dr Periasamy Palai Gounder\n[Aditi is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nThe principle of commercial wisdom of the committee of creditors (CoC) has been hit hard by the Supreme Court (SC) in the very recent judgement of MK Rajagopalan v. Dr Periasamy Palai Gounder and Another (the present judgement). The court observed that if the decision of the CoC is in contravention of any law in force, the principle of commercial wisdom cannot be taken as a defense to go forward with the impugned decision, and the same becomes subjected to judicial scrutiny. \n\nIn light of the present judgement, the author attempts to analyze the stage that the principle of commercial wisdom of the CoC holds under the Indian insolvency jurisprudence, its functioning in the current regime, and what holds for the future.  \n\nAbout the Case\n\nFacts\n\nAppu Hotels Limited (Corporate Debtor) was successfully admitted to corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). Among the various resolution plans submitted, MK Rajagopalan’s was accepted by the CoC and it acted as the successful resolution applicant. The resolution plan was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which was challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). NCLAT rejected the resolution plan on various grounds of material procedural irregularity and also declared the resolution applicant to be ineligible in terms of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882 and Section 29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) read with Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act 2013 (2013 Act). The resolution applicant appealed to the SC against the NCLAT’s order.\n\nIssue\n\nThe relevant issues were (a) whether the resolution applicant was ineligible, and (b) whether the resolution plan so approved by the CoC and the NCLT had the sound authority of commercial wisdom of the CoC?\n\nRuling\n\nThe resolution applicant was held ineligible as it acted as an alter ego of a trust named Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth (Trust). The Trust had also submitted a resolution plan, however, the same was rejected on the ground that it is a charitable trust being hit by Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882. MK Rajagopalan, being the Managing Director of the Trust, relied on the Trust for its credentials, hence he was more or less acting on behalf of the Trust itself. \n\nFurther on, MK Rajagopalan was, at the same time, also acting as Managing Director of a healthcare company, and the expansion motives of the company brought MK Rajagopalan into conflict of interest with the Corporate Debtor. Therefore, this resulted in his ineligibility to act as a resolution applicant under Section 29A of IBC due to the criterion mentioned in Section 166(4) of the 2013 Act. \n\nSection 30 read with Section 31 of IBC requires that the final resolution plan be approved by the CoC before it is furnished for approval of the Adjudication Authority. In this case, the resolution applicant was directed by the CoC to revise the resolution plan. However, the revised plan was directly presented to NCLT for its approval. The resolution applicant contended post-facto approval of the CoC, which was rejected by the court. The court viewed such a procedural irregularity to be affecting the commercial wisdom of the CoC. It observed that the commercial wisdom of the CoC is to be founded on thorough examination and assessment of all the circumstances surrounding the subject matter. \n\nPrinciple of Commercial Wisdom: Explained \n\nIBC envisages a body of financial creditors of a corporate debtor called CoC, which plays a fundamental role in in determining the adoption of a resolution plan. A resolution plan is adopted successfully by receiving at least 66% of the total voting share of the creditors. \n\nCoC’s decision is considered a commercial decision, hence it is considered appropriate that for a defaulting corporation, its creditors should make the final call. Commercial wisdom of the creditors lies in the assumption that creditors are well-informed about the corporate debtor, therefore being the best evaluators of a resolution plan. This makes them well-equipped to make a collective business decision that is based on analytical assessment and thorough examination of all the qualitative and quantitative circumstances. \n\nCalling IBC a beneficial economic legislation, the judiciary has taken a hands-up approach toward the commercial wisdom of CoC. In K Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank, SC took note of the primacy of commercial wisdom of the CoC stating that the legislature has not given the tribunals or the courts the jurisdiction to scrutinize CoC’s commercial decision. The courts cannot intervene in the justness or fairness of the decision by the CoC; it is final and non-justiciable. In Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel v. Satish Kumar Gupta, SC held that the final decision is left with the CoC which evaluates the feasibility and viability of the resolution plan and considers all aspects of the plan and the consequences that would follow; making such a decision requires an utmost degree of commercial wisdom, hence it should not be questioned by the Adjudicating Authority. The courts have expanded the principle to the extent whereby it refrains from intervening even in cases where the resolution plan is submitted by the resolution applicant beyond the time limit prescribed in IBC. Kalpraj Dharmashi and Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited are prime instances of such a non-interventionist approach of the judiciary. \n\nConsequences of Primacy of Commercial Wisdom of the Creditors\n\nCourts have made commercial wisdom a set-in-stone principle of the IBC. However, in recent years, the same has had its ramifications. \n\nHuge haircuts\n\nHaircuts are defined as the difference between what is claimed and what is actually received. In recent years, there have been instances where lenders have conceded to massive haircuts. Although haircuts are a part and parcel of CIRP, the high degree and increased frequency of such haircuts is problematic. With every financial year, the recovery rate has been showing a downtrend. Banks have been able to recover only 30% of their value, wherein they have been accepting INR 69 for every INR 100 of admitted claims. One of the recent instances is of Videocon Industries Limited case, whose creditors took a haircut of as high as 99.28% on their loans, receiving almost nothing. The same was also condemned by the court, but the decision could not be overridden due to commercial wisdom. Such practices have been damaging to the creditors and reveal much about the way commercial wisdom is being exercised. \n\nInefficiency in CIRP \n\nOne of the key objectives of the code is the insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor in a time-bound manner. The report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee noted that “speed is the essence” of insolvency law, particularly for two reasons: (a) when there is no clarity as to the ownership and control of the company, major decisions cannot be taken; (b) with time, the assets depreciate further lowering the liquidation value. Unfortunately, the IBC is unable to fulfil its objective in the true spirit, and the Standing Committee Report has also highlighted such delays in CIRP with 71% of cases pending resolution for more than 180 days. Some of the major causes of inefficiency in decision making by CoC are the non-exclusion of financial creditors in the CoC, promoters indirectly gaining control of the CoC in certain cases, and members of the CoC sending their representatives who are not adequately informed about their role nor have the intellectual empowerment to take decisions, resulting in delays in decision making. \n\nAbandonment of labour welfare\n\nIn the Swiss Ribbons case, SC observed that the ultimate goal is to maximize the interest of all the stakeholders. ‘Stakeholders’ effectively includes workers of the corporate debtor. Although IBC caters to the claims of the workers, its implementation is in the hands of the creditors, and their commercial wisdom might not necessarily meet the interests of the employees. In Jet Airways insolvency, the approved resolution plan provided for INR 52 crores for the workers as against the claim of INR 715 crores. Workers do not have a seat at the CoC, and the situation is made worse by subjecting their fate to the commercial wisdom of the lenders. \n\nSignificance of the Judgement \n\nIn the previous cases, the judiciary has supported commercial wisdom holding it as a matter of preeminence and refusing to interfere. However, in the present judgement, the apex court has accepted the primacy of commercial wisdom of CoC but made a bold step in observing that commercial wisdom is a “considered decision which is to be taken with reference to the commercial interests, keeping in the centre the goal of revival of the corporate debtor and maximization of value of assets. It is not just a matter of rhetoric, rather a well-considered decision of the CoC”. This opens the door to the perspective that only because a decision is taken by the CoC, it cannot be presumed to be warranted by a wise commercial judgement that is based on a thorough examination. Rather, it should be actually based on all the relevant information and duly deliberated in the interest of the corporate debtor, and the judiciary or the adjudicating authority has to ensure the same. \n\nGlobal Practice\n\nIn the UK, the central role is played by the administrator who has a wide range of powers to re-organize the company and its assets and has the duty to take into account the interest of the creditors and the corporate debtor and exercise rational business judgement. It was held in Re Charnley Davis Ltd that the administrator is not required to have the highest form of meticulous standards, but what is expected of him is the exercise of reasonable skill, care, and judgement as an insolvency professional of ordinary prudence. The insolvency law in the UK permits the court to interfere with the commercial decision if it causes unfair harm to the creditors or the property of the company is misapplied. Hence, even though the judicial intervention is limited, there exist certain guiding factors for the judiciary when it can intervene and evaluate the commercial wisdom of the creditors. \n\nIn Singapore, the company goes into the hands of a judicial manager who is a certified insolvency practitioner responsible for managing the company’s affairs and stands in a fiduciary relation to the company and its creditors. He / she / they are required to exercise commercial judgement and the same is ordinarily respected by the courts. Of course, certain circumstances exist when the courts can examine the judicial manager’s conduct, i.e., unfair prejudice or perverse to the interests of the company and its assets or a wrongful exercise of commercial judgement.\n Globally, commercial wisdom has been kept on a high pedestal, and mostly, the creditors are considered as a judicious body evaluating the future of corporate debtors. However, their decisions are often subjected to limited judicial scrutiny if they are grossly unfair or misfeasant to the corporate debtor, its assets, or stakeholders. \n\nWay Ahead\n\nThe problem of unfettered discretionary power to CoC has been previously recognized by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), pursuant to which it released a discussion paper on Code of Conduct for CoC, but the same has not been given effect in law and has also been marred by criticisms. However, with the present judgement, hope exists for a more evaluative interpretation of the commercial wisdom of the CoC by the judiciary. In this respect, the author suggests that by taking lessons from the UK and Singapore, the Indian legislature can evolve certain factors such as unfair prejudice to creditors, misfeasance, or illogical considerations, and it may incorporate the same in the IBC. Only when a commercial decision of the CoC is blemished by the above-mentioned factors can the judiciary intervene to ensure a balance between commercial wisdom and interests of the corporate debtor and its assets. \n\nTo tackle the problem of haircuts, IBBI can prescribe a permissible limit of haircuts, and if the haircut goes beyond the limit, the same must be subject to scrutiny by the Adjudicating Authority. Due to the gap in commercial knowledge, a major obstacle is that the stakeholders are many a time unable to understand commercial judgement, even when it is valid. A plausible solution can be the creation of a communication channel between the CoC and the other stakeholders, whereby the latter can raise their objections or clarifications. This will help the stakeholders to understand the rationale behind the proposed resolution plan. Additionally, it will also reduce the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. This might raise the question of delay in the CIRP, but the communication channel can run in parallel with the other stages of CIRP.\nInsolvencyIBCCommercial Wisdom\nInsolvency Law\n466 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Unconditional Stay: Legislative Caution Meets Judicial Redundancy",
        "content": "Lavanya Pathak, Pallavi Mishra\nJun 4\n7 min read\nUnconditional Stay: Legislative Caution Meets Judicial Redundancy\n[Lavanya and Pallavi are advocates practicing in the Delhi High Court.]\n\nIn a bid to make India an attractive hub for arbitration and promoting the benefits of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, the legislature and judiciary have always struggled to strike a balance between the speedy disposal of cases and the necessity for judicial review, where warranted. Another attempt at reconciling these seemingly contrasting policy considerations was made by the Arbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act 2021 (Amendment Act).\n\nVide gazette dated 11 May 2021, the legislature retrospectively made amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act) inter alia revising the scope of Section 36 which lays down the provision for ‘enforcement’ of arbitral awards. The present article pertains specifically to the introduction of second proviso to Section 36(3) which mandates the court to grant an ‘unconditional stay’ if it is satisfied that a prima facie case exists to demonstrate that the award was induced or effected by fraud or corruption. In analyzing the scope and application of the provision, the article delves into examining: (i) whether judicial practice has in fact defeated the legislative intent by imposing a high standard in granting a stay than contemplated by the words of the provision, and (ii) whether differing standards of proof of fraud exist under Section 36(3) vis-à-vis Section 34 of the Act.\n\nProvision relating to Unconditional Stay on Arbitral Award\n\nVide Section 2 of the Amendment Act, an additional proviso was inserted to Section 36(3), with retrospective effect from 23 October 2015, allowing the court to grant an unconditional stay on the enforcement of an award, pending disposal of a challenge under Section 34 of the Act. However, this stay is limited to cases where it is prima facie apparent that the arbitration agreement or contract which forms the basis of the award was induced or effected by ‘fraud’ or ‘corruption’. The explanation to the provision further elaborates its application by clarifying that the same shall apply to all cases arising out of or in relation to arbitral proceedings regardless of whether they were commenced prior to or after the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act 2015 (2015 Amendment Act).\n\nWhile the legislature seems to have cogent reasons for this enactment, the amendment has met with considerable resistance and criticisms by academicians and legal commentators alike.\n\nJudicial Considerations\n\nThe original legal position i.e., that the mere filing of an application under Section 34 shall render the award unenforceable until the appeal petition is disposed of, made the arbitration system  significantly weak for protecting legitimate business interests of the award holder. This is because the awards were routinely challenged in many cases, merely for getting a stay on any payment under the award. This was exacerbated by the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of National Aluminium Company Limited v. Presstel and Fabrictions Private Limited, which held that the award shall only be enforceable as a decree on the expiry of the time for making an application under Section 34. In effect, this meant that the mere admission of a petition under Section 34 would have a chilling effect on award creditor’s right to derive the benefit accrued by the award. \n\nHowever, this problem was appropriately remedied by the 2015 Amendment Act whereby instead of an “automatic stay”, the parties were eligible for a stay on a separate application, subject to the discretion of the court on such conditions, as may be prescribed. In context of this, many argue that the 2021 amendment to the provision was actually unwarranted.\n\nTwo issues arise with the present amendment which has introduced a second proviso to Section 36(3). Firstly, the nature of the stay prescribed is both unconditional and non-discretionary as the court 'shall stay' upon prima facie satisfaction of the existence of fraud. This means that while the grant for stay may depend upon a finding of fraud, but if found, the exercise of power to stay the enforcement of award becomes mandatory. The exercise of discretion requires a consideration of the merits of the challenge and therefore a review of the award. Secondly, a literal interpretation of the proviso shows that it extends both, to a fraudulent or corrupt arbitration agreement and contract. This seems to be a threshold far excess, considering that it is a settled position of law that an arbitration agreement is independent and severable from the contract. The legislative rationale however remains that such a provision is necessary to ensure that the country does not become a “center of procuring award through corrupt and fraud means”.\n\nAnalysis\n\nGiven the legislative and judicial developments underlying the object of the arbitral process, it is now a settled point that the grounds for interference with an award is restricted under Section 34 of the Act. However, it is the authors’ view that such narrow scope vis-à-vis second proviso to Section 36(3) should not paralyze the parties from seeking a stay by virtue of imposition of judicial standards so high, that it virtually becomes impossible a burden of proof to discharge. \n\nConsidering that this is a recent amendment, there are still insufficient number of precedents to gauge the underlying principles guiding the courts to exercise discretion under the second proviso to Section 36(3). However, the courts as of now seem to be taking a cautious approach by allowing very limited cases to take the benefit of this provision by setting a high standard of such prima facie examination of fraud or corruption. \n\nIn Damodar Valley Corporation v. Reliance Infrastructure, the Calcutta High Court dismissed an application for unconditional stay stating that the petition was unable to make an “exceptional case for unconditional stay of the award” since there was nothing that shocked the court’s “conscience” or indicated that the award was without jurisdiction or obtained by fraud or corruption.\n\nSimilarly, the Bombay High Court in State of Maharashtra v. Jaykumar Fulchand Ajmera set a high standard of prima facie proof by interpreting the word “induced” to necessarily be based on some fraud practice or corruption and stating that a mere allegation of inducement is not sufficient. The court has further considered whether the ground of fraud or corruption was taken by the applicant while challenging the award under Section 34.\n\nWhile dismissing applications for unconditional stay in case of Percept Talent Management v. Sourav Chandidas Ganguly, the Calcutta High Court has further elaborated on this proviso holding that by reading the second proviso in light of the first, the judgment-debtor cannot seek a stay as a matter of right without conditions imposed by the court like that of furnishing of security for the stay of award. Furthermore, in Fair Deal Supplies Limited. v. R Piyarelal Iron and Steel, the court again rejected the grant of unconditional stay, and reiterated that the 2015 Amendment Act purported to cure the mischief of automatic stay due to which “award holders would have to wait for umpteen years to get there just dues”.\n\nIn Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited v. Canara Bank and Another, while adjudicating upon a question concerning allegations of inducement in the contract, the Supreme Court negated the argument of the petitioner stating that it “has not been able to demonstrate prima facie that the contract which is the basis of the award, was induced by fraud or corruption.” However, following the trend in the above judicial precedents, no guidelines as to the examination of a prima facie case of fraud were laid down. \n\nParallel to the allegation and establishment of fraud or corruption under the second proviso to Section 36(3) of the Act, fraud constitutes a ground for setting aside of an award under Section 34. In a catena of decisions with Venture Global Engineering v. Tech Mahindra Limited and Another being a prominent one, the Supreme Court has accepted that “it is not easy to give a definition of what constitutes fraud” as understood by civil courts of justice and in essence includes all acts, omissions and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence. Hence, the ambit of the word ‘fraud’ is itself wide and leads to the inference that the proviso to Section 36(3) rather invites the court to liberally interpret the provision as was intended by the legislature by virtue of the words ‘prima facie.’ It is hence a matter of discussion whether an excessive judicial standard defeats the legislative intent with which the second proviso was added to Section 36(3) of the Act. \n\nWhile it remains to be seen how the Supreme Court interprets this new provision and how it affects the extensiveness of its applicability, the High Courts seem to be making very cautious approach to ensure that the proviso is not used to turn back to the original position before the 2015 amendment and to keep the judicial intervention to a minimum. Such an approach is undeniably sensible as the consideration to keep alternative dispute resolution unaffected by the delay and laches in court, must be paramount. However, a balance needs to be drawn to intersect the legislative intent and judicial approach. The discretion under second proviso to Section 36(3) should not be posed as an unattainable standard for a party. A rigorously cautious view while granting a stay on grounds of fraud and corruption cannot operate to defeat the relief contemplated by the provision leading to denial of interests of justice. It is also pertinent to note that the conclusive determination of whether an award is to be set aside on grounds of fraud or corruption is to be decided on merits by the court while adjudicating upon a petition under Section 34. In parallel, it is only natural for a party to seek a stay on the enforcement of an award when alleging that the award is liable to be set aside on grounds of fraud within the scope of Section 34. In context of this, it is evident that akin to Section 34, under Section 36(3), the court is required to assess the award on merits before granting a stay while the petitioner pursues its challenge under Section 34. In authors’ view, such standard under second proviso to Section 36(3) should be balanced as the legislative mandate is only to make out a ‘prima facie’ case, and not to establish a conclusive case of fraud, as such interpretation would render the intent behind the clause otiose. \n\nConsidering the interplay which exists between these two sections, it is rather obvious that the ‘prima facie’ standard under Section 36(3) should be less stringently interpreted than what is contemplated under Section 34. Though no test can ever conclusively lay what constitutes a 'prima facie' test of fraud/corruption, it is important that the Supreme Court advances a principled interpretation of second proviso to Section 36(3) premised on some guidelines keeping in view the scope of Section 34.\nArbitration and ConciliationSection 34Section 362015 Amendment\nDispute Resolution\n241 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "content": "Aditya Singh\nMay 30\n6 min read\nM/s Oasis Projects v/s NHIDCL: Continuing the Pre-Arbitral Conundrum\n[Aditya is a student at National Law School of India University, Bengaluru.]\n\nThe February 2023 ruling of the Delhi High Court in M/S Oasis Projects v. MD, National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation caught the news for its ruling that a contractually mandated pre-arbitral stage (conciliation in the instant case) is not mandatory. The brief facts of the case were that the petitioner was seeking appointment of an arbitrator u/s 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act) to settle a dispute pertaining to ‘balance work for four-lanning of NH 39’. The dispute resolution clause in the contract was multi-tiered and stipulated conciliation as the precursor to arbitration. What is also of the importance is that the dispute resolution clause was laid out in detail with stipulated timelines for initiation and completion of the process, mode of nominating the panel, etc. \n\nAt present, the  Indian jurisprudence is still grappling with whether such multi tiered clauses are mandatory or directory and is yet to arrive at a consistent and workable test to gauge the same. The courts have continued to import extraneous considerations such as expediency, probability of the pre-arbitral mechanism’s success, external overarching principles, etc. To elucidate upon the state of affairs, this article critiques the court’s reasoning in the instant case by elucidating upon the overarching principles of multilateral dispute resolution clauses. It then examines the inconsistencies and uncertainties prevailing in the Indian jurisprudence. The article also puts forth certain recommendations which may help in achieving consistency.\n\nCritiquing the Court's Approach\n\nBefore delving into specific analysis, it is imperative to explore the broad underlying principle behind multilateral dispute resolution clauses. As was observed in the Centrotrade line of cases, Tarun Chatterjee, J’s verdict from the 2006 division bench giving primacy to party autonomy became the majority opinion of the 2017 full bench, the rationale being a fundamental one that parties to an arbitration have the right to decide the applicable substantive law, procedure, seat, venue, etc. Hence, the court observed that when parties are operating in a framework which provides self-determining authority of this extent, party autonomy is of paramount importance and the guiding principle in adjudication. The Supreme Court in other cases such as Central Bank of India Limited v. Hartford Fire Insurance has stated that where the language of the contract is clear, effect has to be given to the bargain of the parties and the plain letter of the contract. In the Centrotrade line of cases, the pivotal area that created room for contention was the public policy challenge to the clause allowing parties to appeal the award to a larger tribunal. However, in usual cases of multilateral dispute resolution clauses, the conditions stipulate mandatory negotiation, conciliation or mediation hence completely removing the apprehension of public policy violation. As will be elaborated upon later, even the other countries use this test of construing a condition precedent clause as mandatory if the same is clear. \n\nIn the instant case, the court ended up appointing the arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act, but the same is subject to Section 11(6) of the Act. The authority to appoint the arbitrators stems from a valid ‘arbitration agreement’ per Section 7. Further, fulfilment of the pre-arbitral procedures may have formed a basis for having consented to arbitration in the first place. Hence, precedence here should be given to the bargain of the parties. Thus, the above principles derived from the various case law seem to be at odds with the Delhi HC’s rationale [paragraph 12] that “conciliation expresses a broad notion of a voluntary process, controlled by the parties and conducted with the assistance of a neutral third person or persons. It can be terminated by the parties at any time as per their free will. Therefore, while interpreting Article 26.2, the basic concept of Conciliation would have to be kept in mind.” \n\nJustifying the above rationale, the court [paragraphs 13 and 14] stated that the voluntariness was inherent in the process as the office memorandum mandated the consent of the other party in order to refer the dispute to conciliation. However, the office memorandum did not take into consideration the different stages of conciliation that were contemplated in the dispute resolution clause in the contract. The dispute resolution clause in several instances states that the parties have agreed to explore conciliation before resorting to arbitration hence making their intent clear. \n\nExamining the Indian Jurisprudence\n\nAmong the case laws (such as Iron and Steel Company v. M/s Tiwari Road Lines, Sushil Kumar Bhardwaj v. Union of India (Sushil Kumar Bhardwaj), etc.) that have construed pre-arbitration requirements as mandatory, there is consensus that fulfilment of pre-arbitral procedure forms a basis for consent to arbitrate. These cases have also placed reliance on Section 11(6) and the overall legislative scheme of Section 11 which makes the same abundantly clear. The legislative intent becomes starker with the increased shift towards party autonomy in the Act. The Supreme Court in Sushil Kumar Bhardwaj noted this through the difference in Section 20 of the Arbitration Act 1940 and Section 11 of the Act. The former plainly provisioned for parties to petition the court for a court-appointed arbitrator in case the parties fail to appoint one directly. \n\nThe other line of cases which construe pre-arbitral procedure as merely directory differ in their reasoning. For instance, the court in Demerara Distillers simply stated that non-compliance with the stipulated requirements “does not merit serious consideration” as the same in the court’s assessment would be an “empty formality”. This reasoning apart from being vague is also over-intrusive and resembles a parens patriae attitude by the courts. The approach of dictating the best path for the parties as opposed to upholding the statutory mandate coupled with the letter of the contract is baseless and hence creates enormous room for uncertainty. Other facets of this rationale include extensions such as conciliation/ mediation only being effective when they are truly voluntary. A similar rationale was also used in the instant case. \n\nThe second broad line of reasoning as taken in Ravinder Kumar Verma v. BPTP (Ravinder Kumar) and reproduced in other cases was that construing pre-arbitral requirements as mandatory would prejudice the parties' interests as the time consumed is not excluded from limitation. However, the Supreme Court in Shree Ram Mills Limited v. Utility Premises and Geo Miller & Co has ruled that the cause of action i.e., right to reference only accrues when the pre-arbitral procedures have failed. Pre-arbitral procedures can be shielded by Section 5 of the Limitation Act 1963 as the same is a “sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period”. There is sufficient statutory basis and jurisprudence preceding Ravinder Kumar that ensures the rights of the parties from being prejudiced. Another inconsistency in Ravinder Kumar is that it relies on Saraswati Construction v. Co-operative Group Housing (Saraswati Construction) to conclude that pre-arbitral procedures are directory. This is because Saraswati Construction predates the Act and the scheme of Section 20, Arbitration Act 1940 was different from the scheme under Section 11 of the Act as has been stated earlier.\n\nIn pre-arbitral requirements specific to conciliation, courts without proper assessment have also used Section 77 of the Act which allows parties to initiate arbitral/ judicial proceedings if it is necessary to preserve their rights. However, this does not count as a line of reasoning that construes pre-arbitral procedures as merely directory.\n\nRecommendations and Way Forward\n\nThus far, it can be noted that the Indian jurisprudence lacks a coherent test to determine whether a pre-arbitral clause is mandatory or directory. Since they, after all, are contractual conditions agreed upon by the parties, a plausible approach would be to enforce these clauses per the wordings as long as they are clear. This approach of not making any additional imputations when the clause is unambiguous and is an established one in contract construction as mentioned above. Other jurisdictions such as the UK and Australia also follow this approach in cases of multilateral dispute resolution contracts. The author agrees with the ruling in the English case of Wah v. Grant Thornton, that a vague and general agreement to negotiate in good faith would not be enforceable. However, as long as a multilateral dispute resolution clause contains aspects such as the number of days, method of exhausting the clause, a specific mode of dispute resolution, etc., multiple jurisdictions have construed it to be mandatory in such cases. As even Gary Born and Marija Šćekić have concluded, such clauses are in most circumstances unenforceable on ‘grounds of uncertainty’. In cases such as the instant case wherein the clause contains all the necessary steps of compliance, there is no reason not to construe the impugned clauses as mandatory.\n\nThe Indian jurisprudence needs to move beyond this conundrum and answer whether non-compliance with an unambiguous pre-arbitral condition amounts to an issue of jurisdiction or admissibility. This is because the same has important implications ranging from dismissal of claims by the tribunal, order to comply to the annulment of the award at an enforcement stage. The adoption of non-arbitral methods is an effective tool to preserve business relations. The author concludes that pre-arbitral requirements should be mandatory as long as the clause is clear. Maintaining consistency at this stage, the jurisprudence should steer towards determining the consequences of non-compliance.\n\n\nPre-ArbitralArbitration and ConciliationOasis Projects\nDispute Resolution\n326 views\n9 likes.

        "title": "Addressing The Conundrum Of Angel Tax Amendment Circumventing The Start-Up Regime",
        "content": "Ishita Khandelwal, Janhavi Mahalik\nMay 30\n5 min read\nAddressing The Conundrum Of Angel Tax Amendment Circumventing The Start-Up Regime\n[Ishita and Janhavi are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nIn recent years, India's start-up culture has assumed a greater significant trajectory as it has made a substantial contribution to the economic expansion and development of the nation. With approximately 27,000 startups, 25 unicorns (valued at over US$1.2 billion), and US$38 billion in consolidated investments over 2016-2020, India is credited to harbour the largest start-up ecosystem in the world. The reason behind such a wide expansion can be contributed to various factors such as skilled workforce, infrastructure, private investment (seed, angel, venture capital, private equity), access to funding, innovation ecosystem, venture capital, regulatory policies etc. Irrespective of such advancements, there are still many obstacles for Indian startups to overcome, including the unorganised and splintered nature of the consumer base, the absence of flexible and transparent regulatory framework and policy decisions, the poor infrastructure, and the inability to ingress the governmental incentives (such as tax breaks and the difficulties in conducting business).\n\nOne of the recent hurdles on the pavement of start-up companies is the expansion of the ambit of angel tax to include non-resident investors under Budget 2023. Angel tax is frequently seen as the devil in the start-up environment, despite how majestic and virtue-filled the word \"angel\" appears. Under Section 56 (2)(viib) of the Income-tax Act 1961, the government first implemented an angel tax in 2012. It is levied on the extra monetary gains obtained by any private company when it sells shares at a price premium to the fair market value. Prior to 2023, foreign resident investors and venture capital funds were exempted from Angle tax. But in order to maintain a parity in taxation, the Finance Bill 2023 has done away with the criterion of residency, thus making the section applicable to foreign investors. This recent tax amendment will act as a double whammy for the start-up companies that are already under the “funding winter.”\n\nForeign Investors as a Boon to the Start-Ups\n\nIndian start-up companies depend mostly on foreign investment or overseas sources for their growth. Data shows that in the recent years these companies have generated a bulk of capital, where the private equity and venture capital summed up to a total of $54 billion. It should not go unnoticed that global investors like Japan's SoftBank and the US-based Tiger Global have helped a number of startups develop their operations and reach about a billion-dollar valuation. An amendment of this stature is capable of shaking the early growth of the start-up companies from its core. It will discourage international investors from making investments in India as they may not want to cope with higher tax liabilities. This would prompt the start-ups to anticipate the reorganising of their assets and relocate overseas to escape pressure from the foreign investors. Some scholars have also remarked that this amendment is counter-intuitive to reverse-flipping as this will, in itself, accelerate flipping overseas.\n\nImpact on Issuance of Shares\n\nAnother major impediment with the latest amendment is the \"deemed income provision\" of the  Income-tax Act 1961 that applies to specific types of property, including securities like stocks. It states that if such property is purchased for less than its fair market value (FMV), the difference between the FMV and the actual amount paid is treated as income and subject to taxation as such. According to the tax authorities, this clause also applies to shares bought through a primary offering. The share issue price must adhere to both provisions if the proposed adjustment to the angel tax provision is passed; otherwise, there may be negative tax repercussions for either the privately held company (PLC) issuing the shares or the investors subscribing to them. Shares issued to non-resident investors must also abide by the valuation standards set forth by rules governing foreign exchange management (FEMA), even if identical considerations would also apply to capital raised from non-resident investors. If adopted, the proposed modification could contradict in lines with the FEMA regulations' valuation standards and limit PLCs' ability to raise money from non-resident investors. Although the valuation guidelines provided by each provision differ, there is still some room for a tax-compliant share issuance that does not have negative effects on the PLC or the investors. However, if the suggested modification is passed, shares issued to non-resident investors would also be subject to the same tax law considerations. According to FEMA regulations, shares offered to non-residents must be issued on at least an FMV basis. The PLC will be ostensibly required to issue shares at exactly the FMV to ensure that there are no penalties under either clause, which is exceedingly restrictive and may not be commercially plausible. This clashes with the valuation ceiling specified under the angel tax provision.\n\nConversion of Convertible Instruments: The Aftermath\n\nAiming to convert the convertible securities, like preference shares or debentures, into equity shares may become more difficult as a result of the proposed modification to the Income-tax Act 1961. The conflicting decisions of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) have raised questions regarding whether the angel tax provision applies to these conversion transactions. According to one of the rulings of the ITAT, it is considered that the angel tax provision is applicable to conversion transactions if all of the prerequisites are met, and the consideration received by the issuer-company can take many different forms, such as the cancellation of debt obligations, the release of asset liens, or an improvement in the debt-to-equity ratio. The ITAT has, however, also ruled that in order for the provision to be applicable, shares must be issued and payment must be made in the same calendar year. If the proposed amendment is passed, it is anticipated that these disagreements are prone to occur more frequently in the future course and that there may be valuation-related problems between the FEMA regulations and the angel tax provision.\n\nCritical Analysis and Conclusion \n\nIt is hoped that the recent amendment with respect to angel tax is given another perspective in light of the various challenges mentioned above. The measure is likely to affect foreign direct investment in India, which is evidently not within the ambit of India’s affordability at the present instance. To evade such obstacles, the companies might attempt to hasten any present fundraising from foreign investors before the due date or the investors could also consider registering and operating through AIFs. Taking this into consideration, either the withdrawal of the said amendment or the inclusion of certain exemptions under the section could be a desirable alternative. For example, non-resident entities registered with the Reserve Bank of India, the Security and Exchange Board of India or similar regulatory authorities in their respective countries could be exempted. Similarly, Category I foreign portfolio investors under the SEBI Foreign Portfolio Investment Regulations 2019, and direct/indirect investments by sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, could also be given an exemption. Additionally, when shares are issued at a greater price than the valuation report by a Category I merchant banker, a safe harbour mechanism / tolerance limit of up to 25% may be granted. Any value disagreements that exceed the tolerance level of 25% should be forwarded to an approval panel for a fair examination. \nAngel TaxStart-upsIncome-Tax Act\nTaxation Law\n42 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Algorithmic Collusion in an Oligopolistic Market: Difficulty in Gauging Conscious Price Parallelism",
        "content": "Yash Arjariya\nMay 27\n6 min read\nAlgorithmic Collusion in an Oligopolistic Market: Difficulty in Gauging Conscious Price Parallelism\n[Yash is a student at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur.]\n\nAn oligopolistic market structure is characterized by significantly fewer competing entities, homogenous products, and inelastic demand. Price parallelism and supra-competitive prices are, according to European and American jurisprudence, only natural outcomes of such market structures and thus not illegal per se. The jurisdictions take into account plus factors like communications and information exchanges to gauge whether such price parallelism is conscious price parallelism or not. \n\nAccording to a European Union (EU) industry study performed in 2017, a significant majority of online merchants use pricing software for their enterprises. The use of an algorithm for automated pricing changes is a necessary activity for major merchants with a variety of several thousand distinct items. In the United States (US), David Topkins and Trod cases revealed examples of algorithmic collusion in which price-fixing algorithms were used to keep prices artificially high and collude with a rival company. This is critical when organisations employ the same pricing software even without knowing about it, leading to a scenario where both algorithms fix prices in the same direction. As a consequence, the price of two firms might – absolutely inadvertently – seem to be anticompetitive. Similar was the situation with the book The Making of a Fly, where the interplay of both sellers’ algorithms caused constant positive feedback, resulting in a price spiral.\n\nTherefore, algorithmic collusion pertains to the concept that pricing algorithms might autonomously realise tacit collusion. By virtue of coordinating their price fixing through such algorithms, businesses may collectively maximize their earnings without an express agreement to do so. The article analyses the problem before the antitrust regulators in establishing guilt in such cases. The article then accounts for the jurisprudence around Competition Commission of India (CCI) in this regard. Finally, the article concludes by outlining the need for pro-active market screening and the adoption of a ‘harm-based’ approach by the regulators. \n\nSubverting the Conventional Conception of Anti-Competitive Agreement\n\nIn algorithmic collusion, competitors may raise their prices as a signal for other competitors to follow, i.e., in algorithmically adjusted pricing, the competing product’s price will automatically be adjusted in response to the price hike. Algorithms re-adjust prices based on a multitude of factors, with the pricing of competing products receiving the most weight. As a result, price adjustments may result in artificially high pricing and price stabilization. \n\nAcross jurisdictions like the EU (Bayer AG v. Commission of the European Communities, paragraph 69), Australia, the USA, etc., establishing collusion necessitates the establishment of intention or concurrence of wills between parties. In conscious parallelism, competitors unilaterally increase prices above the competitive level in reaction to the actions of their rivals, but without “any unlawful arrangement or even any contact or communication among the competitors.” This makes it simpler to produce the same collusive consequences even without explicit agreements or coordinated activities, as the German Monopolkommission mentioned in its report. \n\nThe existing jurisprudence is not readily receptive to this idea and practise of collusion. In Eturas’s case, the Court of Justice of the EU undoubtedly meant to underline that the technology by itself is not capable of breaching competition. Participants must establish a certain level of communication and consent. In this context, TreuhandAG v. European Commission most liberally construed interaction between cartel participants as ‘mutual action,’ if not a firm’s response to an illegal cartel initiative. However, the ruling in Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. v. Commission of the European Communities upheld the competitor’s right to change the pricing based upon taking into account the present or foreseeable conduct of his competitors. This caveat on the application of ‘mutual action’ becomes more glaring in the light of the increased use of self-learning or machine-learning algorithms, by virtue of which coordination can be done with the mere prediction of the other without any need to enter into any agreement to do so. In such cases, a firm can vigorously defend allegations of concerted action by contending that the algorithm used was simply reacting to a price increase on a competing product. As per Ezrachi and Stucke, this raises particular apprehension that competitors may elude detection for their price-fixing carried out through algorithmic collusion. \n\nIndian Jurisprudence\n\nThe CCI’s decision in Samir Agrawal v. CCI (Samir Agrawal) may be considered a missed opportunity for dealing with algorithmic collusion. The regulator established the direct evidence test by stating that collusive behaviour requires a meeting of minds or agreement. This approach of CCI was along similar lines as in Re: Domestic Air Lines, wherein the Director General (DG) concluded parallel behaviour between airlines to increase prices after strikes by Air India employees. However, the CCI did not accept the findings of the DG on account of a lack of material evidence establishing agreement between the parties. \n\nRe: Alleged Cartelization in the Airlines Industry (Airlines Industry) marks a departure from CCI’s existent jurisprudence. CCI developed a two-step test for dealing with algorithmic collusion. Firstly, CCI looked for human communication between entities. The role of algorithms was examined in the second step. The test met its logical end in Shikha Roy v. Jet Airways (Shikha Roy), which also marked the dawn of proactive invigilation against algorithmic collusion in India. Unlike the Airlines Industry case, where CCI looked into alleged algorithmic collusion after DG’s report, in Shikha Roy, CCI ordered DG to look at the role of algorithms during the investigation itself.\n\nThe two cases referred to above point towards standardization of the two-step test, which the CCI may find customary in its application while dealing with cases of algorithmic collusion. However, the CCI’s jurisprudence, though developing, is far from adequate on two grounds. First, when determining algorithmic collusion, the test is more specific in gauging whether the competitors used a common algorithm. The use of different platforms or software by competing firms may preclude an assessment of guilt by the regulator. Secondly, the test is still a hangover of the traditional approach because it necessitates gauging ‘intention.’ As laid out in the Airlines Industry case, the extent of ‘human intervention’ is one of three pivotal factors of Step 2 of the test while determining guilt. The author submits that cartels may arise in marketplaces where computers arrange and manage the interchange of information about pricing, despite the fact that the original purpose of the competitor was not to engage in forbidden anti-competitive agreements. Subjective ideas, such as intent, are exceedingly difficult to transfer and incorporate into the digital setting.\n\nThe Remedy\n\nIdentification of suspicious collusive behaviour is a significant issue because pricing algorithms have been in use for a long time; thus, it remains intriguing to assess whether we are attempting to compare anomalies with other anomalies that have become the ‘new’ normal as they have supplanted normal market conditions long ago. Scanning market developments is an important aspect of antitrust regulation in the age of pricing algorithms. Since the establishment of intention to collude remains an open question in pricing algorithms, the German Monopolies Commission specifically advises actively monitoring marketplaces for price anomalies. Against this background, it is of great utility to refer to the successful application of such a monitoring instrument in the London Interbank Offered Rate Case. The authorities used monitoring tools to monitor interest rates. They were alerted to signs of suspected collusion because of flagged interest rate changes that happened after 2007. Despite the tensions on the unsecured interbank money market, low interest rates were evidently recorded, prompting targeted screening for market manipulation and collusion in the US and Europe.\n\nWhen pricing decisions are not directly attributable to market conditions like the cost of raw materials, transportation costs, marketing costs, etc., the price stability of competing products may attract suspicion through regular monitoring by regulators. However, due to the difficulty in applying traditional notions of ‘agreements’ to such a problem, the collusive activities may not be entirely traceable. In this respect, the US Policy Council of the Association for Computing Machinery supports the imposition of liability on every user of an algorithm, even if the pricing decisions are not entirely traceable. The author is of the suggestive stance that a transition from intent to consumer harm must be effected, and the quantum of consumer harm must become a valid and feasible threshold for differentiating between unlawful collusion and permissible oligopoly action when pricing algorithms are involved.\n\nConclusion \n\nThrough the CCI Market Study on E-commerce and Competition Law Review Committee Report, it can be safely concluded that CCI has passed the denial phase of the possibility of algorithmic collusion, albeit such an acknowledgement is merely theoretical. The recent jurisprudence of CCI in the Airlines Industry and the Shikha Roy case is an appreciable development from the denial phase after the Samir Aggrawal judgement. The author remains optimistic that the two-step test by CCI will only mature and manifest practical application in time to come. On a global scale, the studies by the OECD, the German Monopolies Commission, or the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority are a strong indication of emerging instances of behavioural coordination between competing entities on account of usage of their usage of pricing algorithms. Though parallel behaviour is not identified with concerted practice in an oligopolistic market structure, the author contends that it must be regarded as significant evidence pointing to the presence of collusive parallel conduct if it leads to circumstances of competition that do not correspond to the regular conditions of the market, taking into account the unique peculiarities of the market in question. As a corollary to the argument advanced in earlier section, the strict requirement of ‘agreement’ must be diluted while adapting the ‘harm-based’ approach supported by pro-active monitoring of pricing patterns with regards to market conditions.\nCompetitionCompetition ActAlgorithmic CollusionCCI\nCompetition Law\n390 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Arbitrating IPR Disputes: Rethinking In Rem v/s In Personam Dichotomy",
        "content": "Siddhaant Verma\nMay 27\n6 min read\nArbitrating IPR Disputes: Rethinking In Rem v/s In Personam Dichotomy\n[Siddhaant is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nIndia’s fledgling ADR regime imposes several restrictions on the subject matter arbitrability of disputes. Its apprehensions of fully liberalizing are evident from Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act) which provides non-arbitrability of the subject matter as one of the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award. Owing to several public policy concerns, Indian courts have reserved certain classes of disputes exclusively for the public fora. One such category of disputes is those pertaining to intellectual property rights. While the precise judicial stance on the arbitrability of IPR disputes is unclear, arbitrability of cases that involve rights in rem is prohibited. Through this article, I argue that the in rem vs in personam test is often futile for determining the arbitrability of IPR disputes, as such disputes almost invariably involve the determination of a right in rem. Instead, I suggest a more nuanced approach to IP arbitrability, wherein all classes of disputes are made arbitrable, but their effects are limited inter partes. I argue that such a framework strikes an appropriate balance between the public policy concerns surrounding IPR arbitrability, and the economic imperative of liberalizing India’s ADR regime. \n\nCurrent Judicial Stance\n\nThe general test for subject matter arbitrability was laid down by the Supreme Court in its judgments in Booz Allen v. SBI (Booz Allen) and Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading (Vidya Drolia). In the former case, the court propounded that those disputes that involve rights in rem are generally non-arbitrable, while rights in personam are arbitrable. In Vidya Drolia, the court refined its previous holding in Booz Allen and noted that in certain cases, rights in rem can give rise to an enforceable right in personam. It also held that matters having an erga omnes effect and affecting the rights of third parties may not be arbitrated. \n\nJudicial interpretation of IPR arbitrability has developed on similar lines. In Eros International v. Telemax (Eros Telemax), the Bombay High Court allowed limited arbitrability of IPR disputes. Disputes relating to contractual licensing and infringement were held to be arbitrable as they involved rights in personam and did not affect third parties. However, the court also postulated that questions of validity and registration of IP rights are non-arbitrable, as they relate to sovereign functions of the state and have an erga omnes effect. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence surrounding this issue is far from settled as other High Court benches have delivered contradictory judgments. For instance, the Madras High Court in Sanjay Lalwani v. Joystar disregarded the Eros Telemax judgment and held that all IP disputes are inherently non-arbitrable. However, this decision has been the subject of scornful criticism in academic discourse. There is nothing inherent in IPR that makes it non-arbitrable. Intellectual property bears no intrinsic difference from tangible property (disputes relating to which are arbitrable), and there exists no discernible reason why only the former should be ousted from the domain of arbitration. Therefore, scholars generally recognize the position in Eros Telemax to be the correct.\n\nIssues with India's Position\n\nWhile the court’s decision in Eros Telemax may appear to be a nuanced one, the framework it operates in is not particularly helpful for IPR disputes. All IPR disputes invariably involve the determination of rights in rem. To illustrate, the court held that while an arbitral tribunal may pronounce judgment on trademark infringement, the question of the validity of the same trademark would be beyond its scope. However, in most trademark infringement cases, the defendant almost always invokes Section 9 of the Trademarks Act 1999 to assail the validity of the plaintiff’s mark. Section 9 provides the grounds for invalidity of a trademark, which includes inter alia descriptiveness and non-distinctiveness. This means that the court has to decide on the trademark’s validity (a right in rem) in a dispute that is technically in personam. As per the current position in India, neither of these claims would be capable of arbitration as they either involve a determination in rem or one which relates to the sovereign functions of the State (as only the State can grant monopoly over IP). If this is the case, it is evident that India’s current position of IP arbitrability would effectively prevent any IP dispute from being arbitrated. If a tribunal is going to be precluded from deciding the question of validity incidentally in an infringement action, parties would obviously prefer to take their disputes to civil courts, where they would be able to agitate their case more effectively. Circumscribing IP arbitrability to such a narrow class of disputes (to the extent that practically no disputes would be arbitrable) does not bode well for India’s desire to become an arbitration hub. \n\nThe strong impetus to have IP arbitrability is bolstered by the fact that foreign investment agreements often involve technology transfer or IP licensing. Foreign investors would obviously prefer to resolve their IP disputes through arbitration rather than the tedious civil court system. The government has also been unsuccessful at attempting to expedite the resolution of IPR disputes, as is evidenced by the failure of the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB). The collapse of the IPAB transferred all IPR cases to High Courts, further exacerbating its already overwhelming backlog. \n\nThere are several other reasons as to why arbitration would be especially appropriate for IPR disputes. Since arbitration is now explicitly recognized as a confidential process under the Act, parties would feel far more comfortable arbitrating IPR disputes involving trade secrets or sensitive patents and designs. Furthermore, since some IPRs such as patents require immense technical know-how, parties would be able to appoint expert arbitrators who are far more qualified on IP matters than generalist judges.\n\nTherefore, there clearly exist strong policy reasons for liberalizing India’s current position on IP arbitrability. Nevertheless, the policy reasons for disallowing the arbitrability of disputes concerning the validity of IP rights are equally apparent. Arbitration in such cases, especially where one party has significantly stronger bargaining power, would undermine the authority of State instrumentalities and potentially deny weaker parties access to justice if they are precluded from approaching public fora. Therefore, any arbitration framework should ideally strike an appropriate balance between the aforesaid policy considerations.\n\nWay Forward\n\nI submit that if India is to keep up with global judicial trends, it must adopt a more nuanced framework to determine IP arbitrability. I argue that arbitrators ought to be able to decide on the validity of IP rights, but this determination should not have an erga omnes effect. Instead, the outcome of the dispute should only be binding inter partes and not operate as res judicata for potential future claims. \n\nSeveral jurisdictions now follow this approach. For instance, a French court in Socie’te’ Lov Hidravlika DOO v. SA Diebolt held that an arbitrator can decide on the issue of the validity of a patent arising incidentally out of a contractual dispute, but such a determination would bind the parties alone. Article L 615-17 of the French Intellectual Property Code also provides that civil actions relating to intellectual property can be amenable to arbitration. In the United States, Section 294 of the Patent Act provides that while the validity of a patent may be decided by an arbitral tribunal, the award shall not bind third parties. I argue for a similar approach in India. For trademarks, Section 134 of the Trademarks Act 1999 provides that no court inferior to a District Court would have jurisdiction under the statute. Herein, the following clause may be added- “Nothing in this section shall prevent two parties from submitting their dispute to arbitration. Any determination of an arbitral tribunal in this regard shall only bind the parties to the dispute”. Similar clauses could also be added to other IP statutes such as those governing patents, copyright and designs. Such an approach would appropriately balance public policy concerns. On one hand, private bodies would not be able to meddle with State conferred monopolies, and on the other, a defendant’s right to raise invalidity as a ground of defence would not be curtailed.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia's current position on the arbitrability of IP disputes is inadequate and may impede the growth of India's ADR regime. If only in personam disputes are considered arbitrable, practically all IPR disputes would be transferred to the domain of civil courts. I argue for a more nuanced approach to the problem; one that takes into account the specific characteristics of different types of IP rights. Disputes relating to registrable IP rights must be considered amenable to arbitration, with the caveat that the effect of any determination relating to the validity of the IP will be inter partes. With respect to the right of publicity, which is simultaneously a fundamental right and an IP right, the current test of arbitrability unnecessarily precludes such disputes from being arbitrated. Therefore, there is a need to move beyond a strict interpretation of the in rem/in personam dichotomy and adopt an approach that strikes a balance between India’s public policy concerns and its commercial interests.\nArbitrabilityIPRDisputesIn RemIn Personam\nDispute Resolution\n92 views\n1 like.

        "title": "The Need to Revisit the Exception of ‘Ordinary Course of Business’ under IBC",
        "content": "Pratyush Singh\nMay 25\n6 min read\nThe Need to Revisit the Exception of ‘Ordinary Course of Business’ under IBC\n[Pratyush is a student at National Law School of India University, Bangalore.]\n\nSection 43(3) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) lays down the exceptions from terming certain transactions as preferential. This article looks at the exception mentioned under Section 43(3)(a) which exempts a “transfer made in the ordinary course of the business or financial affairs of the corporate debtor or the transferee.” The Supreme Court in Anuj Jain v. Axis Bank (Anuj Jain) interpreted this provision to rule that the contested transactions between Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) and Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) did not satisfy the requirements of Section 43(3)(a). It is in this context that this article attempts to argue that there is a need to revisit the interpretation of this provision owing to the unsoundness of Supreme Court’s analysis. To that end, the article, at first, briefly summarise the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Anuj Jain, and it will therea, argue that the exception should be read disjunctively, and third, present why the exception should be read subjectively. \n\nShortcomings of JIL and JAL\n\nThe Supreme Court in Anuj Jain made two observations on Section 43(3)(a). First, citing Mazagaon Dock Limited v. The Commissioner of Income-Tax, the court stated that the 'or' between 'corporate debtor' and 'the transferee' should be interpreted as 'and'. According to the court, such a purposive interpretation was required to prevent the intent of the legislature from being destroyed. If the provision were to be interpreted literally, in almost all instances of a transfer being made to a financial institution, it would fall within the ordinary course of business, which defeats the purpose of the provision. And second, with regards to the phrase 'ordinary course of business', the court stated that a transaction should form a “part of the undistinguished common flow of business done…calling for no remark and arising out of no special or particular situation.” In the instant case, the Supreme Court observed that JIL was a subsidiary created by JAL for the execution of housing/building projects. Hence, according to the court, there was no reason for a construction company to regularly mortgage its assets to get debts for its parent company. Moreover, JIL had no history (indicating the ordinary course of business) of creating encumbrances over its property. Thus, the Supreme Court relied upon the lack of continuous practice with regard to the instant transaction, and the lack of discernible reason for a construction company to carry out such a transaction to rule that this particular transaction would not fall within the ordinary course of business of JIL.\n\nPurposive Interpretation or Judicial Overreach? \n\nIn Anuj Jain, the Court seems to rely upon a supposed purposive interpretation to read ‘corporate debtor’ and ‘transferee’ conjunctively despite the use of the word ‘or’. In Babu Manmohan Das Shah v. Bishun Das, the Supreme Court had opined that a statute should be interpreted literally. The only two instances where a purposive interpretation could be taken by courts is when a literal construction of the law would either lead to absurd results or would be fundamentally against the legislature’s view. The author argues that neither of such situations exists in the present case. \n\nFirst, as observed in Sumit Binani Resolution Professional v. Excello Fin Lea Ltd, Section 43(3)(a) of the IBC has been bodily lifted from 547(c)(2)(A) of the US Bankruptcy Code. The US version of the provision uses the expression 'made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee'. Hence, the change of words for IBC can be inferred to be deliberate. Additionally, the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs refers to the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law as one of the reasons for adding provisions pertaining to avoidable transactions. The UNCITRAL Legislative Guide itself stipulates that the ‘ordinary course of business’ component requires looking at the “intention of one or both of the parties.” Thus, the legislature was fully aware of the options that existed concerning this exception. By deliberately choosing to replace the word ‘and’ with ‘or’ when lifting it from the US Bankruptcy, the intention of the legislature is discernible and hence a literal interpretation should be undertaken. \n\nSecond, reading the provision literally does not lead to absurd results. The very fact that the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide gives countries the option to look at the intent of one or both parties gives us the idea that either of the options can be adopted based on the context of each country. For example, Section 122(2)(a) of the Australian Bankruptcy Act states '[n]othing in this section affects the rights of a purchaser, payee or encumbrancer in the ordinary course of business…'. This shows that countries with both versions exist and there is no uniform approach required for this exception. Thus, solely because this version of the phrase might exempt financial institutions cannot be the only ground for the Court to read the phrase conjunctively. In fact, one of the principal reasons for this exception to exist is so that a company that is struggling financially can seek a credit line. In Re Modern Terrazzo Limited, it was observed that the reason that ordinary business transactions are exempted from the purview of preferential transactions is to ensure that financial institutions are not dis-incentivized from giving credit. Perhaps, the court was worried that if JIL was allowed to take advantage of this exception, they would be adversely impacting one of the most fundamental objectives of insolvency law: equality among creditors. If such were the case, the court could have looked at other provisions in the IBC such as undervalued transactions under Section 45 or fraudulent transactions under Section 66, which were also argued by the IRP in Anuj Jain.\n\nNeed for a Subjective Construction \n\nCircling back to the ‘ordinary course of business’ part of the Supreme Court’s analysis in Anuj Jain, we see that they focused on two components. First, the subjective component, where the company’s past practice was looked at and second, the objective component, where the general business practice of that sector was analyzed. To Supreme Court’s credit, interpreting this phrase is extremely difficult. In fact, Australia has taken this phrase out of their Corporation Act as an exception to the voidable preference transactions owing to judicial uncertainty and confusion regarding its interpretation. However, where the Supreme Court goes beyond the text of the statute is by conducting an objective analysis. The text clearly refers to 'ordinary course of the business…of the corporate debtor or the transferee,' thus signifying a subjective analysis. While Section 547 of the US Bankruptcy Code also prescribes for an objective analysis in a subsequent sub-section, the same has not been incorporated into the IBC. An objective assessment entails an analysis of the industry standard. This has been criticized for having a very difficult evidentiary standard as it does not account for variance in industry practice, and forces businesses to adopt a uniform standard of payment terms. The Supreme Court’s ratio is already being used to completely change the purpose of the provision. The National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench in a recent case stated that since no ‘prudent person’ would have acted in the way as the corporate debtor, their transaction would not fall within the exception. Besides Anuj Jain, there was no mention of any other source as to where such a standard of a prudent person was being imported from. Even if the Indian legislature were to add such an objective requirement to the exception, perhaps the approach in Tolona Pizza Prods. Corp. v. Rose Packing Co. can be adopted. In this case, it was observed that the general industry practice should only be looked at when there is no other way to access the transaction objectively. \n\nLastly, while the author agrees that the past practice of a company can be looked at for a subjective analysis, there may be instances where it is the company’s first transaction with a party or they have a very small history between them. In such a case, refusing to grant the protection under Section 43(3)(a) only because there is a lack of history of transactions between the parties is unjust in nature. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has an answer for such a situation. The court in Jubber v. SMC Electrical Products, Inc. remarked that first-time transactions can also be protected under the ordinary course of business exception. Such a protection may be granted provided that it aligns with the debtor’s or creditor’s “past practices when dealing with other, similarly situated parties.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThis article attempted to highlight the shortcomings of the court’s interpretation of the phrase ‘ordinary course of business’ in Anuj Jain. It observed that there is sufficient reason to demonstrate that the legislature wanted the phrase to be disjunctive in nature. Additionally, it was seen that IBC only envisages a subjective analysis of this exception which should be construed more liberally than what was done by the court. All of these points showcase why there is a clear need to revisit the provision either at a judicial or at a legislative level so that its actual purpose is not defeated, and companies are not unjustly punished.\nOrdinary Course of BusinessIBCAnuj JainSupreme Court\nInsolvency Law\n374 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "The MII-racle Cure: Exploring a Hybrid Approach to Corporate Governance",
        "content": "Shiv Sankar, Siddharth Melepurath\nMay 25\n5 min read\nThe MII-racle Cure: Exploring a Hybrid Approach to Corporate Governance\n[Shiv and Siddharth are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nMarket Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) form the backbone of financial markets, providing essential services such as trading, clearing, and settlement. Their importance cannot be overstated, and therefore, ensuring their proper governance is critical.\n\nHowever, as with any system, there is always room for improvement. The existing governance framework for MIIs in India has been reviewed by a committee headed by G. Mahalingam, which has made 15 key recommendations to strengthen MII governance norms. These recommendations cover many issues, including transparency, accountability, and independence.\n\nA relook at the governance of MIIs is the need of the hour, and this article aims to explore the various aspects of this topic. This article will delve into the intricacies of governance in the context of MIIs.\n\nKey Recommendations by the Committee\n\nOne of the critical issues addressed by the committee was a ‘balanced approach’ to the regulation of MIIs, instead of a purely ‘rule-based’ or ‘principle-based’ approach. The committee’s recommendations aim to strike a balance between these approaches, promoting innovation and protecting public interest simultaneously. As a result, the committee’s recommendations hold significance in strengthening the governance norms for MIIs and ensuring that they maintain their regulatory roles without hindering innovation. \n\nThe committee has proposed such recommendations after consulting various stakeholders and reviewing past committee reports. These recommendations are geared towards strengthening MII governance norms while remaining focused on their regulatory roles. The recommendations cover various aspects which include categorising MII functions into verticals, giving higher priority to key managerial personnel, requiring a board with two-thirds public interest directors, setting guiding principles for the senior management team, enhancing transparency, emphasising accountability and objective appraisals, amending regulations for compensation, and rationalising codes of conduct and ethics. \n\nHowever, shifting towards a principle-based approach or saying that a balanced approach needs to be followed, without defining or attempting to explain what such balanced approach means in the report, is in itself subjective in nature. Such subjectivity leads to ambiguity and inconsistencies in enforcement.\n\nAnalysis of the Impact of the Recommendations\n\nProponents of the principle-based approach argue that it is more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. Instead of being bound by rigid rules, market participants can use their judgement to interpret and apply principles in a way that is appropriate for situations at hand. This leads to more innovative and efficient solutions to regulatory problems.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of the rule-based approach argue that it provides greater clarity and certainty for market participants. By laying out clear rules and guidelines, participants know exactly what is expected of them and can act accordingly. This can lead to greater compliance and a more level playing field for all market participants.\n\nIn order to clearly identify which approach should be followed, it is essential to look at a few factors pertaining to regulation, characteristics of market participants as well as the general nature of markets. \n\nFactors pertaining to regulation\n\nIn situations where there is a requirement for swift action to be taken in order to regulate the volatility of markets, it is always better to follow a principle-based approach. On the other hand, if there is prevalent conduct deviating from established market practices, a rule-based approach to governance will be more effective. Further, in conditions where there is asymmetry of information between the regulatory and regulated bodies, a set of core principles which can act as a regulatory measure without imposing rules, which may restrict activities of such bodies.\n\nFactors pertaining to characteristics of market participants \n\nWhether market participants are retail or institutional is also an important factor in determining the correct approach to be followed while framing regulations. Historically, rule-based approaches have been followed to safeguard retail investors because institutional investors are more sophisticated and are in a position to protect their own self-interests, where principle-based approaches come into play. \n\nFactors pertaining to the general nature of markets\n\nIn a world where technology is rapidly evolving, a principle-based approach is more suitable as a rule-based approach is seen to act as a barrier to innovation and progress.  Market maturity levels are also to be considered to apply a mixture of principles and rules, and pertaining to different situations, principles may be further developed into consistent practices and rules.\n\nConsidering and applying the aforementioned factors in taking decisions related to which approach to be followed serves as a measure to reduce the ambiguity that currently exists with regard to the enforcement of the balanced approach. It is important to have clarity over the situations in which particular approaches are to be followed. \n\nWhile SEBI recognises that such balance needs to be maintained, it does not delve into how exactly is such balanced approach proposed to be followed, effectively rendering the approach to be a principle-based one, and thereby arising ambiguity.\n\nStriking the Right Balance: A Hybrid Approach\n\nRegulatory practices often involve a blend of principle-based and rule-based approaches, with each approach having its strengths and limitations. While some regulatory regimes may emphasize one approach over the other, hybrid regulatory systems that combine both principles and rules are becoming more common. These hybrid systems can provide greater flexibility to address the complex and dynamic nature of regulatory challenges while also maintaining clear guidance for those being regulated.\n\nTake National Stock Exchange as an example; it is a self-regulatory organization that operates as a regulatory and profit-making entity, similar to public sector undertakings. As such, it is responsible for ensuring compliance with market rules and maintaining fair and transparent trading practices while generating revenue through fees for services such as stock listings, trading, and data dissemination.\n\nIn case of MIIs, by combining both rule-based and principle-based approaches, they can reap the benefits of both while minimizing the potential limitations of these individual approaches. One example of a hybrid approach is to combine a binding rule-based approach with non-binding guidelines or safe harbours, which can provide regulatees (people being regulated) flexibility while reducing uncertainty. Similarly, a binding principle-based approach can be paired with non-binding rules to help regulatees understand the broader regulatory goals being pursued.\n\nThe United States has traditionally favoured a rule-based approach, while the United Kingdom has tended to favour a principle-based approach. India, as an emerging market, could potentially benefit from adopting elements of both approaches. For example, India could introduce more detailed rules to provide greater legal certainty and investor protection while also relying on high-level principles and broad standards to promote innovation and flexibility.\n\nThe primary concern with a hybrid approach is the risk of gaming, where regulatees may seek out loopholes in the rules to avoid compliance. However, this risk can be mitigated through careful design and implementation of the hybrid model. For example, regulatees could be required to justify how their actions are consistent with the relevant regulatory objectives if they choose not to follow a specific rule. Additionally, a system of checks and balances could be put in place to ensure that regulatees are not abusing the flexibility provided by the principle-based approach.\n\nBy consistently monitoring and refining the hybrid model, MIIs in India can adapt to the rapidly evolving market and promote sustainable growth. This emphasizes the importance of policymakers and regulators in India to remain vigilant and continuously evaluate the hybrid governance model to ensure its effectiveness. In doing so, they can draw on best practices from other jurisdictions and incorporate them into the hybrid model to create a regulatory framework that is tailored to India's unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe governance of MIIs is of utmost importance in ensuring trust and accountability in financial markets. By promoting innovation while maintaining regulatory stability and reducing compliance costs, a clearer hybrid approach can help MIIs adapt to the rapidly evolving market and promote sustainable growth. \n\nTherefore, there is a need for SEBI to clearly lay down in what manner the proposed balanced approach is to be followed. This requires careful design and monitoring of the hybrid model to mitigate potential risks and ensure that it remains effective in achieving its goals over time. Policymakers and regulators in India should consider the adoption of a more structured hybrid governance model for MIIs and draw on best practices from other jurisdictions to ensure its success.\nMarket Infrastructure InstitutionsSEBIFinancial Market\nCorporate Law\n185 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "Personal and Non-Personal Data in Digital India: Before and After",
        "content": "Deborshi Barat\nMay 21\n13 min read\nPersonal and Non-Personal Data in Digital India: Before and After\n[Deborshi is a Counsel at S&R Associates. The article was published here.]\n\nThis piece focuses on distinguishing between personal and non-personal data, including with respect to their separate regulatory, legal, and commercial implications. This note is divided into two sections. In Section I, we provide a brief summary of whether, and how, India’s existing data protection framework addresses the definitions of, and the difference between, personal and non-personal data, respectively. In Section II, we provide an overview of India’s legislative trajectory with respect to defining, and distinguishing between, the two.\n\nSeries Background\n\nIn the last few years, significant global progress has been made in terms of generating awareness about, and protecting, personal data. In particular, the ripple effects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) have spread to, and influenced, the rest of the world – including India – especially with respect to the latter’s ongoing efforts to overhaul its existing data protection framework. \n\nHowever, despite an apparent international convergence around key aspects, major gaps in understanding persist, especially when it comes to unpacking the contours of personal data with regard to its antithesis, i.e., non-personal data (NPD). While, until recently, conditions in India, too, exemplified these gaps, certain recent developments hold promise for the future.\n\nToday, analyzing the conceptual framework and regulatory trajectory of NPD has assumed additional importance – particularly for a country like India, poised as it is on the cusp of a new digital governance architecture. Accordingly, it is time to examine the techno-legal challenges, sovereign priorities, and socioeconomic concerns related to NPD, even while discussing its opportunities and allied issues. \n\nIf ‘non-personal data’ is simply defined as data that is not personal (see the explanation to Clause 91(2) of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, which was introduced in, and withdrawn from, Indian parliament in December 2019 and August 2022, respectively), we need to revisit the concept of personal data to check for what it is – and isn’t. Accordingly, for the purpose of distinguishing personal data from NPD, a preliminary requirement is to trace its conceptual paradigm and various categories. Further, its processing-related elements must be re-examined, including with reference to notice, consent, and breach – as well as in light of some extraordinary innovations proposed under Indian law relative to GDPR, such as in respect of ‘deemed’ consent, sensitivity, volume, and harm, and relatedly, ‘significant data fiduciaries’.\n\nIn that regard, the scope and limits of personal data (along with India-specific challenges) ought to be ascertained by comparing local cultural requirements, including those associated with its meaning. Thus, a thorough definitional deconstruction, including with reference to existing and draft laws in both Europe and India, is useful to unearth a core aspect of personal data – one that most clearly distinguishes it from its non-personal equivalent: i.e., identifiability.\n\nNevertheless, while addressing identifiability, what must be viewed is the whole spectrum that lends itself for personal and non-personal data to transmute within, and inhabit, in their distinctive forms, including with the help of de-identification techniques such as anonymization and pseudonymization. However, such distinctions within the personal / non-personal continuum have increasingly become blurry on account of the rising use of mixed datasets and de-anonymized data, the regulation of which has demanded urgent regulatory attention – including in India.\n\nWhile anonymization processes conducted on personal data are intended to yield non-personal outputs, the latter’s ambit – better understood now than in previous eras – appears to be significantly more expansive than hitherto imagined, along with appurtenant complications and opportunities. Accordingly, while India’s plans to domesticate NPD through sovereign muscle for a better digital future has increasingly mirrored Europe’s trajectory in this regard, the former’s ambitions now extend to becoming a cloud computing and data center hub, including through the establishment of ‘data embassies’.\n\nPersonal and Non-Personal Data under India’s Existing Data Protection Framework\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt present, India regulates the use of data under the Information Technology Act 2000, as amended, including by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008 (2008 Amendment, and collectively, IT Act), along with allied rules, such as the Information Technology (Certifying Authorities) Rules, 2000, as amended – the latter of which deals with digital signatures, including with respect to their creation, verification, standards, and certification, among other things.\n\nFurther, additional rules related to the IT Act include the following:\nThe Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules 2011 (discussed further below) – which: (1) require entities holding sensitive personal information of users to maintain certain security standards, as well as (2) specify and prescribe security standards for personal information stored electronically.\nFollowing the 2008 Amendment (especially with respect to providing an exemption to intermediaries from liability for any third-party information), the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules 2011 (2011 Rules) were framed – which provided due diligence requirements for intermediaries, prohibited content of a specific nature on the internet, and required intermediaries such as website hosts to block such content. \nSubsequently, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “2021 Rules”) were notified in February 2021, replacing the 2011 Rules. Key changes under the 2021 Rules included additional due diligence requirements for certain social media intermediaries, and a framework for regulating the content of online publishers with respect to news and current affairs, as well as curated audio-visual content. The 2021 Rules were further amended in 2022. \n\nEarlier this year, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) published draft amendments to the revised 2021 Rules on its website with respect to due diligence by an intermediary under Rule 3, inviting feedback from the public. More recently, MeitY notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules 2023 (2023 Amendment Rules) – which amended the 2021 Rules further, and especially in terms of: (a) online gaming; (b) due diligence by intermediaries – including social media, significant social media, and online gaming intermediaries, respectively; as well as (c) grievance redressal. The 2023 Amendment Rules came into effect on 6 April 2023.\n\nOther rules under the IT Act include the following (in addition to the ones mentioned above): \nThe Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Cafe) Rules 2011 – which require cybercafés to: (1) register with a registration agency, (2) identify users and maintain a log of identity of such users, as well as (3) maintain records of their internet use.\nThe Information Technology (Electronic Service Delivery) Rules 2011 – which allow the government to specify that certain services, such as applications, certificates, licenses, forms, etc., are required to be delivered electronically, and also provide a framework for the electronic delivery of such services.\nFurther, additional ancillary and/or sector-specific regulations also exist, such as the Information Technology (the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team and the Manner of Performing Functions and Duties) Rules 2013; the directions and guidelines issued by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), including in respect of cybersecurity; the Consumer Protection Act 2019; the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules 2020; and rules published by various regulatory authorities such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), each of which governs different facets of data protection based on their respective jurisdictions. \n\nDP framework\n\nMore specifically, however, the data protection framework in India (DP Framework) stems from Section 43A of the IT Act (titled “Compensation for failure to protect data”), along with its subordinate rules, viz. the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules 2011 (SPDI). \n\nAlthough Explanations (ii) and (iii) of Section 43A of the IT Act define both ‘reasonable security practices and procedures’ and ‘sensitive personal data or information,’ such terms are described in greater detail in SPDI under Rules 8 and 3, respectively. Further, provisions such as Rule 4 (“Body corporate to provide policy for privacy and disclosure of information”), Rule 5 (“Collection of information”), Rule 6 (“Disclosure of information”), and Rule 7 (“Transfer of information”) of SPDI aim to address various discrete requirements of the DP Framework.\n\nPersonal and non-personal data under the existing DP framework\n While Section 43A of the IT Act, read with Rule 3 of SPDI, separately defines ‘sensitive personal data or information,’ the definition of ‘data’ under the IT Act does not appear to exclude non-personal data from its ambit. \n\nExplanation (iii) of Section 43A of the IT Act defines ‘sensitive personal data or information’ as “such personal information as may be prescribed by the central government in consultation with such professional bodies or associations as it may deem fit.” Rule 3 of SPDI further clarifies that sensitive personal data or information of a person means such personal information which consists of information relating to certain specified items, including passwords, financial information (such as details related to a bank account, credit/debit card, or other payment instrument), and biometric information. \n\nMeanwhile, Section 2(1)(o) of the IT Act defines ‘data’ as “a representation of information, knowledge, facts, concepts or instructions which are being prepared or have been prepared in a formalised manner, and is intended to be processed, is being processed or has been processed in a computer system or computer network, and may be in any form (including computer printouts magnetic or optical storage media, punched cards, punched tapes) or stored internally in the memory of the computer.”\n\nSection 43A of the IT Act also refers to ‘information in a computer resource.’ However, neither of the definitions related to ‘information’ or ‘computer resource’ appears to contemplate personal data alone. For instance, Section 2(1)(v) of the IT Act defines ‘information’ to include data, message, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer programs, software and databases, microfilm, or computer generated microfiche. Further, Section 2(1)(k) of the IT Act defines ‘computer resource’ as a computer, computer system, computer network, data, computer database, or software – where each of such constituent terms, other than the last two (i.e., computer database and software, respectively), are separately defined in the IT Act in Section 2(1)(i), (l), (j), and (o), respectively.\n\nNevertheless, SPDI defines ‘personal information’ using language that appears to have inspired the eventual definition of ‘personal data’ under India’s current draft of the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022 (DPDP), released by MeitY in November last year for public comments. Thus, Rule 2(1)(i) of SPDI defines ‘personal information’ as “any information that relates to a natural person, which, either directly or indirectly, in combination with other information available or likely to be available with a body corporate, is capable of identifying such person.” Meanwhile, Clause 2(13) of DPDP defines ‘personal data’ as “any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data.”\n\nSimilarly, the definition of ‘data’ under DPDP is more or less consistent with its equivalent under the IT Act – albeit more streamlined than before – adding components such as suitability of communication and interpretation, respectively, along with human or automated processing. Thus, Clause 2(4) of DPDP defines ‘data’ as “a representation of information, facts, concepts, opinions or instructions in a manner suitable for communication, interpretation or processing by humans or by automated means.” Interestingly, the definition of ‘data’ under DPDP, too, does not appear to preclude non-personal data as such.\n\nIndia’s Legislative Trajectory on Personal and Non-Personal Data\n\nAs discussed above, the existing DP Framework stems from Section 43A of the IT Act, including SPDI. However, in the absence of a standalone and/or dedicated domestic law on data protection, and in light of perceived inadequacies in the DP Framework – a white paper (White Paper) on a revised paradigm was released in December 2017 by a government-constituted expert committee (Expert Committee). \n\nExpert Committee and the White Paper\n\nIn the White Paper, the Expert Committee noted that data which is viewed as non-personal information can be combined with other datasets to create personally identifiable information, including via de-anonymization techniques. Accordingly, it was possible for personal or non-personal data, when processed using ‘big data’ analytics, to be transformed into sensitive personal data.\n\nIn addition, the Expert Committee observed that research studies had concluded that it was difficult to distinguish between personal and non-personal data, and further, recognized the need to treat different types of personal data differently. \n\nPursuant to public comments to the White Paper and multi-city consultations, the Expert Committee submitted a report on a free and fair digital economy in July 2018 (EC Report) along with a draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2018 (PDP 18). At that time, the EU had recently enacted GDPR, which came into force in May 2018, replacing the EU’s erstwhile Data Protection Directive of 1995. \n\nThe EC Report\n\nIn the EC Report, the Expert Committee admitted that its deliberations had raised questions related to non-personal data, especially in connection with emerging activities involving data processing which hold considerable strategic and economic interest for the country.\n\nPDP 18\n\nNevertheless, PDP 18 dealt with personal data only. Its Clause 2 was titled “Application of the Act to processing of personal data”. Moreover, sub-clause (3) of Clause 2 clearly specified that PDP 18 would not apply to the processing of anonymized data either.\n\nIn addition, Clause 105 of PDP 18 was specifically titled “No application to non-personal data”. The provision further specified that nothing contained in PDP 18 would affect the power of the central government to formulate appropriate policies for the digital economy as long as such policies did not govern personal data. \n\nPDP 19 \n\nA year and a half after the EC Report was released, in December 2019, based on suggestions from the Expert Committee and various stakeholders, the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 (PDP 19) was introduced.  Like its predecessor, PDP 19 aimed to protect personal data (see Clause 2 of PDP 19), the meaning of which it expanded upon from PDP 18 (see Clause 3(29) of PDP 18) but defined somewhat similarly (i.e., as data about or relating to a natural person who is directly or indirectly identifiable – see Clause 3(28) of PDP 19). However, while Clause 2(3) of PDP 18 had clearly stated that the law would not apply to the processing of anonymized data, Clause 2(B) of PDP 19 clarified that such non-application was subject to Clause 91. As such, the definitions of ‘anonymization’ and ‘anonymized data’ in PDP 19 remained the same as in PDP 18, except that the former specifically articulated the standard of ‘irreversibility’ (see Clause 3(2) of PDP 19).\n\nMeanwhile, Clause 91(1) of PDP 19 mirrored Clause 105 of PDP 18 (as discussed above), and Clause 91(2) empowered the central government to direct any data fiduciary or data processor towards providing any anonymized personal data or other non-personal data for certain specified purposes – including for the purpose of better targeting of service delivery or formulation of evidence-based policies by the central government. Importantly, Clause 91(2) of PDP 19 contained a rudimentary definition of non-personal data (as ‘data other than personal data’) – albeit for the purpose of that provision alone. \n\nHowever, various provisions in PDP 19 were inconsistent with contemporaneous data protection laws in key jurisdictions. For instance, by dint of its provisions on non-personal data, PDP 19 diverged from equivalent legislations of that period, including those in the EU, Australia, and Canada. \n\nJC Report\n\nAlong with its parliamentary introduction, PDP 19 had been referred to a joint committee (Joint Committee). After 78 sittings conducted over two years, the Joint Committee’s report (JC Report) was presented before parliament in December 2021. \n\nWhile PDP 19 had tentatively defined non-personal data as data other than personal data, the JC Report observed that it was impossible to clearly distinguish between the two (i.e., between personal and non-personal data, respectively) – since data was collected, and indeed moved, en masse – so much so that data segregation into specific categories of ‘personal’ and ‘non-personal’ was impossible to achieve, including on account of data eclecticism at various levels of security.\n\nHence, the first recommendation in the JC Report was to ensure that PDP 19 dealt with both personal and non-personal data. It further recommended that PDP 19 ought to protect all kinds of data, and the regulatory authority should be empowered to regulate non-personal data as well, including in respect of breaches. Moreover, it was suggested that the short title of PDP 19 ought to be changed to the ‘Data Protection Act 2021’ (Proposed DP Act).\n\nFor the purpose of avoiding turf battles and regulatory confusion, the JC Report recommended a single administrative body. Accordingly, if such a body was poised to handle both personal and non-personal data, any further policy or legal framework on non-personal data was required to be made a part of PDP 19 (instead of being introduced as a separate legislation). In this regard, the JC Report suggested that as soon as the provisions to regulate non-personal data were finalized, there could be a separate regulatory framework on non-personal data within the Proposed DP Act.\n\nProposed DP Act\n\nThe Proposed DP Act (called the ‘Data Protection Bill 2021’) – which represented an amalgam of revisions made to PDP 19 by the Joint Committee – was included within the JC Report (see p. 475 (handwritten p. 463) onwards). Consistent with the JC Report, the Proposed DP Act amended Clause 2 of PDP 19 to make the new law applicable to the processing of non-personal data as well (along with personal data), including in respect of anonymized personal data (see Clause 2(d) of the Proposed DC Act). Also, it added a definition of ‘data breach’ (see Clause 3(14) of the Proposed DC Act), which included breaches of non-personal data as well (see Clauses 3(28) and 3(29) of the Proposed DC Act).\n\nSimilar to Clause 105 of PDP 18 and Clause 91(1) of PDP 19, respectively, a separate provision in the Proposed DC Act specified that nothing contained in it would affect the power of the central government to formulate appropriate policies for the digital economy. However, unlike in previous versions, the Proposed DC Act specifically referred to policy-framing with respect to the handling of non-personal data (including with respect to anonymized personal data).\n\nDG Committee\n\nDespite the Joint Committee’s eventual recommendation about including both personal and non-personal data within the same statute, on account of lingering uncertainties about the advisability of such a move – MeitY had constituted a committee of experts in September 2019 (i.e., a few months before the Joint Committee was established) to deliberate on a framework for data governance (DG Committee). In particular, the DG Committee was mandated to examine issues relating to, and make specific suggestions about regulating, non-personal data.\n\nFirst DGC Report\n\nA draft version of the DG Committee’s first report was released in July 2020 (First DGC Report). Among other things, the First DGC Report provided a definition of non-personal data and divided such data into three categories involving public, community, and private perspectives, respectively. It also proposed a separate legislation to regulate non-personal data, including through the establishment of a ‘Non-Personal Data Authority’ (NPDA). \n\nRevised DGC Report\n\nPursuant to stakeholder feedback with respect to the First DGC Report, the DG Committee proposed a revised version (Revised DGC Report) a few months later. In the Revised DGC Report, the DG Committee clarified the definition of non-personal data and re-examined the legal basis for asserting sovereign and community rights over non-personal data. However, the Revised DGC Report did retain certain key features of the First DGC Report, including those related to consent for anonymized data and an NPDA.\n\nA more detailed analysis of the proposed data governance framework, as mentioned above, including with respect to non-personal data, will be provided in the next note of this series.\n\nNDGFP\n\nIn May last year, MeitY had released a draft of the ‘National Data Governance Framework Policy’ for public consultation (NDGFP). The NDGFP aims to ensure that non-personal and anonymized data from both government and private entities are accessible by research and innovation ecosystems, including for the purpose of facilitating academic output and R&D initiatives by Indian start-ups. \n\nIn February this year, while presenting the Union Budget for FY 2023-24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicated that the NDGFP might be finalized soon, enabling access to anonymized data (see here and here, for example).\n\nProposed Digital India Bill\n\nAccording to recent media reports, the government may frame rules for sharing non-personal data under a new law – including in respect of devices related to the ‘Internet-of-Things’ (IoT). In this regard, a draft bill (Proposed Digital India Bill) may be ready within a few months’ time. It is possible that certain recommendations of the Revised DGC Report will be factored in with respect to the Proposed Digital India Bill, especially in connection with the sharing of non-personal data. \n\nCurrent status\n\nPDP 19 was withdrawn in August 2022, including on account of the (large) scale of recommended changes made to it by the Joint Committee. A couple of months later, in November last year, the present draft of DPDP was released by MeitY for public comments. According to recent media reports, a revised draft of DPDP, pursuant to public feedback received in respect of the November draft, will be tabled before Parliament in July 2023.\nPersonal DataSPDIDigital IndiaInformation Technology\nCommercial Law\n86 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Cross-Border Merger Framework in India: Limited Efficacy?",
        "content": "Rajat Sethi, Sumit Bansal, Oshika Nayak\nMay 20\n7 min read\nCross-Border Merger Framework in India: Limited Efficacy?\n[Rajat and Sumit are Partners and Oishika is an Associate at S&R Associates. The article was first published on The Legal 500.]\n\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified Section 234 of the Companies Act 2013, as amended (Companies Act), and Rule 25A of the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules 2016, as amended (Companies Merger Rules), on 13 April 2017, to permit merger and amalgamation of a foreign company with and into an Indian company and vice versa. Further, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notified the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations 2018, as amended (FEMA Merger Regulations), on 20 March 2018, to address the gaps in the existing framework from a foreign exchange perspective.\n\nKey Provisions under the Companies Act \n\nPrior to 2013, the merger or amalgamation of an Indian company with a foreign company was not permitted under the Companies Act 1956, as amended (Erstwhile Act). The Erstwhile Act defined 'transferee company' to only include companies incorporated in India and restricted the scope of cross-border mergers to mergers of foreign companies with and into Indian companies.\n\nHowever, Section 234 of the Companies Act removed this restriction and made Chapter XV (Compromise, Arrangement and Amalgamations) applicable to all cross-border mergers. Accordingly, Section 234 of the Companies Act, read with Rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules, provides the framework for cross-border mergers in India. \n\nPursuant to such provisions, the concerned company is required to seek prior approval from the RBI for any merger or amalgamation with a foreign company or Indian company, as applicable, and file an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in accordance with Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act and the applicable rules. The scheme for merger may provide for payment of consideration to the shareholders of the merging company in cash, depository receipts or partly in cash and depository receipts, and is required to comply with the requirements of Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, including approval from the shareholders, creditors, tax authorities, etc.\n\nHowever, the scope for merger of an Indian company with a foreign company is limited to the jurisdictions identified under the Companies Merger Rules. This includes foreign companies incorporated in the jurisdiction:\nwhose securities market regulator is a signatory to International Organisation of Securities Commission's Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or has a bilateral MoU with the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), or\nwhose central bank is a member of the Bank for Internal Settlements, and \nwhich has not been identified in the public statement of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as: (a) a jurisdiction having a strategic Anti-Money Laundering or Combating the Financing of Terrorism deficiencies to which counter measures apply, or (b) as a jurisdiction that has not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or has not committed to an action plan developed by the FATF to address the deficiencies.\nOn 30 May 2022, the MCA notified amendments to Rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules introducing a new requirement for filing Form No. CAA-16 along with the application filed before the NCLT to confirm government approval in case of a merger with a company incorporated in a country sharing land border with India.\n\nKey Provisions under the FEMA Merger Regulations\n\nThe FEMA Merger Regulations define cross-border merger to mean, “any merger, amalgamation or arrangement between an Indian company and foreign company in accordance with Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamation) Rules, 2016 notified under the Companies Act, 2013.” The regulations have further classified cross-border mergers as: (i) inbound mergers- where the resultant company is an Indian company, and (ii) outbound mergers - where the resultant company is a foreign company. Any merger which is undertaken in accordance with the FEMA Merger Regulations will be deemed to have prior approval of the RBI for the purpose of Rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules provided the following conditions are met (if any of such conditions are not met, prior RBI approval will be required): \n\nTransfer of securities\n\nIn case of an inbound merger:\nThe resultant company may transfer its securities to a person resident outside subject to the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations 2017, as amended (FEMA 20-R). With effect from 17 17 October 2019, the FEMA 20-R stands superseded by the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules 2019, the Foreign Exchange Management (Debt Instruments) Regulations 2019 and the Foreign Exchange Management (Mode of Payment and Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) Regulations 2019. Accordingly, references in the FEMA Merger Regulations to the FEMA 20-R should now be replaced with the above foreign exchange rules and regulations, as applicable. \nIf such merger involves a foreign company, then additional compliance is required with respect to the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of any Foreign Security) Regulations 2004, as amended (TIFS Regulations). With effect from 22 August 2022, the TIFS Regulations stand superseded by the Foreign Investment (Overseas Investment) Rules 2022 (Overseas Investment Rules). Accordingly, references in the FEMA Merger Regulations to the TIFS Regulations should now be replaced with the Overseas Investment Rules. \nIn addition, in case of an outbound merger, a resident individual may acquire or hold securities in the resultant company in accordance with the limits of the Liberalized Remittance Scheme provided under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1992, as amended and regulations issued thereunder (FEMA).\n\nBranch / office outside India\n\nPursuant to an inbound merger, the office of the foreign company would be deemed to be the branch/office of the resultant company outside India under the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Account by a Person Resident in India) Regulations 2015, as amended.\n\nFurther, pursuant to an outbound merger, the office of the Indian company would be deemed to be the branch office of the resultant company in India under the Foreign Exchange Management (Establishment in India of a Branch Office or a Liaison Office or a Project Office or Any Other Place of Business) Regulations 2016, as amended. Typically, the business income of such branch office of the foreign company (derived from its operations in India) would be taxed at 40% plus applicable surcharge and cess. \n\nBorrowings and guarantees\nPursuant to an inbound merger, the borrowings and guarantees of the foreign company from overseas sources vest with the resultant company and such company is required to ensure compliance with the FEMA within a period of two years. No remittance is permitted to be made from India for repayment of the liability during such period and the condition with respect to end use is not applicable.\nIn case of an outbound merger, the outstanding borrowings and guarantees of the Indian company vest with the resultant company and are required to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the scheme sanctioned by the NCLT. The resultant company is not permitted to acquire any INR liability which is payable to a lender in India unless it is compliant with the FEMA and obtains no-objection certification from Indian lenders to that effect.\nAcquisition and transfer of assets\n\nThe resultant company may acquire and hold assets outside India or in India, as permitted under the FEMA and transfer it in the manner permitted therein. Any asset or security of the resultant company contravening the FEMA is required to be sold within two years from the sanction of the scheme by NCLT and the sale proceeds are required to be repatriated outside India or to India, as applicable. The resultant company may thereafter use such sale proceeds to repay any existing liability in India or outside India, as applicable.\n\nBank accounts\n\nThe resultant company pursuant to an inbound merger may maintain an overseas bank account for the transactions relating to the cross-border merger for a maximum period of two years from the sanction of the scheme by the NCLT.\nIn case of an outbound merger, the resultant company may open a Special Non-Resident Rupee Account under the Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations 2016, as amended, for a similar period.\nValuation\n\nValuation of the merging companies is required to be undertaken in accordance with Rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules. Additionally, for an outbound merger, the valuer is required to be a member of a recognised professional body in such jurisdiction and the valuation is required to follow international accounting and valuation standards.\n\nTax Implications\n\nThe exemptions under the Income-tax Act 1961 (IT Act) for tax neutrality of merger are available only if the transferee company is an Indian company. Such exemptions are not available in case of merger of an Indian company with a foreign company. Accordingly, the Indian company and its shareholders could be liable to tax in case of merger of an Indian company with a foreign company.\nIt is also relevant to highlight Section 72A of the IT Act which provides for carry forward and set off of accumulated tax business losses and unabsorbed depreciation in case the merger complies with certain specified conditions. In terms of Section 72A, such benefit will not be available in case of outbound mergers. In addition, in case of inbound mergers, tax losses of the foreign company may not qualify as ‘accumulated losses’ under the provisions of IT Act and therefore may lapse.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facilitation of outbound mergers under the current legal framework has expanded the scope of cross-border mergers in India. However, as a practical matter, the framework for cross-border mergers in India remains of limited efficacy. Such framework has so far largely been utilized only in the context of merger of foreign wholly owned subsidiaries with and into the Indian holding company or vice versa. \n\nThis appears to be on account of several reasons, including: (a) the nature of the conditions for deemed RBI approval under the FEMA Merger Regulations (prior RBI approval is required if such conditions are not met), (b) lack of clarity regarding demergers (Section 234 of the Companies Act refers to mergers and amalgamations only instead of compromise and/or arrangement as used in Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act), and (c) absence of tax benefits in relation to outbound mergers that are otherwise available for domestic mergers subject to specified conditions, including absence of a provision for carry forward and set off of accumulated tax business losses and unabsorbed depreciation.\nCross-BorderMergersCompanies ActFEMAIncome-Tax Act\nCorporate Law\n128 views\n1 like.

        "title": "The Settlement and Commitment Mechanism: A New Dawn in the Competition Law Regime",
        "content": "Shreya Sharma\nMay 14\n6 min read\nThe Settlement and Commitment Mechanism: A New Dawn in the Competition Law Regime\n[Shreya is a student at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Punjab.]\n\nAfter the Presidential assent on 11 April 2023, the much-awaited new competition amendment has been unfurled amidst contemporary advancements in the competition regime in India. Certain keystone changes that are spelled out are introduction of a deal threshold value as a conditional pre-requisite for regulation of mergers and acquisition in India, revised definition of 'turnover' to reflect worldwide turnover, and broadened scope of cartel prosecution. Among other things, introduction of a settlement and commitment mechanism is a noteworthy addition, which is an effort to decrease litigation and facilitate a simpler and quicker dispute resolution alternative mechanism. In light of the present competition legal framework in India and several unsolved questions, the author attempts to analyze the newly added provisions including its application and implications.   \n\nNew Provisions\n\nIn the ruling of Tamil Nadu Exhibitors Association v. Competition Commission of India, the  Madras High Court noted that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has broad residuary powers, the natural outcome of which could be the adoption of a settlement or compromise between parties over an antitrust problem. Taking inspiration from the matured foreign antitrust regimes along with the aforesaid ruling, the amendment attempts to bring in the framework for the settlements and commitments mechanism by adding Section 48A and Section 48B of the Competition Act 2002 (Act). 'Settlement' introduces an alternative route to resolve any violation of the anti-trust laws by any party and is a rather unconventional mechanism that has not yet become very popular, especially in countries other than the first world countries. The party that has been charged for violation or 'contravention' is required to admit the commission of such anti-competitive behavioral activities owing to enough evidence in the affirmative with the CCI after a full investigation. Subsequently, the CCI will have the authority to put an end to the proceedings based on the form, graveness, and effect of the violation or contravention. This resolution may be seen as a final order because since it more like an agreement between the parties, appeals cannot be initiated against these settlements. Notably, the CCI will be the main and last authority concerned in such cases. \n\n'Commitment' primarily means that the enterprise against which the anti-competitive proceedings have been initiated has to agree to comply with a certain set of rules or more appropriately known as ‘behavioral remedies’. As a result, the initial proceedings as identified by the CCI may be terminated on account of such effective terms and methods of implementation as offered. It must be highlighted that the decision has to be made keeping in mind the interests of all the stakeholders involved including the interests of the parties involved in the investigation, the interests of the third parties and of the market conditions in general. They are a more effective compliance tool because they usually result in quicker and palpable remedies and changes.\n\nAn entity or enterprise against which an inquiry has commenced under Section 26(1) for a violation of Section 3(4) or Section 4 of the Act may submit an application under Section 48A(1) and 48B(2) of the Act. According to Section 48A(2), the settlement application may be submitted at any time after receiving the directive of the Directorate General (DG) but before the order is actually passed. As per Section 48A(3) of Act, the regulator may accept the proposal for settlement if the applicant pays the specified amount or subject to other terms and conditions for implementation of settlement and monitoring as specified in the regulations after taking into account the nature, the seriousness, and the impact of the violation or contravention. Additionally, while taking the proposal in consideration, the CCI is required to offer a window for the party involved, the DG, or any other third party to submit their suggestions and objections. If the CCI has opined that the proposed settlement has not reached a satisfactory outcome and there is a deadlock, it would reject the aforesaid proposal and proceed with the inquiry as per provisions in Section 26(1) of the Act. All settlement payments realised under the Act must be credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.      \n\nAlternatively, the parties facing accusations of anti-competitive behaviour may make agreements to change or alter their conduct (commitment). The commitment offer may be made at any time following the CCI's adoption of an order under Section 26(1) of Act, but within the window of time until the party receives the Director General's report as required by Section 26(4). According to Section 48 B(3) of the Act, the CCI has the final say on whether to accept applications for such mechanism, and it shall make judgements based on the nature, the seriousness, the impact, and the efficacy of the commitments. The CCI can reject the proposed application and proceed with its procedure under Section 26 of Act. There shall be no right of appeal under Section 53B of the Act against any order made by the CCI under the provisions of these sections. \n\nSimilar Provisions outside India\n\nEuropean Union \n\nThe settlement method was first implemented by the European Commission, which is in charge of the antitrust regulation in Europe, but the commitment mechanism was adopted after a period of time through Article 9 of Regulation 1/2003. The European Commission first restricted settlements to instances involving cartels and vertical breaches, that were subject to the procedural rules set down in Regulation (EC) No 622/2008. It has, however, lately implemented a separate method for instances involving abuse of a dominance from 2016. In European Market, it is a settled tenet that the commitment mechanism pertains to neither admission of guilt by the party concerned nor any formal finding by the regulator on the alleged contravention, but it is primarily concentrated upon prospective resolution or way forward for the problems identified in the relevant market, which was reiterated in Commission v. Alrosa Co. Ltd. The process for reaching a settlement often entailed the commission presenting the parties with evidence sufficient to end the trial for breaches, after which the party was given the opportunity to present their statement of objections. Ultimately, the parties will either concede culpability and reach a settlement or contest liability and proceed to trial. Also, the adjudicating authority allows a reduction of 10% in fines applicable to the contravening party. \n\nUSA \n\nThe anti-trust regime in the United States underwent a change in the middle of the 1990s, with the new strategy being to prevent litigation and strengthen regulation. The adage \"time is money\" was more applicable than ever as businesses chose promises and settlements to protracted trials, even when the latter would have cost less or not resulted in a punishment at all if the agency failed to assemble sufficient evidence to prove a violation. Alongside, majority of the civil non-merger antitrust cases that the US antitrust watchdog, the US Federal Trade Commission, resolved were through negotiated settlements, referred to as \"commitments\", especially in cartel cases. Some pre-requisites for acceptance of a proposed settlement are, (a) existence of a cartel; (b) admission of guilt of contravention or alleged contravention; (c) cooperation of cartel’s participants; and (d) assurance by government not to levy further charges.  \n\nThe Way Forward\n\nThis novel development is anticipated to be the impetus for the the much-needed boost for India’s competition ecosystem. The inclusion of these measures under the amended law is a very positive development that shows how India's antitrust laws are becoming more advanced. The new provisions would make the entire legislation more wholesome and holistic in approach, as the earlier framework provided for leniency provision which provided for lesser penalty in case a member of cartel would come out in public to the regulator to report some anti-competitive practices, but was limited to only cartels. While these provisions will have a broader application on abuse of dominance and vertical agreements. Also, this mechanism is expected to allow the regulator to use its limited resources judiciously and settle antitrust complaints more quickly. After the framework has been put in place, the concerned parties will have the choice to address the alleged contraventions more quickly without going through drawn-out investigations and inquiries. Ultimately, these tools will provide a push towards India new economic motto “ease of doing business”.\n\nThe new approach has elicited conflicting reactions from the legal field; some welcomed it as a much need move to cater lacunas of existing statue which will allow for easing the work of the regulator vis-à-vis facilitating out-of-court settlement without necessitating protracted legal proceeding, while others point out that it is a half- hearted move by quoting certain shortcomings, such as (a) limited application of the regime to only vertical agreements and abuse of dominance, while leaving horizontal agreements and cartels outside its realm, (b) no provision of lesser penalty for the entities concerned as is the case in other jurisdictions, and (c) no provision of appeal against the orders of the regulator in these cases. Only time will reveal what the future holds for the new framework - either it turns out to be a promising provision or ends up being a misstep.\nCCICompetitionCompetition ActSettlement\nCompetition Law\n728 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Issuance of Green Bonds in India: Protecting the Environment at the Expense of Commercial Prudence?",
        "content": "Siddharth Sengupta, Tanay Dubey\nMay 11\n7 min read\nIssuance of Green Bonds in India: Protecting the Environment at the Expense of Commercial Prudence?\n[Siddharth and Tanay are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nIn November 2022, the Government of India granted approval for the Sovereign Green Bond Framework, which outlines the utilization of proceeds generated from the issuance of sovereign green bonds to fund projects that align with India's objectives for decarbonization. \n\nDespite this recent proactiveness shown by the government, due to the current state of India’s sustainable bond market, it is likely that it will fail to meet its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) target by 2030 which will require around USD 2.5 trillion of investment. The lack of green financing can be attributed mainly to three characteristics of the Indian green bond market. First, there is a lack of incentives for both the issuers and the investors. Second, in contrast to other markets, there is a dearth of diverse investment opportunities in India. Last, an effective legal framework to regulate the green bonds market is lacking.\n\nThis article assesses the measures taken by the Indian government to promote green financing, and highlights that the government’s efforts, at present, fall short in achieving the desired environmental targets. The article also delves into the commercial and legal challenges faced by the green bond market and proposes possible solutions to unlock its growth potential in India. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, the article characterizes green bonds into two types based on the issuer(s) - sovereign green bonds (SGrBs) issued by governments, and corporate green bonds (CGrBs) issued by companies to fund their environmentally sustainable projects.\n\nSovereign Green Bonds\n\nThe government, in the Union Budget 2022-23, unveiled its plans to issue SGrBs as part of its market borrowings to raise funds for green infrastructure, and the proceeds will be invested in public sector projects aimed at reducing the carbon emissions of the economy. The Green Bond Framework is in line with the globally recognized International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles which are a set of voluntary procedural guidelines that suggest for transparency and disclosure. \n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its maiden auction in January 2023 of SGrBs worth INR 8,000 crores attracted an oversubscription of more than four times. The second auction was as successful as the first one. Interestingly, the success of these auctions was despite the fact that the yields of these bonds were a few basis points lower than other government securities of the same tenure. This indicates the strong demand and potential for growth of the green bond market in India which has not been tapped yet.\n\nThe introduction of SGrBs in India is a welcome step, but it is insufficient to deal with the problem at hand for two reasons. First, SGrBs are limited to raising funds for public-sector green infrastructure projects, entirely neglecting the requirement for green financing in the private sector. Second, SGrBs solely will neither be able to fund India’s panchamrit targets nor meet the demands of the growing green bonds market. Thus, the promotion and success of CGrBs are quintessential to resolving these issues in green financing in India.\n\nCorporate Green Bonds in India: Opportunities and Obstacles\n\nAs of January 2023, Fitch Ratings reports that the green bonds market represented a mere 3.8% of the total CGrB market in the country. Also, India’s contribution to the global green bond market was $8.6 billion, which amounted to only a meagre 1.7% of the total issued green bonds. CGrBs in India have failed to reach its full potential in the Indian green bonds market because of two reasons. First, issuances are largely limited to the renewable energy sector, with a focus on solar projects. Second, sufficient incentives are neither provided to the issuer nor investor. Third, absence of an effective legal framework to regulate the CGrB market in particular. The detailed description of these problems is discussed further.\n\nLack of Incentives\n\nA major concern which makes CGrBs detrimental to investor interest is ‘greenium’ which is the yield difference resulting from the increased demand for a green bond that leads to a lower yield compared to a similar conventional bond. Relying solely on investors' environmental conservation willingness to accept lower yields will not be sustainable in the long term. Lower yields owing to lower rates of interest must be supplemented by tax incentives by the government. Despite there being such provision under Income Tax Act 1961 for possible tax exemptions, the same has not been made applicable for income generated out of green bond investments.\n\nIn addition, green bond investors are not permitted to contribute funds for issuance intended to support ongoing projects. Developers must therefore obtain domestic loans to finance their projects before refinancing them using bond revenues. Again, the issuer needs to have a price advantage for this, which may not always be the case, thus discouraging issuance. \n\nAs opposed to this, the United States, for example, has a structured incentive system under the Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) and Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) program that provides for three types of green bonds - Tax Credit Bonds, Direct Subsidy Bonds and Tax-Exempt Bonds, all of which provide distinct forms of monetary incentives for the investor, the issuer, or both.\n\nStructural Problems\n\nThere are also various structural problems with green bond market in India which are detrimental to the commercial interests of the issuers. Issuers have no pricing advantage as more than 80% of total issuance is done by renewable energy developer companies. A critical problem with wind and solar companies is the financial health of their main customers, the electricity distribution companies or discoms run by various states. Poor financial health of the customer leads to lower rating of the issuers, thus increasing the interest rates that can be charged by the investors, defeating the commercial viability of the issuance for the developers.\n\nAnother concern is that green bonds are denominated in rupees and primarily held by domestic banks, insurers, and the RBI. Meanwhile, a significant majority of issuers, up to 90%, prefer issuing green bonds in dollars. Thus, resulting in reduced issuer interest. Issuance in INR has also prevented foreign investment from flowing into the Indian green bond market.\n\nLack of Effective Legal Framework\n\nUntil very recently, India did not have an effective compliance framework in relation to issuance of CGrBs. However, in February 2023, SEBI released the “Revised Disclosure Requirements for Issuance and Listing of Green Debt Securities” that overhaul the required compliances and ensures transparency in relation to the use of proceeds. The requirements mandate publishing a statement on due diligence policies regarding the major negative implications of investment decisions. It also requires that specific information be disclosed by the issuers of these bonds in annual periodic reports which would be subject to examination by a third-party certifier/reviewer. However, rules regarding standardisation and certification of CGrBs are absent in India’s legal framework. Such standardization not only acts as a mark of credibility of the bond, but any attached benefits for compliance under the standard can incentivise issuance of green bonds with better specifications.\n\nIn the European Union, for example, there is an additional framework for issuance of green bonds called the European Green Bond Standard which gives the designation of European Green Bond (EuGrB) to those bonds that meet its specific requirements. The principal requirement is that the use of the proceeds of the EuGrB shall be allocated to the economic activities that are aligned with the EU taxonomy requirements. Additionally, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) compel issuers of EuGrBs subject to the requirement to prepare transition plans, which are audited plans for carbon emission reductions. Effectively, small and medium sized enterprises are not covered by the CSRD, therefore the requirement to create a transition plan only applies to large businesses. The benefit of complying with these stricter requirements and being characterised as a EuGrB is the notably lower issuance costs.\n\nPossible Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to the structural problems in the green bond market because of the poor health of the discoms, the government can help by changing the “guarantee mechanism,” that gives the creditor assurance that, in the event that the borrower fails to make payments (because its client, the discom, has not paid its dues), a third party will act as a “guarantor”. The more practical approach is to offer a “partial guarantee,” as blanket guarantees are very expensive, and thus rare. However, partial guarantee methods, such as those provided by government-owned NBFCs like IIFCL and IREDA, have not gained popularity in India because of the exorbitant fees they impose on developers. \n\nAdditionally, the introduction of a diverse range of incentivized green bonds in the Indian market, similar to that available in the well-established bond market in the US, would be a positive development. This would create a level playing field for green bonds to compete with other investment options, fostering increased investment and supporting the growth of the green bond market in India. The implementation of tax incentives under the Income Tax Act for income derived from green bond issuance would further be a highly favourable step by the government. This would encourage and incentivize businesses to invest in green bonds and thus environmentally responsible initiatives, promoting sustainable development and environmental conservation.\n\nIndia, not having any effective standardisation for CGrBs, should also adopt a similar incentivised standardisation as that of the European Green Bond Standard that can help first, the issuers to lower issuance costs; second, instil confidence in the investors about the prospective use of the bond proceeds; and third, help the government to meet its NDC goals as a consequence of issuance of healthier bonds in general due to the stricter compliance requirements in order to be certified under the standard. Also, India must adopt a similar mandate for transition plans as provided by the CSRD in the EU for the largest polluter industries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government and regulatory bodies in India have implemented multiple measures to promote green financing, including the introduction of SGrBs and continuous enhancements to the framework that regulates the green bond market. Despite these efforts, it must be acknowledged that they may not be adequate to achieve India's NDC targets. The lack of incentives for both issuers and investors, the dearth of diverse investment opportunities, and the absence of an effective legal framework are key hindrances to the growth of the green bond market in India. To unlock the full potential of India’s green bond market, there is a need for promotion of CGrBs by offering greater incentives such as tax exemptions, and addressing structural problems such as pricing disadvantages and financial health of issuers' customers. Apart from this, efforts to promote and regulate CGrBs through standardization and certification are crucial for India to achieve its environmental targets and contribute significantly to the global green bond market.\nNDCSovereign Green BondsRBISEBI\nCorporate Law\n485 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Carry Forward of Losses in M&A: Identifying Beneficial Holder Upon Shareholding Change in Group Cos",
        "content": "Khush Bhachawat\nMay 8\n7 min read\nCarry Forward of Losses in M&A: Identifying Beneficial Holder Upon Shareholding Change in Group Cos\n[Khush is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nSection 72 of the Income Tax Act 1961 (IT Act) provides assessees the right to carry forward their business losses for eight assessment years until the same can be set off against their business profits. Section 79 of the IT Act is an exception to this rule. It bars companies, in which the public is not substantially interested, from claiming a set-off unless persons who beneficially held shares corresponding to at least 51% voting power at the time of incurring the losses continue to hold shares corresponding to at least 51% voting power when the set-off is claimed. Section 79 is an anti-abuse provision that was introduced with the intent of preventing companies from acquiring loss-incurring companies for the sole purpose of reducing their tax liability. The threshold of 51% of voting power with the shareholder when the loss was incurred and when the set-off is claimed ensures that the assessee does not effect a change in shareholding solely for avoiding/reducing tax liability. \n\nUncertainty arises in cases of internal corporate reorganization where shares of a subsidiary company are transferred to another company in the same corporate group for business or commercial reasons, as to whether a set-off would be allowed in such cases. Consider a corporate group with the following structure: \n\n\n\nHere, A is the group's ultimate holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries, B and C. C, in turn, wholly owns D. A decides to undergo restructuring, and all shares of D held by C are transferred to B. To decide if Section 79 would apply to such a situation, it must be ascertained as to who is the beneficial holder of the shares of D. If C is the beneficial holder, then D cannot carry forward and set off its losses because C no longer holds a controlling voting power pursuant to the restructuring. However, if A is the beneficial holder by the virtue of being the ultimate holding company, then a set off can be claimed because even though the shareholding pattern has changed, A retains the controlling voting power when the set off is claimed.\n\nRecently, the Mumbai bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal) in Sodexo India Services Private Limited v. PCIT subscribed to the latter view and held that where beneficial shareholding of a company remains same and/or no set-off of losses have been claimed or allowed, Section 79 cannot be invoked. The applicability of Section 79 to transactions in such group structures has been a contested issue which stems from the contrary rulings of the Delhi and the Karnataka High Courts (HCs) in the cases of Yum Restaurants (India) Private Limited v. ITO (Yum Restaurants) and CIT v. AMCO Power Systems Limited (AMCO) respectively.\n\nAMCO v/s Yum Restaurants\n\nThe Karnataka HC in AMCO subscribed to the latter view, allowing the assessee to carry forward and offset its losses. Here, the shares of the assessee were wholly owned by a company named ABL. Subsequently, ABL transferred 45% shares to APIL, a wholly owned subsidiary of ABL. Thereafter, it transferred 49% out of the 55% remaining shares to a third party named TAFE. Resultantly, ABL owned only 6% shares in the assessee. The assessee filed its returns and claimed a set off for its business losses on the ground that ABL continued to hold 51% shares and voting power (45% indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, APIL, and 6% directly). The court accepted this argument and observed that even though ABL controlled only 6% of shares directly, it beneficially held the remaining 45% as it controlled APIL's entire voting power by being the ultimate holding company. A change in shareholding did not lead to a change in effective voting power, and therefore, Section 79 did not apply. \n\nHowever, the Delhi HC in Yum Restaurants came to the opposite conclusion. Here, the assessee belonged to the Yum Restaurants Group, whose parent company was Yum USA. Initially, Yum Asia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Yum USA, held 99.99% of the shares of the assessee. Pursuant to restructuring, the shares held by Yum Asia were transferred to Yum Singapore, another wholly owned subsidiary of Yum USA. The assessee claimed a set-off. The court rejected this claim and observed that Yum Asia and Yum Singapore were distinct entities. The corporate veil could not be pierced at the instance of the assessee on the grounds that since Yum USA was the ultimate holding company, it was the beneficial owner of the shares of the assessee. Beneficial ownership could not be presumed in such cases, especially in the absence of any arrangement/agreement laying this relationship.\n\nIt must be noted that the Delhi HC did not have the benefit of the judgment in AMCO when it was deciding Yum Restaurants as it was not placed on record before the court. Moreover, in Yum Restaurants, the court also overlooked an earlier decision of the same HC in CIT v. Select Holiday Resorts Private Limited, where the court allowed a set-off and as the assessee company was beneficially held (by way of an intermediary) by four persons of a family both on the day when the loss was incurred and when the set-off was claimed.\n\nThe contrary rulings by the Delhi and the Karnataka HCs have led different Tribunals to come to different conclusions. For instance, the Mumbai Tribunal has relied on AMCO in the cases of Wadhwa & Associates Realtors v. Assistant CIT (Wadhwa), Bechtel France SAS v. DCIT, DCIT v. Tril Roads, and BancTec TPS India (Private) Limited v. Principal Commissioner of Income-Tax. Similarly, the Ahmedabad Tribunal also relied on AMCO in CLP Power India v. DCIT (CLP Power). However, the Delhi and Mumbai Tribunals relied on Yum Restaurants in ACIT v. WSP consultants and Aramex India v. Deputy CIT, respectively, to deny the assessee the benefit of carry forward and set off.\n\nShareholding v/s Voting Power\n\nThe applicability of Section 79 hinges on who controls the voting power and not on the shareholding pattern. In CIT, Bombay v. Italindia Cotton Private Limited, the Supreme Court (SC) held that if the change in shareholding did not result in holding voting power of 51% or if it is established that post this change, the shares of a company carrying not less than 51% voting power in the assessee are beneficially held by the same person, it can be presumed that there is no change in control over the company. The ITAT in Wadhwa specifically took note of this distinction between 'voting power' and 'shareholding' and held that “if the intention of the legislature was to lay down the condition of shareholding, then there was no need to specify ‘voting power.’ This clearly indicates that shareholding is not the condition but exercise of ‘voting power’ is important for the purpose of section 79(a).” Therefore, one should look beyond the registered shareholder and inquire as to who controls the company's affairs and influences how voting rights are exercised. \n\nBeneficially ‘Owned’ v/s Beneficially ‘Held’\n\nThe term ‘voting power’ is qualified by the term ‘beneficially held.’ Therefore, the question remains whether a holding company can be called the beneficial holder of shares held by its downstream subsidiaries for taxation purposes. Most judgments on Section 79 (see, for instance, the Delhi HC’s ruling in CIT vs S Net Freight India Private Limited) use the terms ‘beneficial owner’ and ‘beneficial holder’ interchangeably. The author submits that although ‘beneficial holding’ is a derivative of ‘beneficial ownership,’ it operates in a distinct sphere. \n\nInternational taxation uses ‘beneficial ownership’ clauses to tackle treaty shopping. Upon satisfaction of beneficial ownership conditions, taxpayers can avail beneficial tax rates as available under international tax treaties. As per these treaties, a ‘beneficial owner’ is a person who has the right to use and enjoy the income earned by dividend, interest, royalties, and fee for technical services. The Commentary on OECD Model Tax Convention shows that beneficial ownership in international taxation is used in a very specific context for taxing certain specific incomes instead of beneficial ownership of assets. Regarding identifying the real owner of assets, the OECD does not provide any guidance and has left it open for the respective countries to provide a different and extensive meaning to the term or its variant terms. \n\nThe usage of ‘beneficially held’ instead of ‘beneficially owned’ in Section 79 is notable. In CLP Power, the ITAT observed that the word ‘held’ is more elastic than ‘owned.’ The use of 'beneficial' before ‘held’ requires the courts to go beyond the register of ownership, notwithstanding the separate and independent legal personality of the registered owner of shares. Yum Restaurants took a narrow understanding of ‘beneficially held’ and refused to lift the corporate veil. The author submits that the very wording of Section 79 indicates the authority must lift the veil of incorporation and look at the realities of the situation. In CIT v. Subhlaxmi Mills Limited, the Gujarat HC advocated for a 'substance over form' approach where the authorities must look beyond the façade of the corporate entity and see the real substance behind the transaction. \n\nSection 79 was enacted to check a very specific mischief, i.e., preventing companies from purchasing loss-making companies and thereby avoiding tax liability by claiming a set-off. In this light, the phrase ‘beneficially held by persons who beneficially held’ should include indirect control of voting rights through a chain of holding by the same group and the embargo of Section 79 should not be extended to companies undergoing internal corporate reorganization. \n\nFurther, the court in Yum Restaurants introduced a new condition of the existence of an arrangement/agreement of ‘beneficial holding’ between the parent and the subsidiary, which is not contemplated by Section 79. It is trite law that a taxing statute must be construed strictly, and nothing is to be read in or implied. The court’s view in Yum Restaurants contradicts this settled proposition of law. \n\nConclusion\n\nHolding structures are well recognized in corporate as well as tax laws. Although parent and subsidiary companies have distinct juristic personalities, the language and intent of Section 79 necessitate that the corporate veil is pierced by looking at the substance of the transaction over its form. A corporate group undergoing internal restructuring must not be brought under the dragnet of Section 79. Such companies should be allowed to carry forward and set off its losses notwithstanding the non-existence of material that indicates that the ultimate holding company is the beneficial holder of shares owned by its subsidiaries.\nBeneficial OwnershipCorporate VeilIncome-Tax Act\nTaxation Law\n402 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "Pump and Dump: How Social Media Enables Manipulation of India's Stock Market",
        "content": "Mohammad Kaif\nMay 7\n6 min read\nPump and Dump: How Social Media Enables Manipulation of India's Stock Market\n[Mohammad is a student at Campus Law Centre, Faculty of Law, University of Delhi.]\n\nThe lure of quick profits has always been a powerful force in the stock market, but some unscrupulous individuals take this to an extreme with pump and dump schemes. While Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), as the market regulator has implemented regulations such as the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations 2003 (PFUTP Regulations) and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR Regulations) to curb such practices and enhance disclosure, these manipulative practices have become a persistent problem that threatens the integrity of the stock market leaving unsuspecting investors with empty pockets. This article delves into the mechanisms of pump and dump schemes using social media platforms such as YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp, against the backdrop of the recent interim orders passed by SEBI in the case of Sharpline Broadcast Limited and Sadhna Broadcast Limited.\n\nPump and Dump Schemes\n\nAt the outset, let us understand the concept of pump and dump schemes. Pump and dump schemes are a type of illegal market manipulation that involves investors spreading false information to inflate the price of particular stocks. These schemes typically target small-cap and mid-cap stocks that are more susceptible to such tactics because of their lower trading volumes, lack of liquidity, limited analyst coverage, lower regulatory scrutiny, and higher volatility. The mechanics of the scheme involve purchasing a large number of shares at a discounted price, and then spreading rumors or misleading information to create excitement and optimism among the public, leading to an increase in demand resulting in a rise in the stock's price. Once the price reaches a high level, the perpetrators sell their shares, causing the price to plummet and leaving unsuspecting investors with huge financial losses.\n\nData from SEBI shows that the number of cases related to fraudulent and manipulative activities has increased in recent years. As per SEBI’s annual report of 2021-22, SEBI has taken up 38 new cases and completed 82 cases related to PFUTP Regulations violations in 2021-22. Moreover, adjudication proceedings were completed in 546 cases involving 2,369 entities during the year 2021-22, out of which nearly half were penalized for violation of PFUTP regulations.\n\nPC Jeweller and Parsvnath Developers were accused of engaging in pump and dump schemes in 2018. Both companies were accused of artificially inflating their stock prices by spreading false information and positive rumors. Investors who bought the stocks at inflated prices suffered significant financial losses. PC Jeweller's stock fell by 63%, wiping out INR 7,364.46 crore from its market valuation.\n\nUse of Social Media in Facilitating Pump and Dump\n It can be argued that the pump and dump schemes in the Indian stock market are rising largely due to the growing use of social media platforms like YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp. This provides a convenient way for perpetrators to spread false or misleading information about a particular stock to a broader audience, often consisting of retail investors who may lack the knowledge or resources to evaluate the accuracy of the information. This might cause significant losses for investors who rely on social media for investing advice but do not have access to trustworthy information sources. Additionally, the rapid dissemination of information on social media platforms can make it challenging for regulators like SEBI to detect and prevent such schemes. For example, YouTube channels with large followings frequently promote stocks by making exaggerated claims about the company's financials or prospects, often without disclosing their own interests. Similarly, Telegram and WhatsApp groups are used to share false information about a particular stock and create hype around it, leading to a surge in its price.\n\nSEBI's recent interim orders have drawn attention to the growing problem in India's securities market regarding the manipulation of stock prices through social media, particularly through the execution of pump and dump schemes. The orders, passed on 2 March 2023, relate to two cases involving Sharpline Broadcast Limited and Sadhna Broadcast Limited. In both cases, false and misleading videos were created on YouTube channels with large numbers of subscribers and viewership, promoting the stocks to unsuspecting investors for extraordinary profits. These videos were aided by paid advertising campaigns. In both cases, the entities offloaded their holdings at inflated prices once the unsuspecting investors entered the stock, leading to an increase in the price and trading volume of the stock. The Noticees in both orders violated Section 12A of SEBI Act 1992 and the PFUTP Regulations. The SEBI order has resulted in the imposition of penalties on Sadhna Broadcast and Sharpline Broadcast. In the case of Sadhna Broadcast, noticees must disgorge illegal gains of INR 42 crores and noticees in Sharpline Broadcast case must disgorge illegal gains of INR 12 crores as the penalty amount. Additionally, all noticees are barred from accessing capital markets until further notice.\n\nThe SEBI order raises several issues related to the integrity of the securities market and its participants. Firstly, the misuse of social media platforms for spreading false or misleading information about listed companies to manipulate their stock prices is illegal and unethical. The SEBI Act 1992 and the PFUTP Regulations prohibit such practices. Secondly, the role of front entities and synchronized trading in creating artificial demand and supply for the shares is a common modus operandi used by manipulators to control the stock price and make unlawful gains. SEBI has identified and penalized several such entities in the Sadhna Broadcast case, but it is important to prevent such practices in the future by strengthening surveillance and enforcement mechanisms. Lastly, the responsibility of promoters, shareholders, and KMPs in preventing such manipulative activities is crucial. SEBI has observed that some of the promoters and KMPs of both companies had sold their shares at inflated prices during the manipulative phase, indicating their complicity in the wrongdoing. It is important to hold such insiders accountable and impose strict penalties to deter others from engaging in similar activities. Overall, SEBI's actions serve as a warning to all market participants that any attempt to manipulate stock prices will result in severe consequences.\n\nWhy and How More Action Can be Taken by SEBI?\n\nSEBI's regulations have been successful in reducing the prevalence of pump and dump schemes in the Indian stock market. Yet, there is still opportunity to prevent such schemes in the future, the following suggestions can be considered:\n\nStricter regulations on social media platforms\n\nSocial media platforms should have protocols in place to detect and eliminate false or misleading information that can potentially manipulate the prices of securities. These platforms should be held accountable for allowing the circulation of such content.\n\nEnhancing surveillance\n\nThe stock exchanges should strengthen their market surveillance system to identify and track any unusual price movements and trading patterns. Regulators should also increase their cooperation with other regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies to detect and deter such schemes.\n\nStringent enforcement of regulations\n\nThe regulators should take strict action against those who violate the rules and regulations related to the securities market. This includes imposing heavy penalties, prosecuting the offenders, and freezing their assets to prevent them from enjoying the illegal gains.\n\nInvestor education\n\nRetail investors should be educated on the dangers of pump and dump schemes and how to identify such practices. This can include workshops, seminars, and online resources provided by regulators and other market participants.\n\nIncrease the penalties for non-compliance with disclosure requirements\n\nCurrently, fines for non-compliance with disclosure requirements as per the LODR Regulations, may not be a significant deterrent for companies engaging in fraudulent activities. Strengthening penalties could serve as a more effective deterrent to fraudulent practices.\n\nSEBI and market participants can work to build a more open and equitable securities market that benefits investors, issuers, and intermediaries by putting these recommendations into practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, pump and dump schemes are a significant threat to the Indian stock market, particularly for retail investors who lack knowledge and experience. SEBI has taken measures to curb such practices, including the implementation of strict disclosure requirements for listed companies and the prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practices. However, social media platforms have made it challenging to detect and prevent these schemes, and perpetrators are increasingly using them to manipulate the market. To safeguard their investments, investors should exercise caution when investing in unfamiliar companies or those with sudden price fluctuations and be wary of unsolicited investment advice or tips from unknown sources. To strengthen its control over manipulative trade activities, SEBI should focus on increasing investor awareness and education and using more advanced technological tools to detect and prevent market manipulations. By being vigilant and informed, investors can minimize their exposure to pump and dump schemes and protect their investments.\nPump and DumpSecuritiesSEBISocial Media\nCorporate Law\n402 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "SEBI's Oversight Gap: Fin-influencers and the Need for Regulation",
        "content": "Uddhav Vaishnaw, Prakhar Khandal\nMay 2\n6 min read\nSEBI's Oversight Gap: Fin-influencers and the Need for Regulation\n[Uddhav and Prakhar are students at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nThe rise of digital media and access to information on the internet has resulted in the emergence of financial influencers (fin-influencers), who provide information and advice on financial topics such as investing, cryptocurrency, and stock market trading. Using social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, they post videos in various languages. Fin-influencers aim to simplify the policies, legalities, and practices of stock market investing for their followers. They have multiple income streams, including collaborations, partnerships, and online advertisements, which can generate significant earnings. The rise of fin-influencers was powered by the cryptocurrency market surge in 2017 and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the stock market to reach unprecedented heights and appeal to more novice investors. New investor registrations in India hit a record one and a half million in June 2021, more than double the six hundred thousand in June 2020. The share of retail investors in the cash market turnover jumped from 33 % in FY16 to 45 % in FY20, with the same level recorded in FY21, according to data from the National Stock Exchange. The benchmark Standard & Poor's Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex touched a record high of 52,641.53 points by the mid of 2021. However, all this was exposed when the golden bull run ended. Many transgressions were reported, including the Vauld crisis, whereby multiple fin-influencers were allegedly compensated handsomely (in lakhs) to endorse their crypto products. Furthermore, there were allegations of companies paying these influencers to influence stock prices through their advice. This demonstrates that these fin-influencers manipulated investors by taking  advantage of the aforementioned developments in the market, which necessitates us to delve further into the world of fin-influencers, analysing the regulations that may be drawn, to see what really lies behind this cloaked veil.\n\nSEBI Regulations for Investment Advisers and Research Analysts: Limitations and Challenges\n\nThe existing regulations in India mandate registration as research analysts (RAs) or investment advisers (IAs) to provide advisory services for listed securities in compliance with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations. However, these framework regulations may not be suitable to address unique challenges posed by fin-influencers, leading to complications explored in greater detail below.\n\nResearch analyst\n\nRegulation 7 of the SEBI Research Analysts Regulations 2014 (SEBI RA Regulations) outlines the minimum qualifications and certification requirements (issued by the National Institute of Securities Markets) for individuals registered as RAs, those employed as RAs, and partners engaged in preparing and publishing research reports or analyses. \n\nDespite possessing knowledge and a substantial following, fin-influencers are not necessarily equipped with the required certification and training to get registered with SEBI as RAs. Thus, according to SEBI RA Regulations, they are not authorized to provide investment advice or research reports and may not necessarily be classified as RAs.\n\nInvestment adviser\n\nThe SEBI Investment Advisers Regulations 2013 (SEBI IA Regulations), under the proviso to Regulation 2(l), state that \"investment advice given through a newspaper, a magazine, or any electronic, broadcasting, or telecommunications medium that is widely available to the public shall not be considered investment advice for these regulations.\"\n\nFin-influencers disseminate their financial advice through social media, an electronic medium widely available to the public. Therefore, their advice cannot be considered investment advice under the SEBI IA Regulations. Thus, fin-influencers cannot be regulated under the ambit of an IA.\n\nDesigning Regulatory Framework for Fin-influencers\n\nSEBI's current regulatory framework is not equipped to handle the challenges posed by fin-influencers. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to note that several authorities have taken steps to tackle this issue. The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) in India has issued guidelines, and Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) have also implemented certain regulations to regulate fin-influencers. To establish effective regulations for fin-influencers, SEBI can evaluate the effectiveness of Australian regulations in particular, as well as the guidance provided by the DCA in India and the English authorities. This article aims to provide valuable insights to help develop new regulations based on global standards that could effectively regulate fin-influencers in India.\n\nThe DCA guidelines \n\nFin-influencers are frequently paid to promote products or services, which is why their advice is often considered an advertisement. The DCA in India has issued “Endorsement Know-Hows” guidelines to ensure transparency in the financial relationship between fin-influencers and companies. These guidelines require fin-influencers to disclose any \"material\" interests, such as gifts, equity, awards, and discounts, when endorsing products or services. Failure to do so may result in legal action, including a ban on endorsements. However, the guidelines do not address the accuracy or quality of the advice given by fin-influencers. Given that fin-influencers hold considerable sway over the public's investment  choices, enforcing robust regulations for transparency and investor protection  is crucial.  To  address this concern, a specialized body like SEBI should be entrusted with  the regulation of fin-Influencers to safeguard the integrity of capital  markets, as per Section 11 of the SEBI Act 1992 (SEBI Act). SEBI has the jurisdiction to regulate intermediaries and can incorporate the DCA's guidelines into its regulatory framework to create a more comprehensive and effective regulatory regime for fin-influencers.\n\nGlobal Regulations for Fin-influencers\n\nSEBI can draw inspiration from other countries with a relatively successful and robust framework for designing a framework in this regard.\n\nUK\n\nThe UK's “CAP Code” outlines rules for legality, honesty, accuracy, and transparency in marketing communications, including social media marketing. The Advertising Standards Authority's Influencer's Guide and the UK Government's Social Media Endorsements Guide provide further guidance to influencers on how to clearly disclose sponsored content to their followers. Recently, the UK Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning to fin-influencers who promote financial products, advising them to be clear about their obligations when advertising on social media channels to avoid breaking the law,  which can also result in a criminal investigation if necessary.      \n\nAustralia \n\nAustralia provides us with more comprehensive regulations than the UK. Therefore, we shall focus on Australia for the SEBI to take cognisance in designing a framework for the fin-influencers.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has published “Information Sheet 269” to provide guidance to fin-influencers and Australian Financial Service (AFS) licensees who may authorize fin-influencers to provide financial services under their AFS license. In Australia, there are primarily two obligations for influencers: licensing and good practices, and disclosure.\n\nUnder Australian law, carrying on a financial services business without an AFS license is illegal, as specified in the Corporations Act 2001. The law imposes severe penalties for non-compliance, including fines in millions of dollars and imprisonment for up to five years. Regulatory Guide 36 (RG 36) provides guidelines for obtaining an AFS license. According to RG 36.57 and RG 36.58, individuals and organisations offering financial services must hold an AFS license unless an exemption under Section 911A(2) (or regulations made for the purposes of that provision) applies. For instance, a representative of a licensee can provide financial services without an AFS license. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a violation of the law.\n\nRegulatory Guide 234 (RG 234) provides guidance on advertising financial products and services, including credit, to avoid breaching consumer protection and financial services laws, including the Design and Distribution Obligations, which took effect in October 2021. It is essential to use caution when disclosing returns, features, benefits, and risks (RG 234.33–RG 234.46), providing warnings, disclaimers, qualifications, and fine print (RG 234.47–RG 234.53), and avoiding certain terms and phrases (RG 234.91–RG 234.104).\n\nRegulatory Guide 244 is a regulatory guide for financial advisors to provide quality information and advice about financial products to retail clients. It covers information, general advice, and scaled advice. Factual information about a financial product's features or terms and conditions can be provided, but presenting it in a way that implies a recommendation to invest or not invest in the product could violate the law. For instance, a financial influencer's video titled \"Buy and hold these 3 stocks as they'll perform well\" likely constitutes giving financial product advice. \n\nFin-influencers arranging financial product transactions should provide truthful and accurate statements supported by evidence and disclose potential risks. For instance, claiming that holding shares for a long period is like depositing funds in a bank account without mentioning risks is misleading.\n\nSEBI's Approach: Invoking Relevant Provisions\n\nHaving understood the regulatory framework by taking inputs from diverse authorities that oversee financial influencers, SEBI must decisively adopt and enforce these corresponding regulations with similar standards to establish its own regulatory framework to maintain the credibility of financial advice disseminated by influencers in India.\n\nTo achieve this, SEBI can classify fin-influencers as a new category under the definition of an intermediary as outlined in Regulation 2(g) of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations 2008, thereby bringing them under SEBI's regulatory purview. To do so, SEBI can use its authority under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, which empowers it to make regulations for the protection of investors and the securities market. By developing a new set of guidelines, including licensing, registration, minimum qualifications, ethical standards, disclosure requirements, and penalties for non-compliance, SEBI can ensure that only qualified and experienced individuals or entities provide financial advice to the public, enhancing the quality of the advice and protecting investors' interests. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nAs the stock market scales unprecedented heights and novice investors flood the scene, the rise of \"fin-influencers\" in India has become a pervasive trend. However, the lack of a clear regulatory framework governing these influential voices is concerning. Despite India's consistent efforts to safeguard investors from fraudulent practices, the unique challenges posed by fin-influencers are yet to be fully addressed. In this rapidly changing financial landscape, India must adapt and evolve its regulatory approach to ensure that the aspirations of its investors continue to thrive. Therefore, SEBI must evaluate current regulations and establish a robust framework to monitor fin-influencers, ensuring an improved regime for safeguarding investors.\nFinfluencersFin-InfluencersSEBIResearch AnalystInvestment Advisor\nCorporate Law\n987 views\n18 likes.

        "content": "Shobhit Shukla\nApr 30\n6 min read\nTraversing Hub and Spoke Cartels through an Inconsistent Information Exchange Framework\n[Shobhit is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nThe President on 12 April 2023 gave her assent to pass the Competition (Amendment) Act 2023 (Amendment Act). One of the amendments in the Amendment Act widens the scope of ‘cartels’ by bringing hub and spoke cartels within the ambit of competition scrutiny. This is in line with the landmark Samir Agrawal v Competition Commission of India (Samir Agarwal) case, wherein a matter regarding hub and spoke cartels came up for consideration before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for the first time. \n\nIn a hub and spoke cartel, there are exchanges of information from the spokes to the hub, which is then used by other spokes; hence, an effective information exchange mechanism is necessary to create a consistent framework for hub and spoke cartels. While the Amendment Act and various judgments acknowledge the need for a solid framework for hub and spoke cartels, lack of precedents, in addition to a conflicting approach on information exchanges, pose an issue which highlight the interpretive struggles of the court. Hence, this article seeks to not only appreciate the notable strides made by the Amendment Act but also highlight the considerable scope for improvement for the judiciary, by discussing some case laws and foreign perspectives related to such aspects. The article also reviews the effect of ‘information exchange’ with respect to a hub and spoke cartel, and concludes with a recommendation for a clearer regime in this aspect in accordance with the objectives of the Amendment Act.\n\nTracing the Gradual Limitation of the Scope of Information Exchange\n\nIn Anticompetitive Conduct in the Dry-Cell Batteries Market in India, the CCI held that even a unilateral exchange of information, can implicate the participants. The CCI in Builders Association held that an exchange of information which can remove uncertainties between participants must be regarded as pursuing an anti-competitive object, and therefore, mere exchange of commercially sensitive information is anti-competitive. However, in Re: Sugar Mills, the CCI seemed to dilute this stance and create exceptions, where it held that only active exchange is prohibited under the Competition Act 2002 (Act) and that “exchange of information on issues of operations in the matter of rendering of services in the market, is not uncommon.” In Re: Alleged Cartelisation for Increasing Pulse Prices in India, it held that in a situation where there exists a buyer–seller relationship between companies, any exchange of information needs to be analysed keeping in mind the multi-faceted relation. Against this backdrop, sporadic communications between enterprises exchanging information, which is already available in public domain, cannot be construed as ant-competitive. Further, in Film & Television Producers Guild of India, it was held that trade associations could be used as platforms for the exchange and mere exchange of information is not sufficient to prove anti-competitive conduct; it should also enable the conspirators to act upon the common scheme. To carry this uncertainty further, the CCI in the Flashlights case concluded that “even though there is evidence of exchange of information, there is hardly any evidence to show that such activities resulted in determining the prices. Therefore, it cannot be established that the agreement depicted was acted upon.: The CCI in Bearings, however, adopted another approach, different from its precedents. The fact that parties met to decide the price revisions was considered sufficient by CCI to establish a violation. CCI found that the information exchanged compromised the parties’ independence. While the CCI acknowledged that it was possible for the cartel to not have led to a collusive outcome in the market, it did not consider ‘implementation’ of the arrangement necessary for establishing a cartel violation.\n\nCCI’s varied approaches in these decisions bring out some important issues. Once the exchange of anti-competitive information among competitors is established, (i) is there a requirement to show that the agreement was acted upon by the parties?; and (ii) if so, can CCI assume ‘implementation’ and find parties to have contravened the Act, basis the information exchange alone? In sum, CCI must adopt a consistent approach which would aid enterprises in having legal certainty and be act as the basic framework for a solid hub and spoke regime.\n\nLaying the Framework for an Unassailable Hub and Spoke Regime\n\nInitially in Fx Enterprise Solutions India Private Limited v. Hyundai Motor India Limited, Hyundai was alleged to have facilitated a hub-and-spoke cartel among its dealers. However, CCI while finding a prima-facie case of collusion, did not address the issue in its entirety. Finally, in Samir Agrawal, CCI decided that the use of cab aggregator platforms by individual drivers with similar algorithms for price discovery does not amount to a hub and spoke cartel. CCI held that “a hub and spoke arrangement generally requires the spokes to use a hub for exchange of sensitive information. For a cartel to operate as a hub and spoke, there needs to be an existence of collusion.” The matter went on appeal wherein the court held that since aggregators work on price algorithms and the drivers do not act in the capacity of employees, they are not acting as a hub and spoke. The author argues that the courts have taken a narrow view of hub and spoke cartels, due to a distortion in the fundamental understanding because of the varied stances taken by CCI regarding information exchanges. Although hub and spoke cartels operating with different price algorithms appear to be free, similar price algorithms owing to factors like purchasing the same algorithm from the same company may end up in a concerted action. Since wide arrays of sectors are similarly placed in terms of their operations, an inapt precedent like the one discussed above must be revisited to accommodate future instances. Since the post-COVID-19 era is likely to be marked by newer business models and an increased exchange of information through internet platforms, such a view only restricts the ability of the CCI to look beyond and poses a challenge in applying the available jurisprudence in practice. \n\nAn exploration of other jurisdictions’ approaches on similar issues offers a bird’s eye view of the widely accepted practices and help determine methods suited to India. As in line with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited v Commission of the European Communities, the UK follows the ‘concerted practice’ model, which is “a form of coordination of information between undertakings which, without having reached the stage where an agreement has concluded, knowingly substitutes practical cooperation between them”. In the Replica Football Kit case and the Toys case, the UK courts established a criterion for the finding of a concerted practice. According to this criterion, the future pricing intentions need to be linked to each other by circumstances that allow the conclusion that a concerted action has taken place, and named it as the “state of mind” test.\n\nIn VM Remonts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) highlighted it was unnecessary for a spoke to have complete information of anti-competitive conduct. Instead, the mere awareness could be sufficient to distinguish a hub-and-spoke cartel. In Eturas case, ECJ held that since the travel agencies had knowledge and did not attempt to distance themselves, they could be held liable for indulging in a hub-and-spoke cartel. While, it is presumed that information exchanged between parties is used to determine their market conduct, if an entity can however display the lack of a cause-effect relationship, it can be acquitted. To charge the hub, the commission of acts was necessary. \n\nThe US has followed an ‘inference standard’ in cases such as Interstate Circuit, Toys “R” Us, and the Parke, Davis & Co. Such a standard is based on establishing a ‘rim’ around the unconnected spokes. Due to the lack of direct communication under such agreements, they give due credence to circumstantial evidence and the presence of ‘plus factors’ to conclude the formation of a hub and spoke cartel. These plus factors are simply additional factors that the authorities investigate to reach a conclusion and include factors such as the type of information shared, the effects of sharing, and the market structure. \n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to understand that hub and spoke cartel may go unrecognized if not detected with a consistent approach. Therefore, it becomes imperative that a broader view is taken while considering various business structures. A cue may be taken from the US and the UK since their largely successful framework may be tested in the Indian context. No matter what approach is taken by the CCI in deciding upcoming cartel matters, it remains a question of academic debate as to where the line for anti-competitive information exchanges separating it from positive exchanges lies in competition law. The author believes that regardless of where the line lies, it begins with a more consistent approach. Therefore, it is essential for India to have greater clarity in its information exchange jurisprudence in order to ensure robust enforcement against hub and spoke cartels as envisioned in the Amendment Act.\nCompetitionCompetition ActHub and SpokeCCICartel\nCompetition Law\n429 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Deal Value Threshold: A Critique of India’s Latest Competition Regime",
        "content": "Aditi Gupta\nApr 30\n5 min read\nDeal Value Threshold: A Critique of India’s Latest Competition Regime\n[Aditi is a student at National Law University Delhi.]\n\nA recent development in the realm of competition law is the proposed changes to the deal value threshold under the Competition Amendment Bill 2023 (2023 Bill). Recently, the Rajya Sabha approved the bill in April 2023 which is aimed at modernizing the two-decade-old anti-trust law to align with changes in the economy. It seeks to enhance competition and promote economic growth, and has been the subject of much debate and speculation among industry experts and stakeholders alike. The proposed amendments are poised to have far-reaching implications for businesses operating within the jurisdiction, and as such, understanding their potential impact is essential.\n\nDe Minimis Exemption\n\nThe recent approval of multiple high-value acquisitions of firms in the digital realm without merger control examination has prompted antitrust regulators worldwide to review their regulatory regimes. Although the purchases of Uber Eats and Blinkit by Zomato for USD 350 million and USD 570 million, respectively, and WhatsApp by Facebook for USD 19 billion in 2014 raised concerns about competition, they were not reported to the Competition Commission of India (CCI). In all these cases, the target was under the exemption limit called as de minimis exemption. Certain transactions that fall below a certain threshold are excluded from notification to the competition authority under the de minimis exemption. The concept of deal value threshold was introduced as per the recommendations of the Report of the Competition Law Committee (2019) (Committee). It was done so as to cover those combinations also which though fall within the ambit of de minimis exemption, but they have an appreciable adverse effect on the competition. The transactions worth INR 20 billion or more will require the permission of the CCI provided that the party has “substantial business operations” in India.\n\nAnalysing the Competition Law Committee Report 2019\n\nThe Committee was informed by the CCI that, at a stakeholder consultation on \"digital markets and competition challenges\" held by the CCI on 24 July 2018, industry leaders had acknowledged the urgent need for ex-ante review of acquisitions in the digital arena. The Committee highlighted how the majority of these acquisitions in digital marketplaces generate value from either the target's data or some form of business innovation. In such acquisitions, the target may not have a huge asset base and may be offering products/services that are either free or generate insignificant turnover. The business models of such companies are such that they initially focus on increasing consumer base. In light of this, the Committee debated whether the asset- and turnover-based thresholds for notice of combinations specified in Section 5 of the Competition Act were enough. \n\nThe Committee highlighted that unlike many other countries, the CCI lacks the authority to evaluate transactions unless the notification thresholds are met, even though their potential for affecting competition is clear. This is because the CCI lacks any residual authority to evaluate non-notifiable transactions under the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act). Even Section 20(1) is not sufficient to cover such transactions.\n\nForeign Jurisprudence\n\nIn countries like Brazil and Ireland, the competition regulators have used residuary powers to evaluate transactions when thresholds were not satisfied. Such powers have been exercised in US as well where the merger notification threshold is based on the size of transaction test. Certain other countries rather than relying on residuary powers have more concretely dealt with this lacuna by the introduction of a deal-value threshold for merger notification. \n\nGermany and Austria have incorporated such threshold for notification. After an extensive consultation with the concerned stakeholders, Section 35 was included to the German Act against Restraints of Competition. This clause establishes a USD 400 million deal value barrier as the minimum for merger notice. If a purchase costs more than EUR 400 million and the target company has \"significant activities\" in Germany, subject to certain turnover-based threshold requirements, such a deal is subject to the merger control examination of the German antitrust authority. Similarly, in Austria, a provision was added to the law which provides that if a transaction is valued more than EUR 200 million and the entity is “active to a large extent in the domestic market”, the merger notification requirement has to be satisfied.\n\nNew Changes: The Looming Uncertainty\n\nThere was an enforcement gap regarding the ability of the CCI to review transactions in digital markets to test their anti-competitiveness under the earlier merger control regime. The CCI did not have any residuary power of review like Brazil or the US, referral mechanism like the EU, share of supply test like the UK or a deal value threshold like Germany and Austria.\n\nThe deal value threshold in its current format also has a lot of interpretative holes. Parliament has to carefully consider whether ex-ante regulation of the digital economy without sufficient factual support is putting the cart before the horse. If implemented, the deal value threshold needs greater clarification of its components to give investors and businesses more clarity and prevent false positives from being unnecessarily notified. \n\nSubstantial business operations \n\nThe definition of deal value threshold is unknown as of now (e.g., the ambit of which entity would constitute the \"enterprise\" and of \"substantial business operations\" is unclear). This will be particularly confusing in cases wherein an Indian company has acquired another Indian company. The 2023 Bill seeks to clarify that substantial business operations are to be looked at from the viewpoint of the target entity. This would be against the Ease of Doing Business. Adopting CCI regulations that clarify the components of \"substantial business operations\", as recommended by the Committee, would be beneficial in this regard. It is essential that the transactions covered by the deal value threshold have a strong and evident nexus to India and that there is a genuine possibility that an appreciable adverse effect on competition will be caused as a result of the transaction for the deal value threshold to be effective. One such strategy may be to define the term \"substantial business operations\" in a way that takes into account the enterprise's local nexus. \n\nValue of transaction \n\nSince the Rajya Sabha has approved the amendments, the ball to swiftly define what constitutes the “value of transaction” lies in the CCI’s court. The questions include whether non-monetary considerations can be included or not. The method of calculation must be specified in the Competition Act itself rather than being left to delegated legislation. These modifications have always been meant to be dynamic. There is no denying that the regulator will need to be flexible and have the authority to step in when needed. The intervention should have little to no impact on routine transactional activity and little to no influence on the market or consumers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the CCI adopts the approach similar to that of Germany and Austria, global transactions, regardless of their effect on Indian markets, will be subject to merger review if one party has a presence in India. In fact, the European Commission criticised the implementation of a deal value criterion in its Competition Policy for the Digital Age Report 2019, arguing that regulators will catch \"too many\" transactions that meet the requirements, increasing the administrative burden. When creating a deal-value threshold, the following factors may need to be taken into account. This includes (a) determination of the method of accounting for variations in the value of the shares provided they form a part of the transaction, (b) computing a deal value threshold in complex situations (such as when earn outs and deferred consideration provisions are based on performance during a time period that may be years after closing), (c) varying deal value based on the date of calculation of value, and (d) establishing a local nexus test in accordance with international standards, in order to prevent capturing situations that would not genuinely have an impact on competition in India. Thus, while the government has certainly tried to plug the legislative gap, there are more elements that the authorities need to look into.\nCompetitionCompetition ActAAECDe MinimisDeal Value Threshold\nCompetition Law\n956 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Multi-Sided Markets: Practical Indicia Approach in Delineation of Relevant Market",
        "content": "Ishita Mishra\nApr 29\n8 min read\nMulti-Sided Markets: Practical Indicia Approach in Delineation of Relevant Market\n[Ishita is a student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.]\n\nThe advent of multi-sided markets has introduced a new dimension to the delineation of the relevant market before computing anti-competitive behavior. The digital realm, in particular, has come under the scrutiny of competition authorities in numerous jurisdictions, with the European Commission being at the forefront of the notion of taking regulatory action against big tech companies. Recently, it has passed the Digital Markets Act 2022 (DMA) and Digital Services Act 2022 (DSA), which shall focus on such ‘gatekeepers’ creating entry barriers in the digital market. Last introduced in 1977, it has drafted a revised market definition notice, aiming to update the definition of relevant markets to account for the evolving nature of the digital marketplace, which has taken on a multi-sided format. Notably, the digital market in India has also emerged as a focal point for scrutiny, emphasizing the need for legislation similar to the DMA and DSA.  \n\nThe article assesses the distinctive characteristics of multi-sided markets, becoming crucial for the delineation of the relevant market including network effects, substitutability assessment, the applicability of quantitative assessments, and characteristics of the platform, drawing from various jurisdictions. It proposes the application of the practical indicia approach as the most suitable strategy in such a context. The article aims to contribute to the existing discourse on adapting competition laws to the evolving digital landscape. \n\nMulti-Sided Markets and Network Effects \n\nThe multi-sided market model consists of two distinct groups of platform users on opposite ends, who engage with each other through the platform. Two-sided platforms represent the simplest form of multi-sided markets. For example, a hotel booking platform deals with a guest looking for accommodation on one side and a hotelier on the other, with the platform facilitating interaction and transaction between them. \n\nNetwork effects become a significant aspect to appreciate when comprehending the dichotomy of multi-sided markets. There can be both direct and indirect network effects. Only multi-sided markets can achieve indirect network effects. Under direct network effects, the value of the product/ service fluctuates with the fluctuation in the users of the product/ service. In indirect network effects, there are two groups on opposite sides, and the value of the product/ service fluctuates based on the interaction between the two groups. For example, if buyers increase in a multi-sided market platform, there is an increase in price to be paid for a product/ service by the sellers on the platform.  \n\nThe issue in delineating multi-sided markets arise due to the often-asymmetrical value distribution under such platforms. For instance, Facebook charges its advertisers but not its users. The imbalance leads to the question of whether a platform-level approach should be followed, with both sides encompassing one single market, or both should be looked at and assessed separately. \n\nDefining the relevant market can influence the assessment of dominance. Thus, with both sides encompassing a single market can expand the relevant market for the platform, having a reduced market share. This can lead it to refute the claim of it being dominant in the relevant market. On the other side, defining the market from one single side can result in a narrow definition which may lead to the platform having a larger market share, affecting its assessment of dominance. Hence, the delineation of the relevant market becomes a complex yet significant factor to evaluate before the assessment of dominance under multi-sided markets. \n\nThe issue was highlighted under Amex v. Ohio, wherein the merchant and the user were concluded to encompass one single market. The differentiation was based on platform typology, being a transaction-based platform. Both direct and indirect network effects were appreciated and incorporated under such delineation. It was based on the research on platform typology providing that under transaction platforms, a transaction occurs only when both sides agree to use the same platform, giving rise to benefits to both sides and strong indirect network effects. Thus, either the merchant shall be present on both sides or it will not be present at all.  It differentiates the platform from being either a transaction or non-transaction platform, recommending a separate market approach for non-transaction-based platforms as enabling a transaction is not always an integral part of their service. Moreover, in cases wherein the impact of indirect network effects is strong, the research suggests a platform-level approach, and vice-versa. \n\nSubstitutability Assessment \n\nUnder such cases, competition authorities have often followed the substitutability assessment, assessing substitutability possibilities for user groups from alternative sources compared to the product/ service offered by the platform. The economic model was appreciated in the Czech Booking.com case, being distinct from other booking platforms. Here, substitution possibilities from both sides were considered. Following such a dual approach, two separate markets were identified, one for guests seeking accommodation and accommodation providers. Both were identified as end customers. \n\nDifferent approaches have been followed by different jurisdictions while acknowledging and accepting the duality or the existence of such multi-sided markets. In Austria, the demand-substitutability has been analyzed from just the customers of the service, in a case concerning the financial sector. The market was defined to encompass both sides. The German National Competition Authority (NCA) suggests defining separate markets for each side, except a matching platform. It looks into additional factors, such as platform characteristics and demand homogeneity on either side.  \n\nThe Indian competition authority, Competition Commission of India (CCI) has only recently acknowledged the existence of such multi-sided markets in Vijay Gopal v. Big Tree Entertainment Private Limited (BookMyShow). However, an inconsistent practice has been followed without supplying reasons for looking at one side of the market. In FHRAI v. MakeMyTrip, the market was delineated from the perspective of hoteliers without sufficient reasoning. India is still in the early stages of assessing and appreciating multi-sided markets. \n\nApplicability of SSNIP Test \n\nThere are divided opinions on the applicability of the small but significant and non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP) test in multi-sided markets, especially in terms of zero-price markets. The applicability of the SSNIP test under a multi-sided market becomes difficult because of the pricing structure of such markets.\n\nOn the applicability of the test on the two separate sides of the market, the test can be challenging to implement. Although, it can be a valuable tool for analyzing the sides’ interdependence. However, there are risks of the market being too narrowly defined if the interdependence of the sides is not adequately accounted for. Hence, the SSNIP test has been rarely applied because it is inaccurate and not an appropriate tool for such forms of market. The inaccuracy and gaps in the applicability of the SSNIP test under such circumstances were analyzed in the 2019 Congressional Report in the US. \n\nThe United Kingdom’s 2021 CMA Merger Assessment Guidelines do not refer to the SSNIP test in the context of multi-sided markets. Instead, they rely on specific guidelines for assessing the relevant market under such cases. First, it is analyzed as to how the competition works and whether the competitive aspect functions only on one side of the platform. If the platform operators focus on improving aspects of the offer on only one side, both sides of the platform may be analyzed separately. However, under cases wherein the competitive aspect affects both sides of the platform, such as technological efficiency, both markets are to be analyzed together. Second, wherein the competitive conditions, such as alternatives available, are different for both sides of the platform, both sides may be analyzed separately. Last, network effects have also been taken into account. Under cases wherein indirect network effects are strong, the assessment is undertaken for both sides together. \n\nOther Quantitative Assessments \n\nSmall but significant non-transitory decrease in quality test (SSNDQ), or modifying the SSNIP into a cost-oriented test i.e., small but significant and non-transitory increase in costs (SSNIC) come into play when analyzing such qualitative aspects in the absence of quantitative data. Such qualitative data can be quantifiable to a certain degree, such as customer attention on advertisements categorized under ‘attention costs.’ Thus, under such a case, an assessment can be undertaken of how consumers might shift to other platform substitutes when there is an increase in advertisements. \n\nHowever, the assessment also has setbacks, such as not considering customer preferences. Thus, the results can be highly subjective. Even if there is an increase in the number of advertisements and the customers can detect quality degradation in the service, they still might stay on the platform due to their platform bias. Hence, even though quantifiable, the parameters can be highly subjective, falling out of the purview of just a monetary expense. It is suggested against the application of such tests in the market. \n\nCharacteristics of Platform \n\nCompetition authorities have started relying on a more characteristic-based approach or a qualitative assessment in light of the complexities of the applicability of the SSNIP test. However, it is advisable to look at both assessments together and not over-rely on such qualitative measures.   \n\nRegulators may engage in the qualitative assessment of the functions provided by digital services in assessing the scope of such zero-price markets. Such inquiries can further be supplemented by empirical evidence on products that consumers believe to be 'reasonably interchangeable' with the product at issue. In the Czech CHAPS case, the market assessment included an assessment of the nature of the platform, the products offered, and hypothetical competitors without considering the SSNIP test. The 2019 Congressional Report elucidates upon the inapplicability of the SSNIP test in zero-price technology markets, not being suitable for the peculiarities of such markets. It also suggests a more characteristic-based approach, pointing towards the US Horizontal Merger Guidelines 2010 where quality is referred to in the application of the hypothetical monopolist test. \n\nIn the German NCA decision in CTS Eventim, the NCA assessed the peculiar characteristics of the platform through surveys to the relevant market of ticketing system platforms that did not charge booking platforms but charged event organizers. They were held to be operating in the same market as there was a close connection between the zero-price side of the platform and its for-payment side. Thus, interdependence was explicitly recognized in the core analysis. \n\nIn Brown Shoe v. United States (Brown Shoe), the practical indicia approach was adopted wherein the product’s practical indicia or its peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, etc., were looked into. Courts employing the practical indicia approach adopt a qualitative approach in assessing the scope of certain multi-sided markets. Courts rely on ‘industry recognition’ of the scope of relevant markets. The same can be corporate conduct, internal strategy documents, and expert testimony for delineation of the relevant market. While the approach may have its difficulties such as defects in methodology and wording of the survey, there has been greater importance drawn to such an approach especially, in zero-price markets, enabling a greater understanding of such market format. \n\nWay Forward\n\nIt is imperative to comprehensively evaluate multi-sided markets and demarcate the market after appreciating its dichotomy and the interdependency of the two sides. However, there is a lack of uniformity in adopting consistent practices across various jurisdictions. This complexity is further compounded in cases where zero-price markets are present in such market structures. The existing literature suggests that quantitative tools may not be suitable for assessing substitutability but can still be utilized to a limited extent. The most suitable approach in the context of CTS Eventim and Brown Shoe is to adopt a more characteristic approach, examining the practical indicia. The CCI, having only recently recognized the existence of multi-sided markets, nonetheless lacks in undertaking a comprehensive investigation to appreciate its unique characteristics for a fair delineation of the relevant market before computing anti-competitive behavior. Reliance should be placed on qualitative tools as a complement to quantitative tools in the form of surveys of competitors, customers, and industry experts, striking a balance between the two approaches to yield optimal results.\nCCICompetition LawMulti-Sided MarketsRelevant Market\nCompetition Law\n148 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Enforcement of Award against the Shareholders: The Delhi High Court's Dilution of the Corporate Veil",
        "content": "Shourya Mitra, Shruti Mishra\nApr 27\n6 min read\nEnforcement of Award against the Shareholders: The Delhi High Court's Dilution of the Corporate Veil\n[Shourya is a student at Jindal Global Law School, and Shruti is a student at Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies.]\n\nEnsuing the dismissal of DMRC’s application to set aside the arbitral award against them in the matter of DAMEPL v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the Delhi High Court vide its order dated 17 March 2023 directed the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Government of Delhi to take appropriate steps to enable DMRC to meet the obligations arising out of the award. A single-judge bench of Justice Yashwant Varma found both governmental entities to be principal shareholders of the DMRC and further held that public policy and justice demand the lifting of the corporate veil to hold the principal shareholders responsible. \n\nUpon non-satisfactory enforcement of the award, DAMEPL filed the present execution petition against DMRC and its shareholders to obtain the award monies from the shareholders. The ruling, however, pierces the corporate veil in a manner such that it may not be in consonance with precedent. The corporate veil is a fictional veil separating the company and its owners, and the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil provides that the two are to be treated as separate legal entities such that the duties and liabilities of one cannot be imposed on the other, barring certain exceptional circumstances. The emerging principles of law severely dilute the concept of a separate legal entity. The authors would like to shed light on the possible problems in five points.\n\nInjustice: A Complete Sweep \n\nTraditionally, the standards of lifting the veil included ‘sham’, ‘fraud’, ‘public interest/policy’. However, the court in the present case broadened the scope of the doctrine, modifying these well-established standards. The court held that the two governmental entities were promoters of DMRC, and it was merely their “alter ego”, and thus the veil ought to be pierced. This was based on the fact that the two promoters by virtue of their powers over DMRC board, their equity and debt contributions, and capital investments, exercised complete control over the affairs of the DMRC. Therefore, they were liable to be “recognised in law as being in absolute control and the directing mind.”\n\nThis alter ego test invoked by the court envisages that the company is a mere instrumentality of its principal shareholders. It has two requirements — that (i) the corporation has such unity with its parents that their separateness has ceased; and that (ii) the facts are such that the treatment of entities as a separate entity would “sanction a fraud” or “promote injustice”.\n It is the second prong of this test that the court relied heavily upon while holding that the circumstances in the present case would result in “injustice”, and hence warranted the lifting of the veil. In doing so, the court stretched the boundaries of the doctrine to any situation where there is injustice in not doing so. However, this may be far too sweeping of an element, as what may qualify as “injustice” has been left completely open. This muddles the somewhat solidified jurisprudence on when the corporate veil can be lifted and also takes away certainty in law as to the limits of a “separate legal personality.”\n While the court chose not to restrict the ambit of injustice in its own words, it relied on a decision of a US Court, wherein it was specified that injustice must be some wrong beyond the “creditors’ mere inability to collect from the corporate debtor”. Interestingly, however, if this decision were to be applied to the factual matrix at hand, it would preclude it from the ambit of “injustice,” since the dispute at hand involved piercing the veil for collection of a lump sum from the promoters instead of the debtor itself. However, since no explicit clarification has been provided about the objective standard for what constitutes as an “injustice”, its limit remains to be seen.\n\nControlling and Directing Mind: A Ghost from the Past\n\nThe qualifiers of “absolute control and the directing mind” referred to by the court are reflective of the doctrine of identification, which was invoked by the Bombay High Court against Mukesh Ambani in the case of Reliance Industries Limited v. H Block. In that case, the court proceeded to pierce the veil since Mukesh Ambani was “the controlling mind and will” of his company. The judges observed that as per the doctrine of identification, a company is “identified with such key personnel through whom it works.” \n\nThese “key personnel” were described to be the alter ego of the company and their actions were deemed to be the actions of the company itself. However, this doctrine was subsequently rejected by the Hon’ble Apex Court because it was typically applicable only in criminal and tortious liability cases. Therefore, the standard of absolute control and directing mind relied on by the Delhi High Court in the present ruling may have been a re-opening of closed doors and a step in the wrong direction.\n\nPublic Policy: A Misconceived Ground?\n\nThe court also referred to “public policy” as grounds for lifting the veil, since it would allow DMRC to meet its obligations with respect to the award. The court relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of UP v. Renusagar Power Co (Renusagar), where it held that the doctrine of corporate veil must be allowed to expand and that the veil can be lifted when public interest requires it. In that case, the entities Renusagar and Hindalco were so inextricably linked that Renusagar had no separate and independent existence apart from Hindalco and was formed for personal use. Further, the state authorities themselves acknowledged the entities cumulatively in their communication. However, DMRC, in this case, is not a company that has been incorporated for the personal use of its two shareholders, nor is there any evidence of any reference to DMRC and its two shareholders in a cumulative fashion during the arbitration proceedings. Therefore, the facts do not reflect such link between DMRC and its shareholders as was the case in Renusagar. \n\nThe principle of lifting the veil was also invoked in public interest in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Gotan Limestone Khanij Udyog (Private) Limited. In that case, the corporate entity had been used to conceal a fraudulent transaction involving the transfer of a mining lease to a third party without statutory consent. The doctrine was thus applied to prevent circumvention of statutory provisions. The factual matrix of the present case is different, owing to the fact that DMRC had not been used by its shareholders to conceal any fraudulent transaction. Therefore, using public policy as a ground for lifting the veil here would require more deliberation and clarity from the court.\n Dilution of Separate Legal Personality of PSUs and the Government \n The court here held that the two “sovereign governments” could not shirk from their liability to abide by binding judgements, decrees and awards. Relying on circumstances like the governmental entities being principal shareholders of the DMRC, their exercise of power over the DMRC by virtue of their position on its board, and their capital infusion and extension of debts to the DMRC, it held that the DMRC was under the absolute control of these shareholders. \n The problem with such an application of facts is that a significant number of PSUs exist wherein a government has significant shareholding, sometimes exceeding 90%. The PSUs will therefore be dependent on the approval of their shareholders, including the government, to carry on their operations, whether by way of board meetings or through general meetings. The government will also exercise power derived from the concerned statute. Such powers may also be contained in the charter of the PSU. In either case, the problem that arises from the Delhi High Court’s application of the doctrine is that in many PSUs where the government has a controlling shareholding, the doctrine of separate legal personalities will stand diluted, and all liabilities of the PSU can be directly pinned on the government wherever there is “injustice.”\n General Dilution of the Doctrine of Separate Legal Personality \n The standard of “absolute control” outlined by the High Court can potentially be stretched to include nearly every corporate body having a concentrated shareholding pattern, which is a commonality in Indian entities. In such scenarios, the promoter/shareholder, by virtue of their shareholding, exercises de facto control over the board, as the appointment and removal of directors is entirely dependent on these controlling shareholders. \n\nTherefore, the question that arises is if a principal shareholder exercising de facto control over the board also engages in extension of debt and capital to the company, will they be considered to be in “absolute control” and be the “directing mind” of the company such that the obligations of the company can be pinned on them in the event of an “injustice”.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Delhi High Court’s ruling exhaustively analyses the jurisprudence on the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil and rightly comes to the conclusion that the doctrine should be left to develop and evolve. However, the emerging legal principles out of it may be too sweeping and may disbalance the doctrine such that it may invalidate the existence of a separate legal personality. Subjective qualifiers like “injustice” and “inequitable circumstances” require objective tests, clarifications and restrictions so as the prevent arbitrariness. Further, the scope and domain of public interest and public policy as relied on by the court remain ambiguous and prone to erroneous discretion. It raises the question of whether public interest lies in the functioning of the Metro Rail or in the enforcement of the arbitral award at the cost of such functioning. While this determination may be beyond the scope of this piece, it does remain a valid concern.\nCompanies ActCorporate VeilDMRCAlter Ego\nCorporate Law\n334 views\n35 likes.

        "title": "Reconsideration of an Approved Resolution Plan by CoC: A Conundrum?",
        "content": "Kumar Shubham, Divyansh Bhardwaj\nApr 26\n6 min read\nReconsideration of an Approved Resolution Plan by CoC: A Conundrum?\n[Kumar and Divyansh are students at National Law University Odisha.]\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) was enacted with an aim of providing a speedy resolution to the creditors and the corporate debtor (CD). The corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) under the IBC is a time-bound process which aims for asset value maximization and revival of the CD. \n\nEvery CIRP needs consideration of a resolution plan, the nature of which is a rehabilitation or a restructuring plan proposed by the resolution applicants for the debt restructuring of the CD, and to continue the same as a going concern. Once a plan is submitted by the applicants, the committee of creditors (CoC) assesses the feasibility and viability of such plans, post which upon agreement on one of such proposed plans through requisite majority under IBC, is declared as the successful resolution plan. This approved plan is then presented in front of the Adjudicating Authority (AA) for its consideration.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the CoC has decided to review or reconsider its decision of approving a resolution plan, while it was pending the approval of the AA. The jurisprudence on this topic has been subject to conflicting opinions by Indian courts, resulting in a conundrum while hampering the future resolution plans and possessing a threat to the objectives of IBC. The authors in this article have analyzed the power of CoC to reconsider or review its approval under its commercial wisdom in a case where the successful plan is pending the approval of AA, in light of IBC provisions and judicial pronouncements.\n\nConflicting Judicial Pronouncements\n\nRecently, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Delhi in Hem Singh Bharana v. M/s Pawan Doot Estate Private Limited and Others (Hem Singh Bharana Case) held that once the CoC has approved a resolution plan, such decision is binding upon them and the approval cannot be subjected to any reconsideration. The tribunal, while deciding the case, relied on the landmark judgment of Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited and Another (Ebix Singpore Case), wherein the Supreme Court of India opined that a resolution plan cannot be withdrawn while it is pending the approval of the AA, since the approval of CoC culminates into a binding agreement between the creditors, the resolution applicant, and the CD. Similarly, in a previous instance, the Supreme Court in Maharashtra Seamless Limited (MSL) v. Padmanabhan Venkatesh had denied the withdrawal of an approved resolution plan, while it was pending approval of the AA. \n\nThe settled precedences restrict withdrawal of approved plans during their pendency before AA, basing themselves on the rationale that an approved plan becomes contractually binding in nature, the terms of which are agreed by both creditors as well as the applicants. Therefore, the NCLAT, Delhi, in the Hem Singh Bharana Case, has relied itself on the nature of an approved resolution plan, i.e. a binding agreement, which cannot be allowed to be reconsidered by the CoC upon their prior approval. \n\nHowever, through this judgment, the NCLAT Delhi has contradicted its previous reasoning in Bank of Maharashtra v. Videocon Industries (Videocon Industries Case), where the CoC was allowed to reconsider its approval, while the plan was pending the approval of the AA, where the approved plan observed a 95% haircut. The reconsideration was allowed upon the reasoning that the haircut proposed in the approved plan was commercially unviable in nature, and the CoC was duty bound to do the same, since the interest of public exchequer was involved.\n\nMoreover, the decision in Videocon Industries Case continues to be in effect which creates a prima facie conundrum in the evolved jurisprudence aiming to settle the dilemma over the reconsideration of an approved resolution plan by the CoC. \n\nTo obtain a clearer picture of the conundrum, the Ebix Singapore Case discussed three phases where a resolution plan may be withdrawn by the applicant, which are, firstly, before the approval by CoC, secondly, when the plan has been approved by CoC and is pending consideration of the AA, and lastly, when the plan has been approved by the AA. In the present case, the conundrum discussed lies in the second stage. It is pertinent to note that the Ebix Singapore case only discussed the prospects of withdrawal of the approved resolution plans in the second phase by the successful resolution applicant, and not the CoC. However, the question existing is that whether the CoC can be restrained from reconsidering the resolution plan on the same rationale.\n\nCritical Analysis\n\nWith due respect to the observations of NCLAT, it is submitted that the decision of the tribunal in Hem Singh Bharana Case does not find a congruence with the law enshrined under IBC, and defies the objective of maximizing the value of the assets of the CD. \n\nIBC empowers the CoC to take all the financial decisions of the CD during the CIRP. After a resolution plan is submitted by an applicant, the CoC is under an obligation to assess the “viability and feasibility” of the plan, post which it may accept or reject the plan by the requisite percentage of votes, i.e., 66%. The commercial wisdom of the CoC is observed by the culmination of the proceedings into a legally binding agreement between the parties. However, if the courts have observed the resolution plan to be of a contractual nature, it becomes upon the will of the parties to either terminate or continue such agreement.\n\nIt is a settled position that the AA can return the plan for reconsideration to the CoC on a request made by the CoC under its commercial wisdom. Once the plan has been approved by the CoC, the statutory mandate of the AA under Section 31(1) is to ascertain that the plan obliges the requirements of subsections (2) and (4) of Section 30. Furthermore, while considering the resolution plan, if the AA feels that there is some reason to alter the plan, or where the relevant parameters are not addressed, they have a right to return the resolution plan back to the CoC for their consideration. A resolution plan attains finality and becomes binding only after the approval by the AA, under Section 31 of IBC. Therefore, it can be derived that the code does provides for reconsideration of the resolution plan by the CoC. Such reconsideration is based upon the commercial wisdom, and if the same can be allowed upon findings of AA, in a situation where the CoC has enough information or options available, reconsideration of the plan shall only aid to the objective of speedy resolution of the process i.e. reducing the time of such consideration by AA upon any alteration or findings.\n\nMoreover, it has been observed that an approved resolution plan can be returned for reconsideration to the CoC, in case of changed circumstances. Perhaps the Videocon Industries Case has rightly observed that where the CoC at a later stage finds that the public exchequer is to bear an unprecedented haircut in a large fund employment, then the proposal can be remanded back to the CoC in larger public interest. Considering the same ratio, in case where the CoC receives a better settlement agreement offering them a lesser haircut, it shall constitute as changed circumstances and must be allowed in the light of larger public interest.\n\nThe consent of CoC is paramount in IBC, and that it has the sole right to decide the terms of the resolution plan. The exercise of commercial wisdom by the CoC is also nonjusticiable and cannot be subjected to any judicial review. Furthermore, modification of payment is a commercial aspect and falls within the scope of commercial wisdom of CoC. Additionally, it has been held that a body that has the power to make a decision, also has the power to add to, amend, vary or rescind the same decision.\n\nIt is also contended that an approved plan does not become contractually binding. A contract is binding on the contracting parties who consent to the terms enumerated in the same. However, a resolution plan becomes binding not only on the creditors and the resolution applicant, but also on the employees and other creditors of the CD. Hence it ceases to be a contract since it involves entities who are not party to the contract. Therefore, the CoC is well within its right to reconsider or review its approval, if such reconsideration is in better interest of the CD.\n\nLastly, another aspect to the contractual nature of the resolution plan is the free consent. For  example, where a plan so pending before the AA offers an 80% haircut while during such proceedings a settlement agreement is proposed in front of the AA offering a 50% haircut. In such a situation, the disallowing of reconsideration of the settlement agreement would not only violate the commercial wisdom of the CoC, but the same would be against the free consent of the CoC amounting to imposition of contract by the court against the principles of both the IBC as well as the contract law.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough CIRP is a time bound process, the CD should not be allowed to suffer in the garb of the same. The major objective of IBC is the maximization and revitalization of the CD. In the present fluctuating market, it is very much possible that an approved resolution plan becomes unfeasible due to changed circumstance. In such case, the CoC must be allowed to reconsider its approval since it will only benefit the corporate debtor. Indeed, the CoC needs to be more careful while analyzing the future prospects of the resolution plans before voting on the same, but the benefit of commercial uncertainty must be given to the creditors. Moreover, since the IBC landscape in India is still evolving, the conflicting stance of the courts on this jurisprudence may harm the interests of the creditors as well as the corporate debtors.  \nIBCCommittee of CreditorsAdjudicating AuthorityResolution Plan\nInsolvency Law\n717 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "The Conundrum of Confusopoly",
        "content": "Rahul Taneja, Ishaan Saluja\nApr 22\n5 min read\nThe Conundrum of Confusopoly\n[Rahul and Ishaan are students at Hidayatullah National Law University.]\n\nConfusopoly refers to a situation wherein the dominant entity spreads misleading information about the competitors in the relevant market in an attempt to mislead the consumers about the quality of the latter’s product. According to multiple reports, confusopoly has a softening effect on competition in the market as it reduces the price competition among entities in the market. Accordingly, creating a confusopoly has been recognized as legitimate grounds for bringing an action under Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act) in the recent case of Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association v. MakeMyTrip Go. Although the judgment dealt with various aspects including but not limited to dominance in the digital market, parity clauses, and predatory pricing. This article will be dealing mainly with the aspects of misrepresentation and its relation to the abuse of dominance under Section 4 of the Competition Act. \n\nBackground\n\nThe Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association (FHRAI) had filed information under Section 19(1)(a) of the Competition Act against MakeMyTrip and Goibibo (collectively MMT-GO) and Oravel Stays Private Limited (OYO Hotels). The information alleged that there was a concocted arrangement between these entities to delist the hotels that did not follow the arbitrary conditions imposed by these entities.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nIn the present case, MMTGo, which holds a 63% share of the Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) market, had imposed a parity clause in the agreement with the hotel partners. The parity clause refers to a stipulation wherein the agency restricts the seller from offering better or similar rates to its competitors thus restricting the price competition in the market. MMTGo’s parity clause restricted the hotels from offering better rates to other OTAs. Further, the agreement stated that not complying with the parity clause will lead to the delisting of the hotels from the MMTGo platform. \n\nSeveral hotels had raised complaints about the agreement and were consequently delisted for non-compliance of the same. However, even after being delisted from the platform, these hotels were not removed from the platform and were shown as sold out on the same. The hotels complained that this improper delisting had dissuaded the consumers from looking at the availability on other OTAs and consequently lead to the lesser booking of their inventory. Further, the Director General (DG) concluded that the misrepresentation by MMTGo left little possibility for the hotels to sell their rooms through other platforms which had an adverse impact on the business of these hotels. It also restricted the right to a fair choice on the part of the consumer by creating an information asymmetry in the market vis-à-vis the inventory of these hotels. \n\nRelying on the arguments brought in by the association and the DG report, the CCI observed that a dominant entity engaging in misrepresentation has an adverse effect on competition in the market as it reduces the competition of budget hotels on different OTAs and unfairly restricts the number of room bookings for the concerned hotel. This entire scenario has been referred to in this blog as a confusopoly.\n\nGlobal Jurisprudence\n\nSpreading misleading information about the competitors and their negative effects on the competition in the market has been a leading cause of concern amongst various antitrust regulators. Such a problem takes up an exacerbated effect when it happens in the digital market which is characterized by fast-flowing information and the short attention span of the consumer. To counter the problems associated with unfair practices by large entities in the online market, the European Commission recently came out with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which aims to prohibit unfair practices done by gatekeepers, it will come into force from May 2023. Gatekeepers are defined under the law as entities that have held a strong and durable economic position in the market enabling them to act as a reliable intermediary between a large number of users and businesses. The legislation puts a special responsibility upon the gatekeepers to act in a fair manner to protect the spirit of competition in the market. \n\nThe gatekeeper theory was recognized in India via Matrimony v. Google case. The special responsibility entails a list of non-exhaustive measures that will be considered prohibited under the law. Although engaging in misrepresentation about the competitors has not been explicitly recognized under the law, a case can still be brought considering the objectives and scope of the same. Further, in Roche/Novartis, the dominant entity spread misleading information about the quality of the competitors’ products to hospitals, distributors, and retailers. The court took cognizance of the same and recognized that such practice has an adverse effect on the market of the competitor and initiated abuse investigations against Roche Enterprises. \n\nFinal Order\n\nThe CCI agreed with the submissions brought in by FHRAI and the DG report and convicted MMTGo on two major grounds:\n\nThat MMTGo is a dominant player in the relevant market because of which the consumers rely heavily on the information that is presented on the platform. Thus, the consumer was dissuaded from searching availability of rooms on alternative platforms because of the act of misrepresentation by MMTGo.\nThe act was exclusionary as well as exploitative for budget hotels that compete in the relevant market.\n\nIn arriving at the final order, the CCI seems to have ignored decisional practice and established precedents that it arrived at in previous cases. In Meru Travel Solutions Private Limited v. ANI Technologies Private Limited and Others, the CCI held that because of the presence of various competitors in the market providing similar technological services and functions, the consumer was not restricted in his choices and could easily switch between the services provided by the aggregators. Further, as per various reports, the effect of the confusion in the minds of the consumer is limited to a great extent when there is a similarity among the entities providing the services in the market, this is because the consumer often uses these services interchangeably and can verify the information provided by these entities without much work. The OTA market, which was delineated as the relevant market, is characterized by multiple platforms providing similar services of online intermediation. The effect of the confusion created by MMTGo was restricted because of the presence of the same.\n\nFurther, MMTGo contended that the hotels were delisted due to a technical glitch and that it had no intention to misrepresent their inventory. This was further corroborated by the fact that the hotels were misrepresented only on Make My Trip and not Goibibo, both of which are owned by the same entity. Moreover, the hotels that complained about the inaccurate representation were appropriately delisted from the platform. However, these arguments were not appropriately dealt with and were ignored by CCI in the final order.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe order of the CCI in the FHRAI case with regard to the issue of misrepresentation sets a dangerous precedent that may act as a hindrance to the growth and innovation in novice sectors. The role of the CCI is to maintain the competition in the market and not to act as an arbiter of contractual issues between the parties, adopting such a strategy will lead to unrelated matters being disguised as competition law disputes coming under the ambit of the regulator. The CCI has acted in ignorance of pertinent market realities and the arguments brought forth by the parties. Further, setting a troublesome precedent on an issue that will most likely be exacerbated with the growth of the internet and non-price competition among digital entities will cause more harm than good to the consumers as well as to the entities operating in these sectors.\nCompetition ActMMTOTADigital Market\nCompetition Law\n262 views\n13 likes.

        "title": "Organic Dominance vis-à-vis Essential Facility: Analyzing Exclusionary Effects by Big Data Firms",
        "content": "Devarshi M Trivedi\nApr 22\n5 min read\nOrganic Dominance vis-à-vis Essential Facility: Analyzing Exclusionary Effects by Big Data Firms\n[Devarshi is a student at Institute of Law, Nirma University.]\n\nWith the advent of the rejuvenated digital-market-centered Competition (Amendment) Bill 2023 passed in Lok Sabha on 29 March 2023, the ambiguity surrounding jurisdictional competency vis-à-vis digital market regulation now stands explicit. The renewed stance is evident from the judgement in Google LLC v. Competition Commission of India by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) upholding the penalty of INR 1,388 crores in the case of Umar Javeed and Others v. Google LLC and Another imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The NCLAT’s approach crystallises the stance of the adjudicatory bodies to treat big data firms abusing their dominant position by restricting competition through data-oriented entry barriers. \n\nThe initial perusal commenced when the crackdown on WhatsApp’s renewed privacy policy by the CCI and the subsequent ratification by the Supreme Court of India highlighted a significant transition in the era of big data firms acquiring voluminous data at the behest of privacy. However, apart from the privacy domain being the moot point in the controversy, the market tactic of WhatsApp accumulating humongous data and circulating to its parent company Meta Platforms and sister concern Instagram, in a way that centralized data sharing patterns and subsequently created entry barriers for potential new competitors. These firms have acquired organic dominance by “essentializing” their cardinal facility that assumes a pervasive market significance. In light of the same, let us broadly about the concept of “essential facility” and its implications. \n\nWhat is the Doctrine of Essential Facility? \n\nThe phenomenon of 'essential facility' can be termed as a situation of ingredient-oriented economic advantage. The firms occupying the essential facilities have either naturally acquired monopoly or man-made innovation has catered to their stronghold in the upstream market. In one of the first European Commission (EC) decisions on 21 December 1993 in the case of Sea Containers v. Stena Sealink, the term 'essential facilities' was deliberated as instances wherein the firms refrain/restrict the circulation of the facility beyond their market presence thereby dwindling the supply chain.\n\nBig Data vis-à-vis Essentiality \n\nThe dominance of the existing data-driven firms should be accredited to the user base that subscribes to the platform. Since antitrust authorities have absolved themselves from the unregulated market, the big data firms have nurtured strategies to keep the competition restricted and limit data interoperability. This results in smaller or uprising competitors devoid of access to the quality of the data available as against the market position of Google Amazon Facebook Apple.\n\nData replicability \n\nData is a non-rival component without a price dimension. As a result, it is easy for different data controllers to attain requisite access and perform subsequent processing. Since the web giants have polished their user base from inception, the daily traffic has allowed them to accumulate and reproduce data at a zero-marginal cost. It allows them to consolidate and personalize consumer preferences without extra additional expenses. This creates a hurdle for potential newcomers to replicate the data possessed by the web giants at a nascent stage. The new firms cannot have direct market access to the data as it is directly dependent on consumer engagement on the aforementioned web giants. Therefore, data replication indirectly subsumes the essentiality of consumer data as a factor to bolster digital market presence. \n\nData substitutability \n\nA resource’s essentiality is determined by its close substitute and its viability. It is significant to note that data substitutability should be analyzed relatively as against the absolute terms i.e. determining the intended use of the data. Therefore, it becomes essential to obtain data at a nascent stage from established close substitutes capable of circulating the requisite data. For example, a man has created an AI software capable of generating automated job availability in requisite locations. To bolster his data replication, he approaches the locational data platform Google Maps and LinkedIn for data access. Now, since these entities possess voluminous data, they may “essentialize” the records and prevent them from being ubiquitous and relish the competitive advantage derived therefrom. The resources do have close substitutes, but the behaviour of the undertakings in terms of information stronghold makes big data essential. As long as the data possessed does not have viable alternatives to bring the competitor to an equal footing, data shall remain an “essential” component.\n\nBig Data vis-à-vis Exclusionary Effects\n\nIf yes, how?\n\nThe web giants have time and again claimed the first-mover advantage when it comes to innovation or entering alien businesses. The cardinal reason behind this leveraging of market power is the self-preferencing of the firm’s own products and services. As a result, it sends policy shocks in the downstream markets and increases the demand for data access from close competitors/new entrants due to the substitutable/replicable nature of the data. On 17 September 2007, in the case of Microsoft Corporation v. Commission of the European Communities, the EC elicited the competitive advantage possessed by Microsoft by refusing the data interoperability with non-Microsoft dealers. It was observed by the commission that dominant firms possessing essential facility should regulate self-preferencing to refrain from the practice of creating exclusionary effects.\n\nIn furtherance to the same, the European Commission, on 14 May 2008 in the case of the Tom Tom/Tele Atlas acquisition, observed that acquiring a key input increases one’s market presence. It provides the firms leverage to reproduce and process humongous data for maximum market penetration. That said, in the above case, the commission discarded the effects test as the entities lacked economic incentives. However, it is significant to note that an input attaining sole ownership in a vertical integration may create an artificial price surge in the upstream market wherein potential competitors/rivals who had data access may find it difficult to access data in a new commercial arrangement. This can result in the refusal to market access by restricting the supply when the same product has potential consumer demand and the competing firm intends to carry out innovation investment in future. Further, the exclusionary effects can also arise in cases of web data giants entering into exclusive contracts to foreclose the attempt of rival firms to access the similar data.\n\nIf no, why? \n\nSince the big data firms have cemented their position using sustained innovation investment, their apprehension to refuse data facility cannot be termed outright implausible. Just as allowing data as an input will foster competitiveness in the market amongst rivals, refusing access will devise a path for innovation. Further, refusing data access will pave the way for rival firms to be incentivized to develop close substitutes to dominant firms and disrupt innovation. As previously discussed, the non-rivalrous nature of datasets deems it as a conducive component available in the market. It is ambiguous on the aspect of 'essential facility' only on account of the quality of the dataset. For example, when Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, it got access to the quality of data that was insurmountable. However, its alternatives such as iMessage (Apple), LinkedIn (Microsoft), and Skype (Microsoft) were able to generate substantial consumer traffic and accumulate quality datasets through constant processing.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the aforementioned discussion, the idea of big data firms relishing organic dominance stems from the data manifestation derived from the digital interaction between different actors, thereby catering to the systematic interpretation of consumer preferences within the digital market. Despite no commercial impairment, the potential new competitors are unable to dissect the preferences and expend a lot of capital to study market demand, hence falling back on the aspect of creating a profound innovation-oriented layout. The CCI is yet to adjudicate more broadly on the idea of data being an 'essential facility', which may broadly explore and validate the contours of whether big data firms engage in exclusionary acts by essentializing the data.\nBig DataEssential FacilityExclusionary EffectsAntitrustCCI\nCompetition Law\n161 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Analysing the Impact of the Widening of Angel Tax on Indian Economy and Start-up Ecosystem",
        "content": "Venkata Kartheek Vegesana\nApr 14\n4 min read\nAnalysing the Impact of the Widening of Angel Tax on Indian Economy and Start-up Ecosystem\n[Kartheek is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nOn 1 February 2023, the Finance Minister of India introduced the budget for the Financial Year 2023-24, which outlined various governmental policies and financial allocations for different sectors. The budget also included the Finance Bill 2023, which proposed a range of changes with consequential effects on the Indian economy and its financial health. These changes included numerous direct and indirect tax proposals and amendments.\n\nThis article aims to primarily analyse the impact of the widened Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (IT Act). This tax, commonly referred to as angel tax, is levied on a certain type of investors and has created hurdles in the start-up ecosystem. The tax attempts to tax share premium by non-residents and also determines the cost of the shares (fair market value). Additionally, there is a form of dual regulation, as foreign investment regulations, including the Foreign Exchange and Management Act 1999 (FEMA), usually guide the valuation of shares issued to non-residents.\n\nImpact of Angel Tax\n\nThe Parliament amended Section 56 of the IT Act through Clause 32 of the Finance Bill 2023. Section 56(2)(viib) aims to regulate share premium of a company by taxing the capital generated by the company through the sale of shares at a price higher than the market price (fair market value). To better understand this section, we need to examine its objective. This tax is usually referred to ‘angel tax’. \n\nObjective of Section 56(2)(viib)\n\nThe intended purpose of Section 56(2)(viib) is to deter the generation and use of unaccounted money by a company through subscription of shares of a closely held company at a value which is higher than the fair market value (determined through Section 11UA). To lay down this section in bare terms, its purpose is to prevent the circulation of unaccounted money as share premium. This was introduced in 2012, after a trend of events where the assessing body observed companies masking unaccounted money as share premium. \n\nExisting Provision\n\nCurrently, this form of tax on share premium is only applicable on residents. The income generated from accumulating such share premiums is to be considered as income from other sources under Section 56, and is to be assessed and taxed accordingly. \n\nAmendment\n\nThe amendment removes the residential qualification for the applicability of this provision. The expectation of a range of investors and companies was that the government would completely get rid of this form of tax, as it was posing unrequired burden on share premiums which, in the traditional form of understanding, was something which the investor would pay over and above the value of share, based on the company’s performance and qualities. The government completely turned that expectation on its head and expanded the application of such tax to non-residents as well. \n\nDual Regulation\n\nThe problem with the amendment is that it leads to a situation of dual regulation, as there are already regulations in place under the FEMA for the valuation of shares issued to non-residents. These regulations include Regulations 6 and 8 of the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations 2017, which provide for the valuation of shares as per internationally accepted methodologies. These regulations also establish the fair market value (in India) as the floor price for any sale of shares to non-residents.\n\nThe taxpayers face an inherent challenge as they have to satisfy both sets of requirements. This is due to the fact that the valuation system is not aligned: the value of shares is determined by the fair market value (as discussed under Section 11UA) in India, whereas internationally accepted methodologies for foreign investors accord a certain value to the shares (for which the fair market value is the floor price).\n\nIn essence, this would mean that every international investor would be paying a share premium. As the fair market value, as determined under Section 11UA of the IT Act, would be the floor price, any valuation accorded to the shares would be above that floor price (which is also because the share price is a result of negotiations).\n\nCritique of the Amendment\n This amendment effectively makes angel tax mandatory on all foreign investments. Since the fair market value serves as the floor price, any share price resulting from negotiations between the buyer and the seller must exceed this floor price. This move essentially means that Parliament is imposing angel tax on all foreign angel investments. \n\nReturning to the objective of this section, we can see that its earlier stated purpose was to prevent the circulation of unaccounted money through share premiums. However, it also serves an unstated objective of regulating and monitoring foreign direct investment into the country.\n\nAnother critique of the amendment relates to the nature of share premium. Traditionally, share premium is not considered income but rather the value that shareholders pay over the share price based on the potential of the company. Taxing share premium on foreign direct investment could be seen as a hindrance to the start-up community in raising capital from foreign investors. The amendment deprives companies of good market-driven economic valuation, negatively impacting price negotiations.\n\nThe overarching and cascading effect of this amendment would be a reduction in foreign investments in start-ups. It may also force start-ups to place holding structures overseas and shift the place of effective management abroad to avoid pressure from potential investors regarding the impact of this amendment.\n\nA potential immediate consequence could be start-ups pushing to get investment deals done before 1 April 2023 (the date this amendment would become applicable) to avoid paying taxes on share premiums. Exemptions to this tax have only been given to recognized start-ups.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe author concludes that this form of angel tax moves India away from the international standards of business freedom that we are trying to attain. If India is to become a more attractive investment destination, we should enact laws that are more investor-friendly, especially for international investors. The angel tax prevents money from coming into the hands of Indian companies, as the excess income to be taxed forms part of income from other sources under Section 56 of the IT Act. The dual regulation discussed in this article needs to be addressed by the Parliament to reduce the compliance requirements for international investors.\nFEMAAngel TaxFMVIncome-Tax Act\nTaxation Law\n226 views\n7 likes.

        "content": "Shantanu Dhingra\nApr 10\n6 min read\nStriking a Balance: Analyzing SEBI’s Consultation Paper on Carrying Forward Investments in AIF Funds\n[Shantanu is a student at National Law University, Odisha.]\n\nIndia's alternative investment landscape has seen significant growth, with alternative investment funds (AIFs) becoming crucial in the financial ecosystem. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) plays a vital role in shaping AIF regulations. Over time, challenges like stranded investments, limited flexibility, and suboptimal risk management have emerged. To address these issues, SEBI released a consultation paper exploring the possibility of allowing AIFs to carry forward unliquidated investments upon a scheme's completion. This means investors can retain their investments instead of redeeming them at the end of the fund's tenure.\n\nThis article evaluates SEBI's proposed framework for alternative investments, including eligibility criteria, disclosure requirements, compliance measures, and industry impact. Recommendations are provided to balance investor interests and regulatory concerns while aligning with international best practices. The article aims to contribute to developing a resilient and dynamic alternative investment landscape in India by analyzing the consultation paper.\n\nExamining the Proposed Regulatory Framework: A Critical Analysis\n\nSEBI's consultation paper introduces a regulatory framework that allows investors to carry forward investments from one AIF to another without redeeming their interests. This change presents greater flexibility, potential for higher returns, and reduces the risk of stranded investments. However, it is crucial to scrutinize the proposed framework's eligibility criteria, disclosure requirements, and compliance measures to ensure transparency and risk mitigation.\n\nEligibility criteria: striking the right balance\n\nThe consultation paper proposes specific eligibility criteria, such as the AIF's category, the investor's holding period, and the proportion of unliquidated investments. While these criteria aim to protect investor interests and maintain regulatory oversight, they may inadvertently restrict the pool of eligible AIFs and investors, limiting the framework's intended benefits. A more refined approach, focusing on the core investment objectives and risk profiles of AIFs and investors, could be more effective in balancing protection and flexibility.\n\nDisclosure requirements: ensuring adequate transparency \n\nThe proposed framework mandates comprehensive disclosure requirements for AIFs carrying forward investments, including details of carried forward assets, their valuation, and potential conflicts of interest. Although these requirements contribute to transparency and informed decision-making, they may impose significant administrative burdens on AIFs. A critical analysis reveals that a more streamlined disclosure process, emphasizing material changes in investments and risk factors, could enhance transparency without unduly burdening AIFs.\n\nCompliance measures: mitigating risks and maintaining stability \n\nThe consultation paper outlines compliance measures such as obtaining investor consent, adhering to investment restrictions, and engaging independent third parties for due diligence. While these measures serve to mitigate risks and maintain stability in the alternative investment industry, they may create challenges for AIFs in terms of implementation and ongoing compliance. A more pragmatic approach, focusing on key risk factors and prioritizing investor protection, could strike a balance between risk mitigation and operational efficiency.\n\nThe proposed regulatory framework presents promising opportunities for investors and the alternative investment industry in India. However, a critical examination of the eligibility criteria, disclosure requirements, and compliance measures reveals potential areas for improvement. By refining these aspects, the framework can better balance investor interests and regulatory concerns, ultimately fostering a more resilient and dynamic alternative investment landscape.\n\nPotential Benefits of Carrying Forward Investments\n\nIncreased flexibility\n\nCarrying forward investments allow investors to reallocate their capital more efficiently, enabling them to invest in newer funds with better prospects. For example, when the Blackstone Group exited its investment in India's first publicly listed real estate investment trust (REIT), Embassy Office Parks, in 2021, the proposed carry forward regulations could have provided Blackstone with the option to carry forward their investments to another AIF. This promotes a more dynamic alternative investment landscape and encourages innovation.\n\nPotential for higher returns\n\nBy carrying forward investments, investors can potentially access higher returns by participating in funds with stronger growth potential or better management teams. This aligns with the long-term interests of investors and fosters greater investment opportunities.\n\nReduced risk of stranded investments\n\nThe ability to carry forward investments mitigates the risk of investors being stuck in underperforming funds or those nearing their end-of-life. This reduces capital inefficiencies and promotes a healthier investment ecosystem.\n\nRegulatory concerns\n\nCarrying forward investments in AIFs present potential legal risks that need to be carefully considered and mitigated. One of the main concerns for regulators is the possibility of increased risk due to investors inadvertently exposing themselves to excessive risk by transferring their investments to riskier funds. As a result, robust risk management and disclosure requirements are necessary to safeguard investor interests and maintain market stability.\n\nThis increased risk has significant implications for the stability of the alternative investment industry. Regulators must balance the need to protect investors with the need to ensure that the proposed framework does not undermine the stability of the industry. The failure to address these concerns could result in market volatility, investor losses, and potential systemic risks.\n\nComparative Analysis with International Practices and Proposed Recommendations\n\nIn assessing the effectiveness and competitiveness of SEBI's proposed regulatory framework, it is crucial to critically compare it with international best practices in the alternative investment industry. This comparison offers valuable insights into how the consultation paper aligns with or deviates from globally recognized norms and what improvements can be made. \n\nThe United States\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates alternative investments under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The US regulatory framework emphasizes transparency and investor protection, imposing stringent disclosure and reporting requirements on fund managers. For instance, the SEC's Form PF mandates private fund managers to report detailed information about their funds to regulators, which includes information on the fund's investment strategy, risk exposure, and liquidity. By incorporating lessons from the US approach to transparency, SEBI's consultation paper could strengthen disclosure requirements for AIFs, such as providing more comprehensive performance data, investment strategy information, and risk exposure. This would not only bolster investor protection but also align the Indian framework with international best practices.\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe EU's Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) governs the management and marketing of AIFs within the EU. The AIFMD focuses on risk management, liquidity management, and transparency, emphasizing investor protection and systemic risk reduction. For example, the AIFMD requires fund managers to establish and maintain robust risk management systems, including predefined risk limits and mandatory stress testing. Additionally, the AIFMD imposes strict liquidity management provisions to mitigate risks arising from potential asset-liability mismatches. By integrating such risk management measures and liquidity management provisions, the proposed framework can promote market stability and align with the EU's approach to alternative investments.\n\nIncorporating International Best Practices\n\nSEBI can enhance its proposed framework by incorporating international best practices through critical analysis of similarities and differences. This will ensure India's alternative investment industry remains resilient and competitive globally. The recommendations are based on a detailed comparative analysis.\n\nFiduciary duty of AIF managers  \n\nSEBI should reinforce AIF managers' fiduciary duty to their investors to promote responsible investment decisions and mitigate conflicts of interest. Guidelines outlining AIF manager's obligations, including transparent communication, due diligence, and focus on long-term value creation, could be implemented. The regulatory framework could hold managers accountable for any breach of their fiduciary duty, including sanctions and penalties. This will create an environment of trust and confidence between investors and managers, promoting a stable and well-functioning alternative investment ecosystem in India.\n\nEnhance transparency and disclosure requirements\n\nStrengthening disclosure requirements, including detailed performance data, management team background, and investment strategies, will provide investors with comprehensive information. Drawing lessons from the U.S. SEC's Form PF, which requires private fund managers to report detailed information about their funds to regulators, India can enhance investor protection and boost investor confidence. Increased transparency will enable better decision-making, attracting more investment and fostering growth in India's alternative investment ecosystem.\n\nImplement robust risk management measures \n\nAdopting additional risk management measures, such as predefined risk limits and mandatory stress testing, will curb excessive risk-taking and help investors become more aware of potential risks. The EU's AIFMD offers a valuable example, with its focus on risk management and liquidity management, which has helped maintain market stability and resilience. By adopting similar measures in India, the industry will foster investor trust and ultimately attract more investments.\n\nEnhanced investor education\n\nTo enhance investor education, India should implement programs or require AIFs to provide detailed educational materials. The US SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy serves as an excellent model, providing resources and tools to help investors better understand financial products and investment concepts. Similar initiatives in India will improve investor understanding of alternative investments, leading to better investment choices and increased engagement in the alternative investment ecosystem.\n\nRefined eligibility criteria \n\nThe proposed eligibility criteria for carrying forward unliquidated AIF investments could exclude certain long-term AIFs and investors due to the tenure completion requirement without extension. The three-year minimum holding period and 10% cap on unliquidated investments may be restrictive for some AIFs. To address these limitations, the criteria should allow AIFs to extend their tenure if necessary and adopt a more flexible minimum holding period of one or two years. The proportion of unliquidated investments to be carried forward should depend on each AIF's strategy and risk profile, with regular updates provided for transparency and risk mitigation. This refinement will make the carry forward option more accessible to diverse investors and AIFs, maximizing its potential benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, SEBI's consultation paper offers a chance to address challenges in India's alternative investment landscape while promoting innovation and growth. By scrutinizing the proposed framework and integrating international best practices, SEBI can establish a balanced regulatory environment that safeguards investor interests, fosters transparency, and mitigates risks. This article's recommendations provide a roadmap for refining the framework, emphasizing investor education, global standard alignment, and improved investor representation. These enhancements will help develop a thriving, resilient alternative investment ecosystem in India, benefiting investors and the broader financial market.\nAIFSEBIDisclosureComplianceSECAIFMD\nCorporate Law\n322 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Stuck on Subjectivity: Envisioning an Alternate Assessment of Director's Good Faith Duty",
        "content": "Piyush Senapati\nApr 8\n7 min read\nStuck on Subjectivity: Envisioning an Alternate Assessment of Director's Good Faith Duty\n[Piyush is a student at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nThe role of directors in the corporate governance structure cannot be understated. Being the flagships of any company, there are certain duties that are intrinsic to their roles. While these duties escaped statutory codification in the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, they are now crystallised in Section 166 of the Companies Act 2013. Amongst the duties this section imposes on directors, one of the most significant duties is the duty to act in good faith and promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. As defined by the JJ Irani Committee, this essentially means that directors must discharge their duties in the best interest of the company and not use their position in an improper manner so as to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else. There are  two major approaches or standards in company law jurisprudence across the globe i.e., the subjective and objective approaches. While the subjective standard has been endorsed by the Indian courts, this piece highlights the drawbacks of both the approaches and puts forward a case for a combined subjective-objective approach. \n\nThe Subjective and Objective Approaches: What Do They Entail? \n\nThe subjective approach, first formulated by British courts, establishes liability based on the subjective state of mind of the director in question. Therefore, a director is said to have complied with his duty of acting in good faith if he acts in what he considers to be in the company’s interest, regardless of how poor or questionable his conduct might be. This approach is perfectly described in the United Kingdom (UK) Court of Appeal in Re Smith & Fawcett Ltd as follows:\n\n“Directors must exercise their discretion bona fide in what they consider, and not what a court may consider is in the interests of the company.” \n\nSubsequently, courts in the UK formulated the objective approach, under which the court first assesses the act based on the relevant circumstantial factors to understand if it is actually in the interests of the company. Once that exercise is undertaken, the court then tests the director’s conduct in relation to that determination - it essentially sees whether the director has acted in a way which is actually in the company’s interests. Alternatively, UK courts apply the test formulated in Charterbridge v. Lloyd Bank Ltd (Charterbridge test) which entails assessing as to whether the director acted in a way that a reasonable man would consider to be in the company’s interest. \n\nIt is important to note that these approaches were formulated before directors’ duties were codified in the UK, and the current section in the UK company law lays down a combination of both the subjective and objective approaches.  \n\nDrawbacks of Both Approaches\n\nThe subjective standard has been subject to intense criticism. Its drawbacks are best encapsulated by the UK Court of Appeal in  Hutton  v. West Cork Railway Co as follows:\n\n“Bona fide cannot be the sole test, otherwise you might have a lunatic conducting the affairs of the company, paying away its money in a manner perfectly bona fide but completely irrational.”\n\nThus, the main problem with employing a solely subjective test is that it is too lax- there is ample scope for directors to circumvent liability,[1] even when their conduct is outrightly unreasonable or harmful. By giving such credence to the directors’ unverifiable psychological beliefs regarding the company’s interests, this approach effectively curtails the court from evaluating the merits of and finding ulterior motives in the directors’ conduct. Such flaws are evident in factual matrix of the Bombay High Court case of Balwant Transport Company Limited, Amraoti v. YH Deshpande, wherein a director was held to be acting in good faith when he refused to register the  transfer of shares on the ground that the purchaser had relations with the director’s adversary - for the director believed that having him as a shareholder would be detrimental to the company. Further, since the entire premise of this approach is based on the director’s beliefs regarding the company’s interests, it would be completely inadequate where the director did not consider the company’s interests at all before making a decision.[2] \n\nOn the other hand, the objective approach subsequently adopted by UK courts is not ideal either. This approach poses the danger of holding directors liable merely because they did not act in a way that the court or a ‘reasonable man’ would consider to be in the company’s interest, essentially giving inadequate deference to the director’s decisions and discretion. Further, the ex post facto analysis undertaken by the courts regarding what is in the company’s interests has a huge possibility of being influenced by hindsight bias- what the court believes to be in the company’s best interests retrospectively could very well differ from what it might have thought to be in the company’s interests at the particular time when the decision was actually made, especially in light of the uncertainty and incomplete information with which business decisions are usually taken. The particular facts of the Singapore High Court case of OP3 International v. Foo Kian Beng perfectly demonstrate this. In that case, the director paid dividends to shareholders even though there was ongoing litigation for substantial damages against the company, based on the lawyers’ assurance that the company had a strong defence and was likely to win the case. However, the company ultimately lost and had to pay a huge sum, rendering it insolvent. Employing the objective standard, the court held the dividend payment to be a breach of the director’s good faith duty. This is a perfect instance of hindsight bias making an assessment of the directors’ duties completely divorced from the commercial reality of uncertainty faced by directors when making business decisions. \n\nIndian Courts’ Stance on the Subjective-Objective Debate\n\nA long line of precedent reveals that Indian courts have always endorsed the subjective standard.[3] This is evident by the Supreme Court’s holding in the case of Bajaj Auto v. NK Firodia (Bajaj Auto). In this case, the directors had refused to register the transfer of shares that were purchased by a certain group believing that transfer sought was part of a male fide design to acquire interest in the company to threaten the smooth functioning of its management. Although the directors were ultimately held liable for not acting in good faith, the court held that the acts of directors would have to be analysed as to whether they were under an honest belief that they were acting in the company’s interest. While an explicit judicial endorsement of the objective standard is lacking, some courts and tribunals can be seen moving towards the same, such as the NCLT in Mar Jacob Thoomkuzhy  v. Jeevan Telecasting Corporation Limited, wherein the respondent directors removed the petitioner directors from directorship and started acquiring shares in the company with the ulterior motive of taking over it. Holding the respondents liable, the NCLT held that:\n\n“A director must ensure that his conduct confirms to the standard of a reasonably prudent person.”\n\nHowever, the subjective standard as endorsed in Bajaj Auto still remains the binding judicial precedent in India. In Nanalal Zaver v. Bombay Life Assurance Co, the need to strike a balance between allowing directors the space to take business decisions as per their commercial wisdom and intervening when their conduct is not bona fide was highlighted. As long as either the subjective or objective approach is exclusively followed, it is evident that this balance will never be achieved. \n\nThe Combined Subjective-Objective Approach: The Way Forward? \n\nThe flaws prevalent in both the approaches- leniency in the subjective standard and hindsight bias without adequate consideration to the director’s commercial wisdom in the objective one have led courts to strike a balance and formulate a hybrid standard i.e., the combined subjective – objective approach. Such an approach is best exemplified by the Australian case of Bell v. Westpac, wherein the court held that the assessment of the director’s duty is a largely subjective exercise, with a focus on ascertaining whether the director was under the honest belief that his actions were in the company’s interests. To determine the veracity of this belief, and to “accept or discount the assertions directors make about their beliefs”, the court held that the circumstances and surrounding facts of the case are to be probed into objectively. \n\nThis exercise avoids substituting the courts’ ex-post facto commercial judgement regarding the company’s interests for the director’s. It also brings in an element of objectivity as it gives the court an opportunity to probe into the facts of the case to decide whether to accept the director’s beliefs as honest or not. Thus, this approach being neither too lax nor too onerous is easily the best available method for assessing a director’s good faith. The merits of this approach are also highlighted by the recent shift towards this standard in other common law jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion  \n\nThe diligence with which directors perform their duties would naturally depend on the intensity with which their acts are scrutinised by courts. Indian company directors, being subject to the lax subjective standard have ample space to evade liability for failing to act in good faith. While a departure from this standard would be very welcome, the recent inching towards the objective standard evident in some judgements should not be seen as cause celebre either due to above-mentioned flaws with such an approach. Therefore, the combined subjective-objective approach, if endorsed by the Indian judiciary would not only secure the aim of striking a balance between directorial discretion and appropriate judicial intervention highlighted in Nanalal Zaver, but also ensure that the Indian approach is in tandem with the shift taking place in other common law jurisdictions.\n[1] Despotovic, Damjan, ‘Fiduciary Duties and the Business Judgment Rule (with the Emphasis\non the Citigroup Case)’ (LLM Thesis, University of Tilburg 2010) p. 36\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=1639338.\n[2] Umakanth Varotill, ‘Directors’ Liability and Climate Risk: White Paper on India  (Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative, 2021) 20 https://ssrn.com/abstract=3936428). \n[3] Id.\nCompanies ActDirectorCorporate GovernanceGood FaithSubjective-Objective\nCorporate Law\n163 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency: The India Story",
        "content": "Rachita Bhat, Deborshi Barat\nApr 2\n12 min read\nGreen Buildings and Energy Efficiency: The India Story\n[Rachita is a Partner and Deborshi is a Counsel at S&R Associates. The article was first published on Mondaq.]\n\nWith 10 million new homes required to be built every year to keep pace with Indian housing demand, significant opportunities exist with regard to establishing new techniques in climate-responsive construction. Within this market, green buildings[1] have immense investment potential for both residential and commercial use.  \n\nMost markets around the world, including emerging ones, remain deeply engaged in the process of articulating, and eventually pursuing, sustainability and/or other allied goals, such as those stemming from climate change, global warming, as well as environmental, social, and governance-related (ESG) priorities. As part of their short-term goals on ESG, listed developers may want to substantially increase their green portfolio by the end of the decade, along with ramping up deployment of renewable energy. Further, an increasing number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) are participating in global ESG benchmarks for commercial real estate. \n\nAccordingly, it is useful to examine the actual cost of pursuing such goals. This pursuit includes making informed estimates about the availability of resources and funding with respect to goal-realization, especially given extant housing demand in India in terms of both residential buildings and Grade A commercial/industrial assets.\n\nPresent Forecasts\n\nThe global pivot on sustainable development has revitalized preferences among both occupiers and developers for green certified commercial buildings.[2] According to a JLL[3] study conducted last year across major Indian cities, well above two-fifths of all commercial Grade A office stock had a green certification.[4] Further, this penetration rate was poised to cross 50% over the next decade.[5] Moreover, almost three quarters of new supply is likely to be rated green, while older projects may undergo upgrades for the purpose of reducing their carbon footprint. \n\nIn this regard, according to a more recent real estate outlook (Colliers Report) released by Colliers International Property Consultants, Inc. earlier this month (March 2023),[6] a burgeoning ESG focus has created significant opportunities for landlords and developers to upgrade outdated office assets.[7] Further, this year promises to witness greater activity from developers towards improving both efficiency and sustainability in their buildings.[8] Among other considerations, such upgrades are expected to provide long-term benefits and enable the underlying assets to remain competitive. In addition, 2023 is predicted to evidence increased green financing, as domestic and offshore investors seek good quality Grade A projects that are sustainable and ESG compliant.\n\nBRSR\n\nFurther, according to a recent consultation paper,[9] the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) soon plans to introduce an assurance-driven reporting regime (BRSR Core) as a subset of the wider Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework – which, in turn, SEBI had introduced in May 2021[10] to ensure standardized disclosures on ESG-linked parameters. While the top 1,000 listed companies in India (by market capitalization) could make these ESG-based disclosures on a voluntary basis until now, from FY 2022-23 onwards, such disclosures are mandatory. In addition, the list of mandated reporting entities may be expanded upon later.\n\nWhile BRSR Core, by design, has been formulated on the basis of ‘reasonable assurance’ (similar to an audit verification), the general BRSR framework also requires quantitative data with respect to ESG across key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the quantum of investment made towards reducing a company’s environmental footprint.[11] The environmental footprint of a building, for instance, can be measured in several ways – ranging from the amount of carbon used in construction, as well as to maintain a building through its lifecycle; to the everyday consumption of resources such as water and energy; to the amount of waste produced. Thus, based on the KPIs under the wider BRSR regime, reporting about both investments made and capital expenditure incurred in respect of green and/or energy-efficient buildings (e.g., through the use of environment-friendly and sustainable building materials, or providing for ‘smart technological’ heating or ventilation) may significantly improve ESG ratings, and thereby reduce the cost of future capital.\n\nThe Regulatory Environment\n\nThe Energy Conservation Act 2001 (EC Act) specifies norms and standards for appliances and equipment, as well as in respect of building construction. Established by the EC Act, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a body functioning under the Ministry of Power, administers such standards through interventions such as: (1) a ‘star labeling’ system for ACs,[12] (2) a voluntary rating program for commercial buildings, and (3) the ‘Perform, Achieve, Trade’ (PAT) scheme.[13] Formulating building codes with regard to energy conservation also falls within the EC Act’s ambit. Accordingly, the BEE has pursued initiatives such as the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC).[14] \n\nRecently, the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act 2022 (EC Amendment) came into force. Among other important changes, the EC Amendment has now included large residential buildings under the EC Act’s regulatory regime, along with enhancing the scope of ECBC.\n\nGreen Buildings: Opportunities and Challenges\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that green buildings are a higher-value, lower-risk asset than standard structures. Further, new constructions offer a significant opportunity to integrate energy efficiency into building design from the outset, avoiding the bother of expensive retrofits later.\n\nHowever, there are a number of constraints in this regard, which include the perception of high construction costs, a lack of alignment between incentives and benefits, as well as a mismatch between (1) short hold periods with respect to real estate assets in portfolios, on the one hand; and (2) long building lifespans on the other – especially when coupled with the possibility of stricter future regulation. Nevertheless, there does exist strong market sentiment along with corresponding demand for energy efficient buildings in India. Local developers are increasingly realizing that the additional capital expenditure (capex) incurred upfront is likely to be offset by the significant savings made on operational costs (opex) over the longer term.\n\nInvestors and Financers \n\nReal estate financers and investors may influence the market for green buildings in meaningful ways. In terms of commercial bank lending – construction finance, mortgages, home improvement loans, and green financial products for resource-efficient buildings can significantly accelerate the uptake of green buildings, along with lower interest rates and longer tenors. As a result, such banks can diversify their client base and product offerings, build higher-value and lower-risk portfolios, and access new sources of finance through green bonds, green securitizations, and green credit facilities. On the other hand, institutional investors that participate in green real estate can help inject liquidity in such markets and enable primary lenders to free up capital to develop new green lending products. \n\nIn addition, multinational development finance institutions (DFIs) such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can catalyze nascent markets and facilitate the entry of private investors, including foreign ones. DFIs provide a range of financial products not readily available in most markets, often in combination with technical support and capacity-building programs. These institutions can also build the government’s capacity to develop enabling environments. Indeed, DFIs such as IFC have actively invested in affordable housing in India. DFIs also have specific ESG and other sustainability standards/policies that are required to be monitored and complied with, which would include investments in green and resource-efficient buildings.\n\nThe Government \n\nThe government can create a pipeline of green building assets and incentivize financers to route their capital to this sector. Specifically, it can enhance investor appetite by requiring public buildings to be green. In turn, this can build technical capacity and skills among designers, engineers, and workers, who might then become better equipped to construct privately financed green buildings.\n\nFiscal incentives like tax breaks, grants, subsidies, loans, and rebates, complemented by non-fiscal incentives such as preferential or expedited permits, can also be put into play. Further, mandatory building codes may ensure that green measures are incorporated from the outset.\n Building Codes \n\nWhile the ECBC represents a key regulatory policy with regard to space cooling in new commercial buildings (such as offices, malls, hotels, hospitals, airports, educational institutions, etc.), the results of implementation have been relatively modest, including on account of the absence of a strong enforcement regime. A recent report[15] by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has suggested concrete steps for public departments to: (1) integrate ECBC across government-led construction, and (2) operationalize recommendations for space cooling as issued by the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP).\n\nNevertheless, the EC Amendment has now introduced the idea of sustainability, where a new building code related to energy conservation will provide norms for the use of renewable sources, as well as for green buildings. Further, while the ECBC applies to a specified category of commercial buildings only, the new code will apply to office and residential buildings as well, subject to certain specifications.[16]\n\nGiven emerging ESG trends and ESG-related organizational policies around the world, most multinational companies (MNCs) looking to lease or set up offices in India are keen to occupy premises with green energy/sustainability ratings, thereby incentivizing Indian developers to incur additional capex to procure such ratings. In turn, such developers can effectively monetize Grade A commercial and industrial assets since the target end-users and lessees are often large-scale MNCs. \n\nVoluntary Commitments\n\nA surge in the voluntary adoption of green construction practices by private real estate developers and owners can create much-needed momentum. Current commitments range from greening individual buildings and portfolios to joining ambitious pledges through international platforms and initiatives. Such commitments have been primarily linked to, and delivered through, green building certification programs.\n\nRating Systems\n\nVoluntary green building ratings systems – such as the Indian edition of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA), Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), etc. – have proved somewhat successful in the commercial building segment, driven by green policies among larger companies. However, India does not yet have a mandatory green construction code or a set of mandatory green building standards like in the US – where the International Green Construction Code (IgCC)[17] and ASHRAE 189.1,[18] respectively, apply in specific cases. \n\nNevertheless, the LEED benchmark has been recognized by most developers and builders in India. Further, GRIHA was adopted as the national rating system for green buildings in India by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in 2007.[19] GRIHA evaluates the environmental performance of a building based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, providing a definitive standard for green buildings.\n\nEnforcement\n\nStrictly enforced labeling and energy performance certifications for buildings and appliances by the BEE can ensure better compliance with green standards, catalyze the market for energy-efficient technologies, and generate market data to help financial intermediaries select efficient buildings to invest in.\n\nFurther, various policy options can be adjusted to suit local legal frameworks as well as unique socioeconomic contexts. Training construction industry professionals and officials can make enforcement easier. Stakeholder engagement that incorporates the interests and expertise of the public and private sectors, respectively, can help remove some barriers to compliance. Mandating third-party certification can address ‘greenwashing’ concerns and ensure that only legitimate recipients receive incentives without overextending public sector overheads.\n\nAt the State Level\n\nThe National Building Code of India 2016 (NBC)[20] has been revisited in certain Indian states to serve the latter’s particular sustainability goals. In Haryana, for instance, the government has incentivized GRIHA/IGBC/LEED-rated projects by awarding additional floor area ratio (FAR) in respect of all building use (except plotted residential), and especially for the purpose of achieving such ratings pursuant to an amendment in the Haryana Building Code 2017. The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority also offers additional FAR to developers with gold/platinum IGBC ratings. \n\nThe Way Forward\n\nFuture digitalization may further expand opportunities for space cooling across buildings. The diffusion of internet-connected devices in the residential and commercial sectors may allow added integration across demand and supply. From the government’s perspective, policies need to take into consideration the opportunities that arise from the emergence of digital technologies – which, in turn, can make cooling and other buildings-related energy services more sustainable. For instance, the roll-out of smart thermostats can reduce energy consumption in response to real-time price signals. \n\nHowever, there are concerns with widespread digitalization as well, including in respect of data security and privacy, along with technical and economic considerations. Given the fragmented nature of local laws on construction, sustainability goals vis-à-vis buildings are often compromised in terms of implementation. With the rise in demand for Grade A assets with appropriate green energy ratings for commercial and industrial leasing, there is much to be done in terms of addressing additional capex requirements. \n\nDistrict Cooling and Trigeneration\n\nIndia’s large-scale space cooling requirements can be met through new technologies, including through the use of delivery/distribution models involving ‘cooling as a service’ (CaaS). However, viable implementation models will be necessary to support such business and operations, such as those of district cooling systems (DCS). A DCS produces chilled water in a central plant and delivers it to buildings through an insulated distribution network and via energy transfer stations. The idea of a ‘merchant’ DCS in India is relatively new - it involves the aggregation of different demand groups such as special economic zones and large commercial business districts in a CaaS model. Nevertheless, emerging examples include the GIFT City in Gujarat and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh. In the latter case, a foreign cooling service provider entered into a long-term concession agreement with the state government. \n\nGlobally, DCS projects have been developed under various business paradigms. A variety of stakeholders such as municipal corporations, state governments, building developers, international finance providers, special purpose vehicles (SPVs), etc., can invest in such projects. For example, in Dubai, building developers double up as utility operators to provide services such as water, waste, power, and cooling in integrated townships. Other business models (e.g., in London, Paris) are based on public utilities investing directly in such integrated projects, with their investment linked to the underlying incentives related to land, access to energy sources and wastewater connections, as well as to revenue streams. Accordingly, an Indian implementation agency could coordinate among various stakeholders and manage the different processes involved, such as those of tendering, financing, and setting up a district cooling network, including under the aegis of a public-private partnership (PPP) model.\n\nFor instance, a couple of years ago, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a state-owned Indian company, entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with GAIL (India) Limited to develop trigeneration projects. Tri-generation is a process that provides combined cooling, heating, and power from a single generator, producing electricity and utilizing the residual heat to generate chilled water for air-conditioning or refrigeration using a chiller. Pursuant to this MoU, EESL will be responsible for the upfront capital costs and risks, as well as  provide tri-generation to customers through an offtake based on a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). This model may serve as a template to create a viable ecosystem for tri-generation projects in the future, along with standard contractual and operating processes to develop a CaaS model. \n\nFinally, scaling up new cooling technologies and business models will require cities to become ‘smart’ and have longer horizons for meeting space cooling demand in a sustainable manner.

        "title": "Digital Market Regulation: The Indian Perspective",
        "content": "Aaryaman Soumitra Pathare\nMar 31\n6 min read\nDigital Market Regulation: The Indian Perspective\n[Aaryaman is a student at ILS Law College, Pune.]\n\nThe Report of the Standing Committee on Finance (2022-23), presented on 22 December 2022, is a consequence of the growing need to regulate digital markets. The report follows the ethos of the Digital Markets Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/1925) (DMA), which has been enforced recently in the EU competition regime and which adopts a strong stance against big tech enterprises, seemingly based on the premise that dominance in a digital market is necessarily a threat to competition.\n\nThe report suggests mechanisms identical to those implemented via the DMA, such as the designation of sizeable online platforms as systemically important digital intermediaries (SIDI), similar to the classification of gatekeepers under the DMA, and a focus on the ex-ante regulation of such entities.\n\nThe report recommends a per se prohibition against practices such as bundling/tying, data usage, anti-steering clauses, self-preferencing and exclusive contracts by SIDIs.  Some recommendations in the report, however, suffer from a lack of analysis and have been discussed in brief within this article.\n\nClassification of SIDIs \n\nThe classification of digital intermediaries for ex-ante regulation is the focal point of the report. While the report does not detail how such entities will be classified in the Indian competition regime, it shall likely rely upon the EU system. In the DMA, companies that operate core platform services (CPS), while also crossing a threshold of a number of business users and consumers and financial size, are classified as gatekeepers. CPS consists of: \nonline intermediation services;\nonline search engines;\nonline social networking services;\nvideo-sharing platform services;\nnumber-independent interpersonal communication services;\noperating systems;\ncloud computing services;\nadvertising services;\nweb browsers;\nvirtual assistants.\n\nAlthough there is a necessity to regulate major platform intermediaries primarily due to network effects, it must be kept in mind that network effects are not a justification for such regulations in the case of some digital markets. Consumer base is the primary qualitative factor of most zero-price markets, such as social networking services (Facebook, Instagram), video-sharing platforms (YouTube), and advertising services. \n\nOn the other hand, subscription-based services such as movie streaming platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime) constitute a market with no single dominant entity. In markets that involve price considerations, users are not motivated by user base but by cost of use and quality of service. Consumers are therefore incentivized to switch services if the quality of one drops, or the other rises; a phenomenon absent in consumer-base reliant zero-price markets. Therefore, in this regard, such digital markets are similar to traditional markets and ought not to be bundled up with other digital markets.\n\nAnother aspect Indian lawmakers ought to consider while determining the thresholds for the designation of SIDIs is the existence of certain entities in multiple markets. For instance, YouTube competes in the music as well as movie streaming platform markets. However, it falls under the category of CPS, as a video-sharing platform as well as an advertising service. \n\nThe regulations to be imposed on the SIDIs participating in multiple markets therefore ought to be only to the extent that they fall within such CPS, and not beyond these markets. Therefore, for the purposes of equal treatment of competitors, YouTube, when assessed as a movie or music streaming platform, ought not to be subject to these regulations.\n\nAdvertising Policy and Search Ranking Preference\n\nThe committee recommended the introduction of provisions that mandate SIDIs to provide advertisers with information on a daily basis. SIDIs may also be compelled to share performance-measuring tools with advertisers availing their services. It also suggested compelling platforms to provide advertisers with high-quality search terms that may assist them in creating better advertisements.\n\nThe proposed notion is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, from a competition perspective, the imposition of such a rule would serve only to harm the position of weaker platforms. In the present scenario, dominant platforms are not incentivized to bear the additional cost needed to provide such benefits to advertisers due to the stronger negotiating power, generated through network effects. This, in turn, provides weaker platforms an opportunity to offer this feature to attract advertisers. This advantage will be lost if dominant platforms are mandated to offer such privileges to advertisers, reducing intra-platform competition.\n\nSecondly, the regulation seeks to treat larger platforms as public utilities that exist only to facilitate entities in the downstream market. There is no legal justification provided in the report that warrants platforms bearing additional costs that may be incurred to develop and provide performance-measuring tools. Competition Law confers a negative right upon competitors. The object of antitrust legislation is to prevent stronger entities from eliminating competitors and consequently hurting consumer interest. It does not, however, entail a positive right to weaker firms against dominant entities. Competition law is premised on the notion that greater competition leads to greater efficiency in a market. It is an infringement upon the economic rights of enterprises, in particular, the freedom to contract, for the greater good. Therefore, it is a necessary evil to protect the interests of consumers. Consequently, antitrust laws are only restrictive in nature, with respect to inter-enterprise conduct, within a market. They do not, however, impose an obligation to actively do something for the benefit of another firm. It is antithetical to the object of the Competition Act 2002, that an obligation be imposed on an enterprise to involuntarily assist a competitor (since most SIDIs will be entities that will also be participating in the downstream market of advertising). \n\nSelf-Preferencing\n\nSelf-preferencing is a practice whereby platforms favour their own services or subsidiaries when they are also competing on the same platform. The committee seeks to prevent SIDIs from engaging in self-preferencing, directly or indirectly, to prevent an unfair advantage to platform entities that are also competing on the same platform. \n\nThis regulation may, however, lead to SIDIs removing preferential search results (tags such as top-rated, bestseller, etc.) altogether, as they will not be able to do the same for their own products, without inviting the scrutiny of antitrust authorities. Conversely, they may start charging higher fees for such privileges. \n\nThe purpose of introducing this rule is to ensure greater visibility for weaker firms. However, in the aforementioned scenarios, new entrants may find it difficult to introduce their products to consumers. Simultaneously, established players in the market may benefit merely due to brand value and status quo bias (in cases of pre-installed apps on smartphones, or tied-in/recommended complementary service that improve the efficiency of the primary service.) . Weaker intermediaries in the present regime can offer such incentives to attract business users, but this will no longer be an advantage they possess against SIDIs.\n\nThe idea of banning self-preferencing only for SIDIs is also ineffective in both short-term as well as long term. Existing big tech companies like Google and Amazon have already reaped the benefits of self-preferencing, as seen by their share in the relevant market and a consequent restriction will not significantly affect the consumer base it has already accrued. \n\nFurthermore, any digital intermediary in the future may engage in self-preferencing as long as they do not meet the threshold for the classification as a SIDI. Therefore, they may give preferential treatment, and use consumer data to improve such preferred services. In such a scenario, if the digital intermediary were to cross the threshold,(thereby possessing a sizeable user base and financial power) it shall have already benefited from this alleged anti-competitive practice, and a consequent restriction will not affect them significantly.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThis is another recommendation in the report that suffers from ambiguity. The committee recommends that all mergers and acquisitions made by SIDIs in the digital sector ought to be notified to the CCI, on the grounds that certain mergers and acquisitions in digital markets escape the scrutiny of the CCI as they do not meet the threshold of assets or turnover.\n\nThis issue, however, was already addressed in the Competition Amendment Bill 2022 (CAB), where a deal value threshold (DVT) was introduced for the purpose of regulating such mergers and acquisitions that may not fall within the existing thresholds (assets and turnover) in Indian competition law. The phrasing of DVT in the bill implies that this new threshold is to apply to all markets, though the Standing Committee Report on the CAB specifically talks about its necessity in digital markets.\n\nConsequently, the DVT has been criticized for having a wider application than the purpose for which it was drafted, as it imposes a regulatory burden on both enterprises and the CCI in most sectors where such a threshold is unnecessary. This burden is completely unjustified in light of the provision mentioned in this report and will render the DVT redundant. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe adoption of ex-ante regulation and excessive scrutiny must entail a thorough assessment of pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects. The object of competition law is not to protect competitors, but to protect consumer interests. Therefore, ex-ante regulation in competition law can only be justified when the legislature is able to show direct harm to consumers, of such a nature that outweighs any benefits that they may accrue. The present report suffers from an absence of such analysis and any subsequent attempt to introduce regulations must entail an examination of all possible effects that it may have.\nDigital MarketCompetitionSystematically Important Digital IntermediariesSelf-Preferencing\nCorporate Law\n•\nCompetition Law\n382 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Competition Law and IPR: Case for Further Limiting Scope of Interference under Article 226",
        "content": "Ashwini Chawla\nMar 26\n5 min read\nCompetition Law and IPR: Case for Further Limiting Scope of Interference under Article 226\n[Ashwini is an Advocate, practicing independently primarily in the Delhi High Court.]\n\nThe interplay of competition law and intellectual property rights (IPR) continues to remain an unresolved issue. As a result, the holder of a patent may approach the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India (Constitution), even after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has passed an order under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act) (thereby causing its Director-General to carry out an investigation). The High Courts are generally circumspect while exercising their jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution in such circumstances and are perhaps even less likely to grant a stay qua an investigation as commenced by the CCI by virtue of an order under Section 26(1) of the Act. \n\nThis issue assumes significance in view of the judgment delivered by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi on 28 July 2022 in the case of Vifor International Limited v. Competition Commission of India (Vifor case). In the facts of that case, the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi declined to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Instead, the Hon’ble High Court came to the conclusion that Vifor International A.G. (Vifor), the holder of a patent against which the CCI had already directed its Director General to initiate an investigation, had approached it at a “pre-mature” stage. Notably, the Hon’ble High Court came to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of the CCI is not completely excluded, even if the subject-matter of the complaint relates to patents. Instead, the same could be said to fall outside its jurisdiction only in limited circumstances wherein a complaint made to the CCI concerns itself “solely or exclusively” with violations of the Patents Act 1970 (Patents Act).  \n\nInherent Contradiction between Competition Law and IPR \n\nAt the outset, it needs to be noted that exclusivity is inherent in the grant of a patent under the Patents Act. This could very well give rise to the impression that there exists an inherent contradiction between the provisions of the Competition Act and the Patents Act. In fact, the High-Level Committee chaired by Mr. S.V.S. Raghavan, whose report arguably forms the edifice of the Competition Act, had flagged the issue of IPRs being used to the detriment of the interests of consumers or the general public. Notwithstanding the same, it needs to be noted that the Competition Act contains no provision which specifically deals with or addresses this issue. Instead, a safe harbour is available under Section 3(5) of the Competition Act to inter alia all such agreements which, in the specific context of a patent granted under the Patents Act, either seek to restrain any infringement of rights conferred upon a patentee under the said Act, or impose reasonable conditions as are necessary for protecting all such rights. In the absence of such safe harbour, all such agreements as entered into by the holder of a patent would be treated no differently than any other agreement for the purposes of the Competition Act. \n\nThat said, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court (Delhi HC) had, in its judgment in Monsanto Holdings Private Limited and Others v. Competition Commission of India and Others, made it sufficiently clear that the safe harbour as available under Section 3(5) of the Competition Act is not an “unqualified\" one and will, therefore, not enable the holder of a patent to impose “onerous conditions” in the guise of protecting its rights. \n\nPatents Act: Ill-equipped to Address Competition Law-related Concerns  \n\nThe Patents Act is clearly insufficient to address any competition law-related concerns resulting from the exercise of rights conferred thereunder to the holder of a patent. In the event that the holder of a patent is found to be committing an abuse of its rights under the Patents Act, the only remedies which are available are the grant of a ‘compulsory license’ (under Section 84), or revocation of the patent itself (under Section 85). At the outset, the Controller of Patents is precluded from granting a ‘compulsory license’ within the first 3 years immediately following the grant of a patent. Even thereafter, the Controller of Patents may grant a ‘compulsory license’ only on the limited grounds which are specifically enumerated under the Patents Act which, essentially speaking, proscribe the failure of the holder of a patent to satisfy the ‘reasonable requirements’ of the public, or to not ensure the availability of the ‘patented invention’ to the public at a ‘reasonably affordable price’, or the non-working of the ‘patented invention’ within India. Furthermore, a patent may be revoked only on the expiry of a period of at least 2 years ever since the grant of the first ‘compulsory license’ and is, therefore, unlikely to present itself as a remedy for at least the first 5 years following the grant of a patent. It is open to the Central Government to, at any time following the grant of a patent make a ‘declaration’ (under Section 92), thereby casting an obligation upon the Controller of Patents to grant a ‘compulsory license’. However, the Central Government may do so only in certain extremely limited circumstances (i.e., ‘national emergency’, or ‘extreme urgency’, or ‘public non-commercial use’). Be that as it may, what follows is that the various remedies available under the Patents Act not only do not specifically address any competition law related concerns in the exercise of rights by the holder of a patent, but also are intended to come into effect in what could be termed as ‘extraordinary circumstances’. \n\nInterplay between the Competition Act and the Patents Act\n\nThe Hon’ble Delhi HC had, in its judgment in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson v. Competition Commission of India, held that there exists no “irreconcilable conflict” between the Competition Act and the Patents Act, and that the Competition Act is not to the exclusion of the Patents Act, and vice versa. In the facts of that case, the Hon’ble Delhi HC took the view that the jurisdiction of the CCI is not ousted, even if the complaint relates to abuse of dominant position by the holder of a patent. In considerable measure, the Hon’ble Delhi HC took note of the fact that an ‘aggrieved party’ may simultaneously seek the grant of a ‘compulsory license’ under the Patents Act and invoke the remedies as otherwise available to it under Section 27 of the Competition Act. Furthermore, the grant of a ‘compulsory license’ is limited to the ‘aggrieved party’ alone, whereas the various remedies as available under Section 27 of the Competition Act are available in rem. The Hon’ble Delhi HC also took into consideration the operation of Sections 21 and 21A of the Competition Act; whereby it is open to the CCI to consult another statutory authority prior to or after taking a decision, and vice-versa. \n\nIt is pertinent to mention that in the facts of that case, the Hon’ble Delhi HC held that it is only the CCI which is empowered to determine as to whether the ‘safe harbour’, as provided for under Section 3(5) of the Competition Act, is attracted or not and the same cannot, in any event, be determined by the Controller of Patents, in as much as it is not specifically empowered to do so under the Patents Act. \n\nScope of Interference under Article 226 of the Constitution and the Case for Clarity\n\nIn view of the foregoing, an authoritative judicial pronouncement which operates so as to further limit the scope of interference by the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, in circumstances such as those in the Vifor case (i.e., the CCI having passed an order under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act against the holder of a patent), is called for. This would also be in consonance with the prevailing judicial view that it is the CCI alone which is empowered and equipped so as to address any competition law related concerns in the exercise of rights by the holder of a patent and to determine whether the safe harbour provided for under Section 3(5) of the Competition Act is attracted or not. \nCompetitionCCICompetition ActIPRArticle 226\nCompetition Law\n520 views\n1 like.

        "title": "“X” Marks the Spot: Determining the Situs of Virtual Digital Assets to Tax Non-Residents",
        "content": "Archita Satish\nMar 23\n6 min read\n“X” Marks the Spot: Determining the Situs of Virtual Digital Assets to Tax Non-Residents\n[Archita is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nThe addition of Section 115BBH to the Income Tax Act 1961 (ITA), has subjected the transfer of virtual digital assets (VDAs), such as cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to a 30% tax. While the amendment has seemingly removed the need to classify to determine the rate of tax applicable on VDA transfers (although income tax returns still allow income from VDAs to be classified as capital gains, business income or special income), its characterisation is still crucial to understand how situs will be determined for non-residents to be taxed in India. This is because the ITA taxes non-residents for income received or which accrues or arises in India during the year, or it is so deemed. With the 2023 Budget failing to provide any clarity, instead imposing a penalty on tax defaulters, this article attempts to analyse the possible implications of characterisation on non-residents for the payment of this tax. \n\nClassification and Implications for Non-Residents: Exploring the Possibilities\n\nBefore we analyse the tax, it is imperative to understand the nature of the assets included. First is cryptocurrency, a digital-only currency generated by a cryptographic decentralised network. This system records and verifies transactions as well as manages issuing through ‘mining’, where peers are rewarded with the currency for solving complex problems. Coming to the second asset - NFTs- they use the same underlying technology as cryptocurrency but are non-fungible, in that they represent a unique digital or non-digital asset, such as art work. The Central Government has also been given the power to notify and exclude assets under the definition. Accordingly, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that VDAs do not include gift cards, mileage or loyalty points, subscriptions or NFT transfers also transferring the underlying tangible asset. \n\nThereby, with VDAs composing of nothing but a string of numbers or letters[i], the confusion regarding their nature and ‘situs’ for tax purposes is justifiable. One view prior to the amendment, when income from VDAs was nonetheless considered taxable, characterised them as “property”. This would make them capital assets on which capital gains become chargeable. Meanwhile, intraday or high frequency cryptocurrency trading as well as mining would be taxable as business income. Alternatively, they were argued to fall under income from other sources (IOS), especially in gifting transactions. These possibilities are explored below:\n\nCapital gains\n\nThe definition of capital assets includes “property of any kind held by an assessee”, in which “property” must be given the widest import to include every possible interest. This arguably includes VDAs, and is buttressed by its inclusion to Section 56. Thus, the principles for capital gains tax (CGT) as under Section 45 could apply where VDAs are held as assets. When it comes to CGT for non-residents, many double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) function on a residence principle, though there are exceptions like the United States and the United Kingdom. Here, CGT is instead taxable as in the domestic country. Thus, if the VDA is situated in India, it becomes taxable.\n It is argued that VDAs, lacking a physical form and being non-monetary, are intangible assets. Thus, like trademarks, this would make them taxable in the location or domicile of the owner. However, in cases where the asset is held in a digital wallet with an exchange as a beneficial owner, there is a view that the location of the nominee, who has access to the private key, which authenticates the holding of the VDA, or the exchange, ought to be considered. For this, the manner of storage of private keys in digital ‘wallets’ is determinative. If the wallet is offline or ‘cold’, then it would be stored on a device held by the owner whose location would be akin to moveable property (following mobiliia sequuntur personam). Meanwhile, if it is stored online or ‘hot’, the location of the server would align with the location of the VDA. \n\nThis latter proposal though more inclusive, may however prove difficult for assessees to determine to compute their tax liability. One possible solution is to determine the location of servers used by digital wallet services through their IP addresses to see if the same falls within India. Further, since digital wallet services are businesses, the government can regulate their use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure that IP addresses are not masked or morphed. The use of IP addresses may also prove useful to determine the location of the non-resident when undertaking trades since secondary cryptocurrency and NFT markets or exchanges can track and store such information. However, in this case, VPNs may enable hiding such transactions, unless their use is completely prohibited in India, which would have drastic implications for digital privacy in general.  \n\nIn the case of NFTs, the situation is near identical in the secondary trading market, save that unlike cryptocurrency transactions, existing platforms tend to only allow purchase of NFTs using cryptocurrency. Since India does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender, this would be considered an exchange, rather than a sale. This would mean that even non-resident buyers of NFTs, and not just sellers, could be liable to tax based on the criteria described above.\n\nBusiness income\n\nNon-residents who deal with VDAs by running exchanges, through mining or engaging in the business of their trade would come under this category. Where there is a DTAA, the business must have a “permanent establishment” (PE) in India to be taxed here. A PE is understood as assigning a geographical fixity with the state that seeks to tax income. Thus, it excludes auxiliary or preparatory functions, such as storage of goods. However, for e-commerce, servers are considered PE, being primary and not auxiliary to maintaining the decentralised network. This isn’t unprecedented with the Authority for Advanced Rulings previously affirming the formation of PE through servers. Yet, decentralisation across servers as well as complications related to server size,[ii] may make this a suboptimal standard. One possibility here is to extend the equalisation levy, applicable to e-commerce platforms, to traders, miners and exchanges of VDAs, as was also proposed by the CBDT in November 2022. \n\nIn the absence of DTAAs, the standard of “significant economic presence” would be applicable. While both the threshold based on aggregate transaction value and minimum number of users in India could be applied to bring non-resident exchanges to tax, the former alone could be applied to trading and mining businesses. The use of a user-based standard has also been proposed by scholars like Prof. De Wilde, who advocate for a change in the approach to taxing the digital economy from a supply-side perspective, focussed on location of the business, its employees, and resources, to the destination of goods and services instead. This standard is specifically useful to tax VDA exchanges, considering that consumers of such platforms, especially retail traders, are “immobile” in the sense that they are unlikely to shift tax jurisdictions to simply evade tax liability. Further, as discussed earlier, traceability to IP addresses of users can help determine whether such quantitative thresholds have been met, making enforceability of such a standard also feasible. \n\nNFT creators can also earn royalties on every sale transaction of their asset. In general, the treatment of such royalties falls under Section 9(1)(vi), where the NFT is for a business purpose carried on in India or transferred to a resident. For instance, an NFT created from the live performance of an artist in India, sold in India would be taxable, but not if sold abroad. Owing to the vast possibilities of assets underlying NFTs, what is crucial is to determine an Indian nexus for income generation. \n\nIncome from other sources \n\nVDA transactions, including gifts made to non-residents, can come under IOS, as an alternative to being taxed as capital gains. This is argued based on the similarity of the new taxing provision to what is applicable to gambling and lottery winnings under the ITA. Under DTAAs, residuary incomes are usually taxed based on the residence principle, thereby excluding non-residents, unless by some deeming fiction or in connection with a PE (as discussed earlier under business income).\n Conclusion\n\nTo recap, treatment as capital gains would make non-residents located in or having digital wallets in India taxable. This determination can be made based on the IP addresses of the wallet or the non-resident in question. Meanwhile, in case of exchanges, miners and traders, their business income from VDAs would be taxable if they have PE or SEP in India, or alternatively be subjected to an equalisation levy. Treatment as IOS would effectively exclude non-residents under DTAAs, unless they have an Indian PE. Therefore, to balance the state’s taxing interest without being too onerous on non-residents, it is suggested that VDA transactions are treated either under capital gains or as business income, as applicable.\n[i] Amy Held, Private Key v Blockchains: what is a cryptoasset in law?, 4 J. of Intl Banking and Financial Law 247 (2020).\n[ii] Isabelle Beschoor Plug, The Direct Taxation of Cryptocurrency Tokens in National and International Situations (2020) (Masters Thesis, University of Amsterdam) https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=c2137693. \nIncome-Tax ActVirtual Digital AssetsTaxationCryptocurrencyNon-Fungible Tokens\nTaxation Law\n345 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "The Upcoming Financial Regulatory Framework under the DDP",
        "content": "Varuni Tewary\nMar 15\n7 min read\nThe Upcoming Financial Regulatory Framework under the DDP\n[Varuni is a student at Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar.]\n\nIndia has proposed the latest Digital Data Protection Bill 2022 (DDP or Bill).  Through this Bill, it has endeavoured to secure the ambit of digital data before proceeding with legislation encapsulating the entire data protection regime. However, it would be untrue to state that digital data is an unregulated territory. Apart from sectoral regulators, there are several central legislations that regulate digital data. \n\nThe framework for the protection of digital data currently is governed through the Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act) along with rules and regulations framed under the Act. The IT Act along with the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules 2011 (SPDI Rules) categorises financial data as sensitive personal data. Accordingly, corporates dealing with such kind of data are required to keep a basic minimum standard of privacy and ask the data provider for their consent by clearly providing the reasons for collecting the data. As far as the transfer of data to third parties under the SDPI Rules was concerned, it required the transferee to follow a similar standard of protection as standardized under the rules. \n\nIn the current rubrics, there is a lack of a standardized regulator in the area of data protection. This creates hurdles to the implementation of data protection rules as they are inconsistent. Therefore, the various sector regulators have taken it upon themselves to regulate the flow of data in their respective jurisdictions. Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, and Reserve Bank India have framed rules that need to be complied with by the organizations that fall within their purview. \n\nIn an effort to curb these problems, the stakeholders called upon the government to legislate an all-encompassing law for data protection. After several failed attempts, the government proposed the DDP. The present article attempts to look at the regulatory framework for the financial sector in the upcoming data privacy regime.\n\nCURRENT DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR\n\nIn the case of the financial sector, the RBI acts as the sector regulator for the Banks and Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFC) and all kinds of other miscellaneous and residuary financial companies. In the absence of data protection laws, the RBI also acts as the enforcer of data protection guidelines in the sector. In this regard, the RBI has come up with various guidelines for the protection of financial data. These include the Master Directions on KYC, Master Circular on Customer Service Banks, Master Circular on the Issuance of Credit and Debit Cards and many other such directives. \n\nMany of these directions have been made keeping in mind the requirement of the financial institutions and the need to protect the customers of this sector. Some directions are far more complicated than the SDPI rules. As recently as 2021, the RBI, in its circular on data storage by payment aggregators, makes it mandatory from June 2022 to shift to tokenisation technology that bars the entities involved in the payment chain apart from the card networks from storing actual card details. Earlier, in March 2020, the Guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways (Aggregator Rules) had mandated the payment aggregators to implement data security standards, prescribing thereunder, the requirement of cyber security audit and reports and framing IT policy. These directions have had a major impact as increased compliance costs for lending startups. Even several major merchants expressed concerns about the limitations of the payments network for tokenisation and its impact on consumer payment experiences. Previously, merchants were able to store card numbers to inform customers about available offers, but this will no longer be possible with tokenisation.\n\nA challenge faced since the privatisation of banks has been the lack of penetration of formal lending in the interiors of India. However, today there are various new-age players in the lending sector catering to the unbanked populations. A major hurdle for these institutions is that they have to navigate a complex regulatory framework whilst expanding their businesses. Through the Digital Lending Guidelines 2022, it is mandatory for lending applications to report their collected data with the Credit Information Companies. The NBFCs also need to comply with the 2017 framework that requires them to deploy IT infrastructure on operations, cyber security and outsourcing. These steps have been taken to make sure that the RBI is aware of any misappropriation or misuse of data. However, it has further increased compliance costs for lending startups and made it obligatory for them to transfer lending contracts from their platform business to their NBFCs.\n\nTHE DPP AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR\n\nThe Bill is aimed at solving the issues of data protection and providing a united general framework of protection. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has stated that specialized notifications issued by sector regulators will take precedence over the provisions of the Bill, which leads to ambiguity in certain areas. A series of discrepancies emerge as we move from sector to sector as these are regulated by different bodies. \n\nThe earlier version of the Bill, i.e. the Personal Data Protection Bill 2018, included the provision of having a memorandum of understanding with the sector regulators and demarcating the areas of regulation and control. The Bill along with several other earlier rules has created inconsistencies resulting in a complex regulatory structure. In the scheme of the present framework, there is a multiplicity of authorities creating a structure that mandates parallel compliance with several authorities. This is extremely difficult to achieve for startups and MSMEs. Most start-ups have limited resources to spare and having multiple regulators increases compliance costs for small businesses. The Bill envisages creating a system that can lead to hindrances in the development of the digital market and can seriously affect the startup ecosystem. Small businesses have already demanded relaxed rules and larger time frames to comply with the new set of rules imposed by watchdogs, like CERT-In.\n\nIn the earlier versions of the data protection bill, a heavily criticised move was the localisation of the data. In the current framework, the government has dropped this controversial clause. However, due to the lack of sector uniformity in the bill, relief from these restrictions would not be available to most verticals in the financial sector. As per the Aggregator Rules, along with other directions, it is required by all banks and payment system providers to localise payment transaction data in India and restrict the storage of such data outside of India. The underlying rationale is that India loses control over such sensitive data when stored abroad and resultant increase in the possibility of a data breach. It is important to note here that data localisation in all instances does not guarantee security and privacy, but it does allow for more stringent regulatory oversight only when the encryption keys are available in India. \n\nThere are certain instances where there are similar authorities created through the Bill. For instance, the Bill makes it compulsory to appoint consent managers. These consent managers are to be registered with the Data Protection Board. Yet again, in the case of the financial sector, the rules on Account Aggregators, are in reality consent managers who also handle data portability. Yet another instance is that the grievance redressal system as envisaged under the DDP regime allows one to approach the authority within 7 days of the non-acknowledgement of the authority whereas under the newly created ombudsman regime of the RBI, a customer can approach the authority only after 30 days of the non-receipt from the institution.\n\nThe present framework has the potential to create an environment that can lead to considerable resource consumption of economic policymakers and hamper market development. A fragmented set of regulators has created problems the world over, including in the USA. In the absence of a federal law on data protection, multiple legislations and bodies govern data. They come with their distinct compliance requirements that create confusion and hinder the process of financial inclusivity. It has been noted by the Financial Stability Institute’s research that developed countries instead of having specialised agencies, have a single regulatory model when it comes to the financial sector. Experts have opined that in countries like India, where Central Banks are independent bodies, it would make much more sense to have the central bank assume a greater role in regulation than the other bodies. \n\nCurrently, the NBFC structure is reaching out to the unbanked sections of society. Undoubtedly, there is increased evidence of predatory marketing by using the unawareness of these populations. While privacy will only be ensured through these compliance mechanisms, it is also important to underline that at most times privacy breaches are a result of a human handling error. The multiplicity of authorities only creates more difficulty when it comes to securing data and ensuring privacy. There is a need to come up with a regulatory infrastructure that allows for the continuous transfer of data and coordination. In the case of financial institutions, there is a need to understand and prioritise the health of the new age; startups that are totally dependent on data to oil their machinery.\n\nPerhaps, the right way of enforcing the mechanism would be to step into a structure similar to the sandbox run by the RBI. The regulatory sandbox is a system where the institutions can develop products and test them with less regulatory burden. The technique has been successful in guiding the new age fintechs in terms of making the right innovation while keeping the interest of the consumer at the centre. The regulator has also stood benefitted to understand that at times regulations act as a hindrance to the growth of the industry. Creating a coordinated sandbox collaboration between authorities can help reduce duplicity and confusion for entities in the sector. There is sufficient support to show that in spaces where there is a need for regulatory framework without hindering the ease of doing business, sandboxing systems enable building of sound regulatory practices.\nData ProtectionInformation TechnologyAggregator Rules\nCorporate Law\n205 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Evaluating Balram Garg: Changing the landscape of Insider Trading Laws",
        "content": "Sharun Salvi, Kiara Dsouza\nMar 8\n6 min read\nEvaluating Balram Garg: Changing the landscape of Insider Trading Laws\n[Sharun and Kiara are students at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nA recent ruling of the Supreme Court (Court) has fundamentally altered the acceptable criteria for adducing evidence in insider trading cases. In the landmark case of Balram Garg v. SEBI (Balram Garg), the Court delved into the intricacies surrounding the burden of proof imposed upon the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nTo understand the significance of this decision, it is imperative to familiarize oneself with the concept of insider trading and the associated burden of proof. Insider trading is proscribed under the provisions of Section 12-A(e) of the SEBI Act and the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015 (PIT Regulations). These laws effectively restrict individuals who possess unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) from engaging in securities transactions. An individual is deemed to be an insider if they are affiliated with a company and have access to UPSI. For the purposes of this discussion, it is crucial to appreciate that SEBI is required to demonstrate that an individual was in possession of such sensitive information.\n\nThis article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the Court's ruling in Balram Garg. It delves into the decision's implications and the shortcomings of the current legal framework that the ruling endeavours to rectify. Finally, the article evaluates the Court's judgment in light of similar rulings issued by foreign jurisdictions. \n\nUnderstanding Balram Garg\n\nThe Balram Garg case concerned insider trading allegations within the company, P.C. Jewellers. Two brothers, P.C. Gupta and Balram Garg served as the Chairman and the Managing Director for the company, respectively. SEBI accused three family members, Sachin Gupta, Shivani Gupta, and Amit Garg, of trading in the company's shares through a holding company while being in possession of UPSI. The UPSI pertained to the company's announcement of a buyback of particular securities, which was later cancelled due to a lack of consent from the other party.\n\nSEBI argued that the three individuals gained access to the UPSI through their proximity to Mr Gupta and Mr Garg, and claimed that both qualified as a \"connected person\" and \"insider\" under the PIT Regulations. The Securities Appellate Tribunal and the SEBI found the three individuals guilty of insider trading, but the Court overturned this ruling. The Court posed two central questions: \n\n1) Whether the individuals were disconnected from the source of the UPSI? \n2) Whether circumstantial evidence amounts to a sufficient criterion to classify a party as an insider?\n\nThe Court evaluated the relationship between the alleged insiders and communicators of the information while addressing the first issue. It determined that the parties were estranged in their personal and professional lives, making it highly unlikely for any UPSI communication to have taken place. The Court's assessment of the second question is pivotal in this matter. This ruling fundamentally impacted the evidentiary burden in insider trading cases by clarifying that patterns of trade and timing of trade cannot serve as the sole basis for determining an individual's status as an \"insider\". The Court found a lack of correlation between the UPSI and the trading patterns and stated that the decisions to sell shares and the timing thereof were purely personal and commercial in nature.\n\nConsequently, the Court ruled that circumstantial evidence cannot be used to establish the existence of communication between the tipper and the tippee. Direct evidence such as letters, emails, and witnesses testifying to the parties' proximity must be presented to reach such a conclusion.\n\nFilling the Gaps in the Law: Understanding the Jurisprudence\n\nTo appraise the significance of the Court's decision in Balram Garg, it is important to consider the evolving standard for evidence in insider trading cases. Historically, direct evidence in such cases has been rare, leading the courts to adopt a lower standard. The “prudent man's evaluation” of the case circumstances has been deemed crucial. The Sodhi Committee also emphasized that if direct evidence is lacking, the examination of the facts and circumstances of the case should determine access to UPSI. The judgment in SEBI v. Kishore R. Ajmera (Kishore Ajmera) established that circumstantial evidence can suffice in establishing insider trading if it creates an “irresistible inference” of information being conveyed between parties. Reliance was placed on trade patterns, the timing of the trade, and the volume and frequency of orders to make this determination. This viewpoint was strengthened in SEBI v. Rakhi Trading, where circumstantial evidence was held to be acceptable when direct evidence is absent.\n\nCourts have since employed circumstantial evidence to build a presumption of guilt based on the entirety of the surrounding facts and circumstances, rather than simply one isolated occurrence. Kishore Ajmera outlined the broad strokes of handling circumstantial evidence with caution and restraint. However, despite this, courts have relied on incomplete and objectionable facts to hold parties guilty. Cases such as Deep Industries and Scrip of CRISIL have exemplified courts' discretionary interpretation of standards when evaluating circumstantial evidence. In Deep Industries, reliance was placed on Facebook likes to establish USPI sharing and proximity, whereas in the Scrip of CRISIL, only trading patterns and volume of trade were considered without any direct evidence of communication between the parties. This highlights that, despite the established standard for evaluating circumstantial evidence, courts may still exercise discretion in their interpretation.\n\nThe Court's ruling in Balram Garg has a significant impact on the application of circumstantial evidence in cases of insider trading. The decision aims to set a higher bar for evidence, to prevent instances where regulators win cases based on insufficient coincidental evidence without any direct proof of communication. The Court has now mandated the requirement for direct evidence, rather than leaving it to the Courts' discretion to interpret the strength of the circumstantial evidence chain. These instances of having a lower bar and condemning parties for the tiniest of coincidences would have a “chilling effect” on the market. Parties would prefer not to participate in the market for fear of getting into trouble. The Court has accurately interpreted Regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations, putting an end to the previous abuse of circumstantial evidence as a basis for guilt.\n\nPedestalizing Direct Evidence: A Step Too Far?\n\nWhile the Court merits applause for enhancing the burden of proof on the regulator, it has to be criticized for going too far. By laying down the demand of “producing cogent materials” of communication of the USPI, it has failed to understand the ground reality that it is challenging for authorities to gather direct evidence. The current technological advancements make it difficult to obtain direct evidence, and from a practical standpoint, the regulators rely on circumstantial evidence such as patterns in the market to identify misconduct. Imposing the bar too high by only accepting direct evidence would also hinder the efforts made by regulators to maintain market integrity. The Court's decision needs to account for the difficulties faced by regulators in obtaining direct evidence.\n\nForeign jurisdictions have also grappled with the standard of “appropriate evidence” in insider trading cases. For instance, the US Securities Exchange Commission has faced criticism for its low threshold for admissible evidence. A recent ruling emphasized the need for more direct evidence to support a connection, highlighting a growing recognition of this legal principle. Meanwhile, in Canada, the case of Donna v. Hutchinson emphasized the importance of direct evidence, but also acknowledged that circumstantial evidence can play a role in filling “evidentiary gaps”. The court stated that final conclusions must be based on clear and convincing evidence, and regulators must consider all relevant circumstances in a balanced manner between direct evidence and the preponderance of probability.\n\nProving the tipper-tippee relationship has been a thorn in the shoes of enforcement agencies all over. Establishing a cogent link to the passing of information is the key to convicting a party of insider trading. Consequently, the author maintains that the actions must be considered in their entirety, in light of the surrounding circumstances. The Court should have adopted a balanced approach, raising the standard of evidence, whilst allowing the use of circumstantial evidence to fill any evidentiary gaps. Using actions in isolation would harm traders; however, enabling circumstantial evidence to be stitched together like a mosaic would preserve a firm threshold while also allowing the regulator to detect illicit activity in the securities market.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe author argues that the Court must take a balanced approach while evaluating evidence when dealing with complex issues such as insider trading. The author believes that the Court's decision, in this case, was appropriate in terms of the burden of proof, but the undervaluation of circumstantial evidence was a misstep. This argumentative sanctuary is critical for regulators because other options are rarely available. The author suggests that courts should consider the entire chain of circumstances and the overall context of the situation instead of relying on isolated pieces of evidence such as emails or phone calls. Adopting this approach will enhance the quality of investigations and protect traders and investors without having a “chilling effect” on the market. This decision will prompt SEBI and other regulatory bodies to reassess their investigation, prosecution, and penalty strategies that contribute significantly to the current quandary.\nSupreme CourtInsider TradingSEBIUPSI\nCorporate Law\n584 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Beyond the Transaction: (Mis)application of the Principle Purpose Test",
        "content": "Sharun Salvi\nMar 6\n6 min read\nBeyond the Transaction: (Mis)application of the Principle Purpose Test\n[Sharun is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nBilateral tax treaties and double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAA) are widely used to negotiate taxing rights between treaty partners. They offer tax benefits and exemptions to parties and are increasingly utilized to redirect tax jurisdiction from one country to a tax haven through base erosion and profit shifting. To address this issue, India has approved the OECD Action Plan 15, providing for a multilateral instrument (MLI) to counteract such abuse. According to Article 7 of the MLI, if it is clear from the facts and circumstances of the case that obtaining tax benefits was one of the primary reasons of the transaction, the transaction would not be covered by the treaty. Moreover, India has implemented General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) under domestic law, targeting impermissible avoidance arrangements (IAA) with the primary goal of obtaining a treaty benefit.\n\nThe article analyzes the confrontational approach of the tax authority towards foreign investment in India through the examination of relevant cases, focusing on the threshold for the principle purpose test (PPT) and the inconsistent standard for judgment. The author aims to examine the misapplication of these standards to the Adani-Holcim transaction in light of contemporary precedents. \n\nUnderstanding the Threshold \n\nThe Tiger Global case\n\nTiger Global LLC is a private equity firm registered in Mauritius that held shares of Flipkart Private Limited in Singapore from 2011 to 2015. In 2018, Tiger Global sold its 162,43,010 shares in Flipkart Singapore to a Luxembourg corporation, S.A.R.L. However, the tax authorities ruled that the transaction was not eligible for tax benefits under the Indo-Mauritius DTAA as it was determined that the company was merely a front for tax evasion and true control was exercised in the United States.[1]\n\nIt is important to note that the SC, through the Azadi Bachao Andolan case in 2000, gave its blessing to such corporate structures. It upheld the validity of the Circular 789, which stated that a tax residency certificate (TRC) issued by the Government of Mauritius was sufficient proof of a company's eligibility for DTAA benefits. Despite possessing a TRC, the Indian tax authority did not issue a nil withholding certificate for Tiger Global.\n\nThe Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) disregarded precedents and Circular 789, opting to establish its own standards instead. It pierced the corporate veil, ruling that Tiger Global was merely a \"see-through\" entity for tax benefits, as the \"head and brain\" of the company was not in Mauritius. Additionally, the AAR considered the absence of other investments by Tiger Global as evidence of its intention to take advantage of the DTAA.\n\nThis case shows how the AAR has disregarded the TRC and considered other factors. \n\nThe Bidvest Holdings case\n\nThe AAR in the case of Bid Services Division (Mauritius) Ltd, In re, demonstrated a comparable line of reasoning to that in the Tiger Global case but went further. The Bid Services (Mauritius) was a subsidiary of the Bid Services Division Ltd, held by the South Africa-incorporated Bidvest Group. The TRC was issued by the Mauritian authorities, and the assessee had its place of effective management in Mauritius. The issue arose in 2011 when the assessee sold 13.5% of its shares in Mumbai International Airport Private Limited. The AAR upheld its \"substance over form\" argument and considered the following:\nThe timeline of the original purchase was important. The assessee was incorporated two weeks before the submission of the bid and was not  originally a part of the bid.\nThe special purpose vehicle (SPV) of the Bidvest Group. Its incorporation in Mauritius indicates a lack of commercial substance or business purpose.\nThe funding source for the shares was the holding parent entities.\nIn addition to these points, the AAR rejected the assessee's argument that the SPV was used in Mauritius as it is a common commercial practice in an efficient investment jurisdiction.\n\nBased on the aforementioned cases, several key elements can be gleaned for evaluating the principle purpose of a transaction. These considerations include:\nthe corporate structure and location of effective management;\nthe timing and establishment of the assessee and its commercial viability; and\nthe legitimacy of the entity including its employees, funds and investments. \nDifferent Standards for Adani? \n\nThe author demonstrated how the PPT standards have been framed for cross-border transactions in the previous section. The paper will now examine the uniform applicability of these principles by evaluating the Adani-Holcim deal.\n\nOwnership structure \n\nIn 2022, the Adani group acquired Ambuja Cements and ACC from the Holcim group for $6.38 billion and this has been completely tax free. On one side we have the Holcim Group which is incorporated in the Netherlands. It holds Holderfin B.V., which in turn holds Holderind Investments. The latter is incorporated in Mauritius, holding 63.20% and 4.48 shares in Ambuja Cements Limited and ACC Limited, respectively. Ambuja Cements Limited further holds 50.05% shares in ACC Limited. On the other side, we have the Adani Group that owns Acropolis Trade and Investment Limited, which in turn owns Xcent Trade and Investment Limited, which is further owned by Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited. The latter entity has acquired Holderind Investments Limited.\n\nApplication of MLI and GAAR\n The litigants maintain that, in light of the Indo-Netherlands DTAA, Article 13(5) of the treaty comes into effect and absolves the seller from any liabilities in regards to capital gains tax. Additionally, they posit that the DTAA takes precedence over national tax legislation.\n\nAn evaluation of Articles 6 and 7 of the MLI and the provisions of GAAR in the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act) reveals that if the primary aim of the transaction is to gain tax benefits, the tax authorities are empowered to examine the underlying substance of the transaction, as has been upheld in the judgements cited above. Furthermore, Section 90(2A) of the Act stipulates that the provisions of Chapter X-A of the Act, including GAAR, shall be enforceable, thereby overriding the DTAA.\n\nIn accordance with Section 96(1) of the Act, the tax authorities have the discretion to take action against anything that could be classified as an IAA. As per Section 96(1)(c), one of the grounds for this action is a lack of commercial substance, as defined in Section 97 of the Act.\n\nAssessing the commercial substance under Section 97\n\nUnder Section 97, a transfer lacks commercial substance, if it involves a transaction or place of residence of a party that has no substantial commercial benefit other than receiving a tax incentive. The author shall demonstrate this through the following considerations:\n\nThe corporate structure \n\nThe Adani Group's organizational architecture is structured in a hierarchical fashion, characterized by multiple layers of subsidiary corporations and a special purpose vehicle, but without any substantive commercial connection to the operations of the enterprise. Furthermore, the Hindenberg Report disclosed that the three subsidiary firms are nominal entities bereft of any corporate essence. Upon examination, it was found that these entities are devoid of both web presence and publicly disclosed personnel, including managers and employees. By utilizing the criterion established in the Tiger Global case, one can infer that these entities lack any tangible presence in the transaction, thereby providing the Taxman with a cogent basis to take enforcement action.\n\nLegitimacy of the entity \n\nThe purchaser, Endeavour Investments and Trades, was established on 29 April 2021, a mere two weeks prior to the acquisition. Furthermore, the transaction will not be funded by Endeavour Investments' own resources, but rather by capital infused by Adani and debt obtained from overseas banks. In light of the principles regarding temporal considerations established in the Bidvest case, it is manifest that the tax authorities have the discretion to examine the legitimacy and participation of this entity in the bidding process.\n\nCommon commercial practices \n\nMoreover, the employment of an SPV and the execution of a commercial transaction in a tax-haven jurisdiction ought to be scrutinized in accordance with the precedential norms. \n\nThus, this part accentuates the labyrinthine taxation quandaries posed by this transaction. Through this critical analysis, it is clear that the norms imposed upon other cases have not been adhered to in the Adani-Holcim acquisition.\n\nConclusion \n\nThe primary aim of this paper is to analyze the criteria established by the tax authority for evaluating the PPT in cross-border transactions. Through the examination of the cases of Tiger Global and Bidvest Holdings, the paper highlights some recurring considerations utilized by the AAR. \n\nIt delves deeper into the Adani-Holcim deal to reveal deficiencies in its corporate structure and the purpose of the assessee's incorporation. The deal raises issues similar to the concerns raised in the Tiger Global case regarding its corporate structure. Additionally, it raises questions about the temporal aspects of the deal and provides strong evidence of it being a mere vehicle for tax avoidance. These actions are comparable to those of Bidvest Holdings, yet the latter transaction has managed to evade scrutiny.\n\nIt is evident from these cases that the tax authority's approach to determining the substance of a transaction is subjective, leading to selective enforcement and increasing the likelihood of litigation. This subjectivity will also discourage foreign investment, and the government must act promptly to bring clarity to the law and end this arbitrary approach by the tax authority.\n[1] Tiger Global International II Holdings, In re, (2020) 116 taxmann.com 878 (AAR) (New Delhi). \nDTAATaxationAARTax AvoidancePrinciple Purpose\nTaxation Law\n137 views\n2 likes.

        "content": "Sampoorna Chatterjee\nMar 4\n7 min read\nExoneration in Inquiry and Subsequent Discharge in Criminal Proceedings: A Brain-teasing Discourse\n[Sampoorna is a student at Amity University, Kolkata.]\n\nWhile it is a settled position of law that being acquitted in a criminal case will not debar the employer from subjecting the delinquent employee to disciplinary proceedings on the same set of charges, the converse of this, i.e., whether a person exonerated in departmental proceedings would automatically be discharged in criminal proceedings, seems unsettled. \n\nCourts across India – both the Supreme Court and the High Courts – have, time and again, given contrasting decisions on this question of law, and the Delhi High Court’s judgment in Ashish Chauhan v. State (Government of NCT of Delhi) and Another is just another addition to the list. In this case, the court held that if the internal committee (IC) of an organization set up under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013 had given a clean chit to the accused persons, any criminal proceeding on the same charges could not be sustained in law.\n\nCases like this have arisen in the past and have attracted significant criticism owing to the distinctive nature of criminal proceedings and disciplinary inquiries. This article attempts to highlight these rulings and the fallacies that are inherent therein.\n\nBackground of the Judgment \n\nThe respondent was working as a legal trainee at the Head Office of Maruti Suzuki India Limited and was allegedly sexually harassed by the petitioners who were her seniors from the legal department. The petitioners purportedly passed lewd comments, used abusive language, stared at her in a sexually offending manner, and tried to touch her without her consent, and one of them even allegedly offered her to come to his place for drinks. Despite taking up the issue with her seniors at the workplace, no concrete action was taken, as per the respondent. Further, as per the respondent’s version, instead of referring the matter to the IC, her seniors asked her to quit since the company was not going to act against its permanent employees. \n\nPost this, she filed an FIR under Sections 354A and 506 of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Aggrieved, the petitioners approached the High Court of Delhi under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (CrPC) seeking quashing of the FIR and the proceedings arising therefrom.\n\nThe question of law before the High Court was to determine whether the petitioners, after having been exonerated in the disciplinary proceedings, could be involved in criminal proceedings on the same set of facts involving identical charges.\n\nThe court relied on Ashoo Surendranath Tewari v. Deputy Superintendent Police, EOW, CBI, 2020 (Surendranath) and P.S. Rajya v. State of Bihar, 1996 (P.S. Rajya) to answer in the negative. In Surendranath, the Supreme Court while making a reference to Radhesyam Kejriwal v. State of West Bengal  (Kejriwal), observed that if a person is exonerated in disciplinary proceedings on technical grounds as against on the merits of the matter, criminal proceedings may continue. Conversely, if the exoneration is on merit, criminal proceedings cannot be continued. It was so because criminal proceedings demand a higher degree of proof compared to a departmental inquiry. Similarly, in P.S. Rajya, since the charges were one and the same in both the proceedings and the respondent had not disputed the results of the departmental inquiry, the Supreme Court had quashed the criminal proceedings. \n\nBasis the above, the court quashed the FIR against the petitioners.\n\nCriminal Proceedings vis-à-vis Disciplinary Inquiries\n\nThe primary point of distinction between criminal proceedings and disciplinary inquiries is the degree of proof required to establish guilt. Criminal proceedings require the guilt to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, i.e., the prosecution needs to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise the accused shall be acquitted. On the other hand, departmental proceedings are based on the concept of preponderance of probabilities, i.e., the probability of the happening will determine its existence. \n\nApart from the differing standards of proof, the objectives, the governing rules, the methods of inquiry, and the rules of evidence are also different for the two. In the case of Ajit Kumar Nag v. G.M.(P.J.)Indian Oil, the Supreme Court drew a distinction between the two by clarifying that in disciplinary proceedings, the endeavour is to ascertain the guilt of the accused and impose punishment basis the applicable service rules, whereas in criminal proceedings, it is to inflict appropriate punishment. While a disciplinary inquiry concerns itself with an employee’s misconduct at the organisational level, criminal proceedings are conducted to inquire into matters which are a wrong against the society as a whole. \n\nTherefore, given the distinctive nature of the two, the author finds it farcical for the findings of a departmental proceeding to have a bearing on the criminal proceedings. Even in Iqbal Singh Marwah v. Meenakshi Marwah, the Supreme Court had held that the findings of a civil court will neither have a bearing on nor be binding upon the proceedings of a criminal court. \n\nConflicting Jurisprudence \n\nOn the question of whether exoneration in departmental proceedings would automatically terminate the criminal proceedings, the Supreme Court itself seems to have a divided opinion. The High Courts have followed a similar suit. Inconsistency in judicial decisions runs counter to both fairness towards litigants and uniformity in judicial decision-making, resultantly making the doctrine of precedent unachievable. \n\nIn the P.S. Rajya case, the question of law that arose for consideration was to determine whether the criminal proceedings against the appellant could continue under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 despite his exoneration in the departmental proceedings through the report of the Central Vigilance Commission. The decision was in the negative, i.e., it was held that once a person is exonerated in departmental proceedings, criminal prosecution against him cannot be continued on identical charges. Further, it reiterated the case scenarios from State of Haryana and Others v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Others under which the court could exercise its power under Article 226 read with Section 482 of the CrPC to quash an FIR for the purposes of preventing the abuse of process of court or to reach the ends of justice. \n\nThe Bombay High Court, in the case of Keshav v. State of Maharashtra, relying on the Surendranath case, quashed the FIR basis the fact that the accused had been exonerated in the disciplinary proceedings conducted on identical/similar charges. Since the results of the departmental proceedings were in favour of the accused, the very basis on which the criminal complaint was filed was quashed. Further, it was held that if the criminal proceedings were continued, it would amount to an abuse of the process of court. \n\nPer contra, in Rajendra Kumar Gautam v. State of Madhya Pradesh, where the High Court of Madhya Pradesh was entrusted to answer the question on whether the results of a departmental inquiry would preclude the prosecution from filing an FIR, it was observed that despite the accused being exonerated in the departmental inquiry, the FIR could not be quashed. It was noted that in case of exoneration on merits, the subsequent quashing of FIR was not a thumb rule.\n\nSimilarly, in State of N.C.T. of Delhi v. Ajay Kumar Tyagi (Ajay Tyagi), the Supreme Court had reiterated the stance taken in State v. M. Krishna Mohan (Krishna Mohan), and observed that quashing of FIR was not an ipso facto outcome of exoneration in departmental proceedings. Further adding to the same, it clarified that while it is true that when the very basis on which the prosecution was initiated is set aside by a higher authority, the prosecution must not be continued with. However, this rule is not applicable in cases concerning departmental and criminal proceedings given that a criminal trial and a departmental proceeding are conducted by two separate entities and are not in the same hierarchy. \n\nAn important observation made in the Krishna Mohan judgment was that the P. S. Rajya judgement was based on the peculiar facts of the case and as such, could not have been taken to be an “authority” for the purposes of proposing that exoneration in departmental proceedings would ipso facto result in acquittal in criminal case. \n\nTherefore, in a nutshell, while some judgments propose that if the charges are not sufficiently backed by evidence in an inquiry demanding a lower standard of proof, they would certainly not be supported by evidence under an inquiry requiring a higher standard of proof; on the other hand, others have highlighted the distinctive nature of two to keep them separate. \n\nComments\n\nFrom the above discussion, the author has attempted to make it clear that the position of law on the subject is, indeed, unrefined. It is further compounded by the inconsistency in the approach of the highest court of India – the Supreme Court.\n  When the Supreme Court of India takes a contrasting view on a particular question of law, the courts that are subordinate to it are required to make a preference between those views. Thus, when confronted, one view is to be bound by the judgment that was rendered later in time, while the other view is to choose the one that befits the factual circumstances of the case at hand. The High Court of Orissa in Dr. Minaketan Pani v. State of Orissa held that the ruling in Surendranath, having been rendered later in time, would prevail. On the other hand, the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir in Sarwan Singh v. State, following the suit of Ajay Tyagi, did not exonerate the petitioner from criminal proceedings despite him being absolved of all charges in the disciplinary enquiry.\n\nWhile it may seem that the answer lies in one of the two judgements of Surendranath and Ajay Tyagi, it so appears that courts have (see here and here) highlighted the infirmities in them, too. While Ajay Tyagi was per incuriam since it had failed to take into consideration the Coordinate Bench ruling in Kejriwal which it was supposed to be bound by, the Surendranath judgment had not engaged with the Ajay Tyagi judgment. Sinceper incuriam judgments do not have a precedent value, courts must, therefore, cautiously adjudicate matters that cite such cases as leading references. \n\nIn conclusion, this inconsistent position requires to be clarified through a decision of a larger bench of the Supreme Court of India, but till then, the position will remain muddled and every next decision on this issue will only dilute the discourse.\nInquiryCriminalEmploymentMisconduct\nLabour Law\n918 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "The ‘Fit and Proper’ Onus – A Sufficient Defence Against Hostile Takeovers?",
        "content": "Shikhar\nMar 2\n6 min read\nThe ‘Fit and Proper’ Onus – A Sufficient Defence Against Hostile Takeovers?\n[Shikhar is a student at National Law School of India University, Bangalore.]\n\nOn 16 January 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued Master Directions on the Acquisition and Holding of Shares or Voting Rights in Banking Companies (Directions). Section 4.1 of the Directions requires any person seeking to acquire major shareholding in a banking company to submit an application to the RBI. Further, by operation of Section 4.3, this application would be proffered to the concerned banking company’s board of directors to deliberate on the application and assign a ‘fit and proper’ status of the intending acquirer.\n\nThis article demonstrates that the onus of assigning a ‘fit and proper’ status being on the concerned banking company would act as a hostile takeover defense in and of itself. Further, a lacuna in the Directions will also be highlighted through which possible hostile takeover bids could be made via the ‘proxy fight’ strategy. \n\nBy way of clarification, this article will be dealing with private sector banks in particular, as private-sector banks have majority of the shares held by private individuals and institutions, while public-sector banks have majority shares held by the government. This makes the shareholding pattern qualitatively different. Therefore, the modalities of standard takeover strategies and defenses would differ substantially. \n\nDesirability of Regulatory Restraints on Hostile Takeovers\n\nHostile takeover bids have also been dubbed ‘disciplinary takeovers’ as instances of mismanagement, bad corporate governance practices and shareholder neglect are generally brought to the fore in the process of a bid. Even unsuccessful bids tend to double as ‘wake-up calls’ to instances of mismanagement in a company. Attempts at takeovers also put the internal governance mechanisms of the company to the test. With ever-increasing instances of mismanagement within private-sector banks, such measures could have positive outcomes in terms of efficiency in banking operations and streamlining of workforce. However, the nature of banking services is qualitatively different from most other sectors. A takeover or an acquisition, if unsuccessful, messy or uninformed, could threaten the stability of the financial system as a whole. The Bank of America acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corporation serves to demonstrate this very point. Having been oblivious to the over-exposure of Countrywide to subprime mortgages, the Bank of America was in for a shock when they went through the books after the acquisition. The entire debacle lost them a substantial amount of money, shareholder trust and had an impact on the global financial system during the financial crisis era. Similar issues arose in Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch. As the system is built on customer perception and trust, it is necessary to ensure that any possibility for such destabilizing incidents be mitigated. \n\nThe aforementioned Bank of America acquisitions also serve to bolster the point that takeovers in the banking sector have historically been found to be ineffective owing to the difficulty in valuation. Owing to factors such as information asymmetry, quality of financial reporting and possibility of high leverage exposure, an optimal valuation could be an onerous undertaking. Coupled with the strategy employed during the takeover by the prospective acquirer, the costs may make the acquisition process an unprofitable venture. Such takeovers with high costs could bear heavy on the management and/or on the funds required for undertaking banking operations effectively. These issues make it clear that regulatory frameworks have to be developed and prevent any destabilizing negative externalities arising out of hostile takeovers in the banking/financial system.\n\nThe Onus of ‘Fit and Proper’ as a Takeover Defence\n\nPossibly in pursuance of creating a strong framework, the RBI, through the Directions, requires the board to submit its comments on the proposed acquisition of a major shareholding. This would be through a form which allows for the board to present their opinions on the integrity and reputation of the prospective shareholder, while also soliciting suspicions of a takeover or ‘destabilisation of the management’. Further, the board is also required to assess and determine the ‘fit and proper’ status of the prospective shareholder.  In doing so, the board is allowed to construct the criteria for ‘fit and proper’, although they would have to follow the broad contours of the illustrative criteria given by the RBI. The criteria largely revolve around aspects such as the business record of the prospective shareholder, soundness and feasibility of future plans for development, impact assessment on the management of the banking company, historical conformity with good governance standards and assessment of other individuals/entities that are associated with the body corporate (if the prospective shareholder is a body corporate).\n\nThis makes it clear that the RBI sets out with the intent of limiting, if not erasing, the possibility of hostile takeovers. This move by the RBI could possibly be to prepare a regulated environment in anticipation of imminent disinvestment by the government and the consolidation of private sector banks. By giving the board the benefit of the doubt with regards to the board’s takeover suspicions, the RBI has effectively bolstered the takeover defence arsenal of banking companies. However, its effectiveness remains to be seen.\n\nThe Proxy Fight Loophole\n\nThe ‘fit and proper’ standard, largely found in corporate governance jurisprudence, may seem to do well with regards to various hostile takeover strategies like tender offers, but it could fall flat in the face of a proxy fight. \n\nProxy fights/contests are a hostile takeover strategy employed to target dissident directors on a board or to replace existing directors with new ones that would act favourably towards an acquisition by the concerned acquirer. Such a situation is hard to notice, and even if observable, it would be hard to prove. Owing to the latent nature of the hostile takeover regime in India, the Companies Act 2013 and the Competition Act 2002 have not adequately accounted for such a situation, if at all.\n\nFurther, proxy fight strategies, if executed successfully, can disable most takeover defences such as the white knight defence in which a friendly acquirer interrupts the hostile takeover bid by purchasing the target company. It also works to ward off last-resort defences such as the poison pill defence where the shares of the target company are diluted to the extent that it would be unfeasible for the acquirer to take over without paying substantial costs. The reason for the efficacy of the proxy fight strategy lies in one commonality between all such defences – a requirement of board approval for the usage of these defences. As a proxy fight strategy essentially seeks to ‘infiltrate’ the board, these defences would invariably fall flat. Proxy fights have historically been countered through staggered board elections which would make the realisation of the strategy a long-drawn process, thereby rendering them unattractive. However, with the rise in shareholder activism bolstered by the stock-price manipulation scandals/controversies in the recent past, the staggered board approach could be in decline. \n\nIn fact, shareholder activism paves the way for proxy fight strategies to come to fruition. It is because this form of activism targets the corporate governance mechanisms and performance through methods such as investor confrontations and formal interventions. Shareholder activism proceeds primarily with the aim of expressing dissatisfaction with the management or to effectuate change in the internal governance mechanisms. When activism of this kind is exercised, it can unsettle a board, or create dissident directors. This makes shareholder activism another factor that the RBI should necessarily consider if it seeks to mitigate/eradicate possibilities of proxy fights that can result in hostile takeover bids.\n\nFurther, the proxy fight strategy still retains potency in that it may utilise dissident shareholders to remove a director under Section 169 of the Companies Act 2013.  \n\nTherefore, when back-testing the 'fit and proper' onus against proxy fight method of hostile takeovers, it would be noticed that owing to its reliance on the discretion of a board – it would not be able to double as a sufficient defence. Therefore, if the RBI would prefer to avoid this loophole altogether, it needs to work around the issue that most takeover defences such as the white knight, poison pill and the 'fit and proper' standard defences have in common – board discretion. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the inclusion of the ‘fit and proper’ criteria serves to disable most takeover strategies, it does little by way of mitigating hostile takeovers through proxy fights. Internal mechanisms are the only plausible defence against a proxy fight strategy, in the absence of regulation. Proactive engagement with shareholders at regular intervals to ensure shareholder trust in the board is a necessity to dissuade proxy solicitations. If the indicative intent of the RBI in issuing the Directions was to mitigate possibilities of hostile takeovers, it would have to account for shareholder activism and construct a framework that would work to protect against destabilising activities, while also respecting shareholder liberties. \n‘Fit and Proper’RBIMaster DirectionsHostile Takeovers\nCorporate Law\n359 views\n11 likes.

        "title": "Taxability of Cross-Border Secondment Arrangement: Unsettling the Settled",
        "content": "Darshil Sakhia\nFeb 28\n6 min read\nTaxability of Cross-Border Secondment Arrangement: Unsettling the Settled\n[Darshil is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nMultinational entities often share their talent pool with other companies in different jurisdictions for varied purposes through secondment arrangements. In India, these secondment arrangements are structured in a way wherein the seconded employee remains on the payroll of the foreign company in the base location and continues to withdraw salary in that country. However, the Indian counterparts of these companies reimburse such foreign entities for the services of the seconded employees for the duration of the secondment. In India, the issue of taxability in a secondment arrangement has always been a contentious tax issue but was more or less settled in the erstwhile service tax regime. The recent decision of the Supreme Court of India (SC) in Commissioner of Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax, Bangalore (Adjudication) v. Northern Operating Systems Private Limited, is a stark departure from the settled position on taxation of secondment of employees by a foreign entity to its Indian counterpart. The SC held that these secondment arrangements and subsequent reimbursement by Indian entities to their foreign counterparts are ‘in substance’ provision of service and consideration for supply of manpower, and hence taxable in India in the hands of the foreign entities.\n\nIn this article, the author aims to analyse the recent decision of the SC and other court rulings on the taxability of secondment arrangements and the tests employed by the courts to arrive at these decisions. Further, the author shall also discuss the implications of this decision on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.\n\nThe Core Issue\n\nThe core question which needs to be addressed in order determine the taxability of secondment arrangement is the taxability of cross charge and to determine who should be reckoned as an employer of the seconded employees (the Indian entity to which they were seconded or the foreign entity on whose payroll they are employed). The Indian tax authorities have consistently sought to tax the reimbursement by the Indian entity to the foreign counterpart for the secondment of employees on the ground of it being a fee paid for technical service and hence for a ‘supply of manpower’. However, in many of its decisions, the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each case, mostly took a view that the reimbursement by the Indian entity to a foreign entity is not a consideration for the supply of manpower.\n\nThe Decision in Northern Operating Systems\n\nIn the present case, Northern Operating Systems Private Limited (Assessee) entered into a contract with their foreign counterpart to obtain managerial and technical personnel on secondment to assist Indian company in providing required services. These seconded employees were in control and supervision of the Assessee, and to protect their social security interests as well as retirement and health benefits, they remained on payroll of the foreign entity who would be reimbursed by the host entity. Further, on the completion of the secondment period, the employees were required to return to another host country.\n\nThe revenue department contended that the overall reading of the agreement for the secondment of employees, the services agreement and other documents suggested that the arrangement between the Assessee and its foreign counterpart entity is a contract for service. They further contended that the mere fact that the seconded employees were in temporary control and direction of Assessee did not take away the fact the real employer was the foreign counterpart entity, which was providing its services to the Assessee and was getting reimbursement for the same. Therefore, taking all these factors into consideration, the agreement for the secondment of employees was for the supply of service and hence taxable under the Finance Act 1994 (Act).\n\nOn the other hand, the Assessee contended that the scope of the term ‘manpower recruitment and supply agency service’ under Section 65(68) and Section 65(105)(k) of the Act also includes employees who come under their direction and control. Further, they contended that under the negative list under Section 65(44) of the Act, the services provided to the employer by the employee within the scope of employment is out of the ambit of ‘service’ and hence is not taxable.\n\nThe SC observed that all activities carried out by a person for another person was deemed to be services except the excluded categories which included services by an employee to an employer within the relation between employee and employer. The SC carefully looked at the nature of secondment arrangement and observed that though the Assessee exercised temporary control over the employees, the seconded employees were on the payroll of the foreign entity and were to return to their original employer (foreign employer). Further, employees’ terms of employment were also in accordance with the policy of the foreign entity. Therefore, the SC looked at “substance over form” to hold that the Assessee was the recipient of the service by the foreign entity and the foreign entity provided manpower supply service which would be taxable.\n\nControl v/s Legal Relationship\n\nIn the present case, the SC did not take into consideration the operational and the managerial control the Assessee exercised over the seconded employees to assess the arrangement between the employees and the Assessee. Instead, the SC put greater emphasis on the legal relationship between the seconded employees and the foreign entity which continued during the period of secondment. Similarly, the Delhi HC in the case of Centrica India Offshore Private Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax-1 placed more emphasis on the legal relationship between the foreign entity and the seconded employees rather that the existing economic relationship between the Indian entity and the seconded employees. The court observed that the employees during secondment continued to remain the employees of the foreign entity as the direct cost of such employees was borne by such entity. Though the Indian entity had power to terminate the secondment agreement, it did not have the power to terminate the underlying employment agreement.\n\nFurther, in the present case, the contract was one of service rather than a contract for service. The SC in its recent decision in Sushilaben Indravadan Gandhi v. The New India Assurance Company has discussed various tests to distinguish between a contract of service and a contract for service and held that a “conglomerate of all applicable tests taken on the totality of the fact situation in a given case” should be considered to determine whether the contract is for service or of service. Keeping this in consideration, it is clear in the view of the author that the seconded employees were in the effective control of the Assessee and the Assessee was reimbursing the salary expense of the foreign entity. Further, the employees were integrated in the Assessee’s business and were not merely an accessory and, therefore, there was a contract of service and not a contract for service.\n\nThe Karnataka HC in the case of Flipkart Internet Private Limited v. DCIT (International Taxation) has observed that the secondees retained dual employment with both entities. They retained employment with the Indian entity during the period of secondment agreement and therefore any employment before and after secondment is not relevant to determine the secondees’ relationship with the Indian entity during secondment period.\n\nThese rulings emphasise on the need to consider different factors to determine who should be reckoned as an employer of the seconded employees. Keeping all these factors in consideration (legal relationship, autonomy exercised by the seconded employees, extent of the control exercised by the Indian entity, etc.), the present arrangement would, in the view of the author, partake the character of a contract of service and hence would not fall under the definition of ‘service’ under the amended Section 65(44) of the Act by virtue of the specific exclusion of ‘service by an employee to the employer in the course of or in relation to his employment’ under clause (b). \n\nImplications under GST\n\nThe secondment agreements have continued under the GST regime and the present judgement which departed from the earlier settled position will have implications on all such secondment arrangements under the GST regime. Further, the controversies with respect to taxability of secondment arrangements have already arisen under the GST regime as well. The Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling, Tamil Nadu, has, in its one of the decisions, held that the reimbursement paid to the foreign entity by their Indian counterpart towards the salary paid to seconded employees would be covered under ‘supply of service’ and hence GST would be applicable. \n\nWay Forward\n\nThe present judgement of the SC will have significant implications as it, per author’s view, unsettled the settled position on the issue of taxability of cross-border secondment arrangements. Various income tax tribunals in multiple decisions have held that the secondment arrangements are not in the nature of manpower supply service and hence not taxable. This judgement will open the gates for greater scrutiny of secondment arrangements, especially cross-border secondment arrangements, under the GST regime. Therefore, the way forward, in view of the present judgement, for Indian entities is to reassess and restructure their secondment arrangements with their foreign counterpart entity to compute possible tax liability arising out of such secondment arrangements.\nSecondmentEmploymentCross-BorderGSTContract of ServiceContract for Service\nTaxation Law\n461 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Credit Default Swap by AIFs: Demystifying the Regulatory Change",
        "content": "Parv Pancholi\nFeb 19\n6 min read\nCredit Default Swap by AIFs: Demystifying the Regulatory Change\n[Parv is a student at National Law University, Odisha.]\n\nTo the flourishing stride of alternative investment fund (AIF) regime in India, adds another feather in the form of gates for assuming and hedging credit risks. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), through its recent amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 (Regulations) read with the circular dated 12 January 2023, has allowed AIFs to participate in credit default swap (CDS) transactions as protection buyers or protection sellers in the CDS market within certain regulatory limitations. Premised on the successful investment portfolios of AIFs in debt and securitized debt instruments (which account for around 30% of the total investment portfolio of AIFs, as evident here), this amendment is an endeavor to give an impetus to the not-so-successful corporate bond market in India. This article is an attempt to understand the enabling provision with a brief analysis of the same on the Indian market, more so on the Indian corporate bond market.\n\nUnderstanding Alternative Investment Funds\n\nAIFs are privately collected pools of funds that aim to invest in different asset classes including the highly-buzzed-around startups, and publicly traded entities among others. It is an alternative to those classes of investors who are looking for an alternative to the generally volatile stock market instruments and offers diversification in their portfolio. The Regulations provide for three classes of AIFs - Category I, Category II, and Category III AIFs - out of which the first two are more stringently regulated as compared to their third counterpart. The Regulations prohibit Category I funds to leverage while it is partially allowed for operating expenses in the case of Category II funds. However, the same is allowed even for investing when it comes to the Category III of AIF.\n\nWhat is Credit Default Swap?\n\nEmanating from the financial ecosystem of JP Morgan, CDS is a derivative contract that primarily aims to hedge against a credit risk. It is a kind of insurance to a lender (protection buyer) against the defaults of the borrower (referencing entity) in repayment of loans, especially corporate bonds. Such insurance is in lieu of a premium paid to the insurer (protection seller). Earlier, RBI had put in place the master directions with regard to credit derivatives in 2022, which defined CDS as a “credit derivative contract in which one counterparty (protection seller) commits to pay to the other counterparty (protection buyer) in the case of a credit event with respect to a reference entity and in return, the protection buyer makes periodic payments (premium) to the protection seller until the maturity of the contract or the credit event, whichever is earlier.\" The major drivers and players of the CDS market have hitherto been the scheduled commercial banks with a few exceptions like housing finance corporations and NBFCs also playing their role. Though the Indian legal regime allowed CDS quite a long time back, it has largely remained unsuccessful and not so prevalent till now. The proposed amendment is therefore brought to invigorate the CDS by the hands of AIF, categorically, in the Indian corporate bonds.\n\nThe New Norm: Understanding the Change in Law\n\nThe new norm allows Category I and Category II AIFs to buy CDS only for the purposes of hedging risks in underlying investments of debt. However, the new norm allows open hands to Category III funds to buy CDS for hedging as well as for other purposes within the permissible leverage limit, that is, an exposure of CDS not more than two times the net asset value of the fund. The amendment allows Category III AIFs to also sell off their CDS, provided that this 'effective leverage undertaken' is within the specified limits of SEBI. Not only that, but these Category III Funds are also required to earmark government securities at par with their CDS exposure. Similarly, Category II AIFs have also been allowed to sell off their CDS, provided that they earmark government securities equal to their CDS exposure. The SEBI has also made it clear in the new circular that the CDS exposure of an AIF shall not tantamount to leverage. \n\nThe new norm requires that the exposure to an investee company, even through a CDS, should not breach the prescribed concentration limits from SEBI. The market watchdog has also asked the AIFs to report about the CDS transactions to the custodian by the very next working day itself. It also casts a duty of instantaneous reporting (to the custodian) and rectification on Category II and Category III AIFs in case their earmarked securities go below their CDS exposures. \n\nFurther, the change provides that any unhedged position that leads to the gross unhedged positions of all CDS transactions exceeding 25% of the investable funds of the AIF scheme would be taken only after informing all the unit holders of the scheme. Additionally, to avoid prolonged leverage, the Category I and II AIFs transacting in CDS are required by the new norm to maintain a cooling-off period of 30 days between two periods of leverage or borrowing. Also, SEBI requires all CDS transactions by AIFs to be traded on some regulated platform in order to enhance transparency and accountability in the dealings.\n\nAnalysis and Observations\n\nThe permission to AIF to put their hands in the CDS market is an enabling gesture from SEBI to provide the wax of credit risk management to AIFs. By allowing AIFs that have already invested millions in debt securities, CDS offers them an important avenue of risk transference and management and also extends a shell of protection to them during unfavorable times of credit events. \n\nThis amendment marks a positive attitude from the SEBI to provide more feathers for growth to AIFs, unlike its earlier restrictive stance to any sort of guarantees from AIFs. With posing confidence in AIF to upkeep the nerve of economic stability, especially through the derivatives, SEBI has signaled in unequivocal terms that it is open to a more dynamic growth of the AIF sector.\n\nHowever, a close look at the amendment flags some key issues which are highlighted here:\n\nLow appetite for low-quality credit\n\nThe CDS may not be successful for high credit-quality corporate bonds like secured sovereign-backed, Triple AAA Bonds. It may hold good when it comes to the low-quality credit market. However, there is a very less appetite for low-quality credit in India including corporate bonds. This low-quality credit is usually offered as products from private unlisted funds, from whom the CDS sellers might be uninterested in buying owing to a lack of trust. This is one of the primary reasons why India’s corporate bond market has still not seen the sunshine of success. Therefore, this amendment is only a wax to the corporate bond industry but not the fuel for its progress.\n\nUnclear stance over CDS by Category I AIF\n\nWhile the amendment does allow Category I AIFs to buy CDS for hedging, it does not specify the after-modalities that need to be followed by the Category I AIFs. There has been no clarity provided with respect to the selling off of CDS by Category I AIF. They have been largely undermined in the amendment, though they have a crucial role to play in the AIF industry.\n\nNot a good experience from mutual funds industry\n\nThough the AIFs have been recently allowed to partake in CDS transactions, the same was allowed to the mutual funds industry around a decade ago. However, till now, the mutual funds industry has not even taken off when it comes to its dealings in CDS. Further, these amendments come at a time when SEBI itself is planning to revamp and mull afresh the present regulatory regime for CDS in the mutual funds industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe AIF industry is booming at an all-time high pace. With the latest amendment to the Regulations, AIFs have been allowed to participate in CDS transactions. This amendment is a welcoming step as it allows the AIFs to manage and transfer credit risk and take shell off from unfavorable credit events. However, the primary goal of the change, that is, to bring impetus to the corporate bond market of India, is not easy to be achieved. The corporate bond industry has hitherto been majorly lackadaisical owing to unlisted private functioning with less of sound trust in the market. \n\nHowever, there has been an initial positive sign from AIFs as regards the new regulatory amendment. Therefore, what needs to be seen is what AIFs have got to do with the Indian corporate bond market in the near future using the derivative boat of CDS at their disposal.\nCDSAIFMutual FundsSEBI\nCorporate Law\n387 views\n12 likes.

        "title": "Muddy Waters of Regulating Online Bond Platforms",
        "content": "Pritha Lahiri\nFeb 16\n6 min read\nMuddy Waters of Regulating Online Bond Platforms\n[Pritha is a student at Institute of Law, Nirma University.]\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in online bond platforms in India. These markets account for trillions of rupees and offer immense scope of improvement, specifically in the non-institutional space. Previously, these platforms were either unregulated or managed through their own set of different rules and regulations resulting in an un-uniform state of affairs and inadequate disclosures which prevented investors from investing in the bond market.  \n\nIn a rather progressive move, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recently amended the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities Regulations) 2021 (NCS Regulations) to insert a new Chapter VIA which specifically deals with online bond platforms (OBPs). \n\nThe framework provides partial relief to the investors by removing the prevailing ambiguity surrounding the online bond market and, at the same time, protecting the interests of such investors who regularly invest in the market. However, it does not go far enough to transform the existing structure of the bond market so as to synchronise with the increasing affinity of investors in the bond market. The framework comes as a welcome but a static acceleration in the right direction, with much wiggle room for further improvements. This article discusses the new amendment and its implications, and makes suggestions that could better deal with the existing issues in regulating online bond trading platforms. \n\nWhat is Online Bond Trading?\n\nSimply stated, bonds are investments that provide investors with high returns in exchange for lending money to borrowers, who are typically governments or businesses. OBPs provide investors, especially non-institutional investors, a way to access the bond market. Bonds can either be issued on the primary market, where fresh debt is issued, or they can be traded on the secondary market, where investors can buy debt that has already been issued through brokers or other intermediaries. A company promises investors through the issuance of a bond that it will pay interest at a specific rate for a predetermined duration of time. Bond trading offers stability by significantly reducing risk in portfolios, in contrast to volatile stock markets. \n\nSEBI in its NCS Regulations has defined an OBP as an “..electronic system that is not a recognised stock exchange or an electronic book provider and where listed or prospectively listed debt securities are provided. An individual owning or operating such a platform is referred to as the online bond platform provider.” \n\nThe New Regime\n\nRegistration as ‘stock brokers’\n\nIn accordance with the new amendment, SEBI has incorporated Regulation 51A to the NCS Regulations, which requires OBPs to register as 'stock brokers' with the SEBI. The SEBI has granted OBP a three-month deferral to implement the rules beginning on the day this regulation takes effect. \n\nIncorporation requirement\n\nThe circular released by SEBI states that such an entity shall be an incorporated Indian company and shall register as a stockbroker on the stock exchange's debt segment after which it shall only offer listed securities and securities that are being proposed to be listed.  \n\nPost-registration requirement\n\nAn entity would have to submit an application to the stock exchange as per Annex-A of the circular to perform the duties of an OBP after becoming registered as a stockbroker in the debt segment of a stock exchange. \n\nAdditional compliances\n\nThe entity will have to make sure that its application complies with all rules for roles and responsibilities, technology, operating and complete risk management framework, Know Your Client (KYC) for onboarding investors and sellers, the risk profile of investors, transparency, and disclosure along with the necessary due diligence. It would also have to abide by the registration requirements as updated from time to time by the SEBI.\n\nThe Unattended Issues in the New Framework\n\nIndian bond platform anticipates drawing in more investors as a result of the introduction of the new framework. Investors would benefit greatly from these simplified procedures since it eliminates confusion caused by the existence of numerous bond platforms, each with its own set of policies and grievance procedures. However, there are still some aspects of the framework which lie in the grey area: \n\nNo mention of advertising through social media and by celebrities\n\nAnnex-C of the framework, which prescribes the Advertisement Code for the OBPs, has possibly missed out on the increasing indulgence and dependency on social media in daily lives. According to a study, near about 80% of investors depend on social media for knowledge on investment in the course of their work. The new framework, however, does not contain any provision for social media advertising. Furthermore, it expressly prohibits celebrities from appearing in any advertisements involving the bond market. While the rationale behind such a move is unclear, enabling social media advertising might have made it easier for these OBPs to connect with their retail investors and attract investors to invest in such markets. \n\nOne possible alternative to such an embargo could have been taken from the example of the United States wherein initiatives have been launched to address investors' lack of knowledge by specifically emphasizing the possible interface of online and print media with the bond markets to improve their bond information. \n\nRestriction on unlisted debt platforms\n\nUnder the new framework, the platforms are not allowed to market unlisted bonds under the new rules. The newly added provision's clear language essentially forbids the sale of bonds that are not listed. However, contrarily, SEBI allows foreign portfolio investors to invest in unlisted debt platforms but excludes it from the ambit of the new amendment. Since debt trading platforms include both listed and unlisted debts, this deregulated unlisted debt market could make matters extra cumbersome. Although the move was made to protect investors from the risks associated with unlisted debts, prohibiting investment in unlisted bonds will have a counter-effective result on the investors leaving them with fewer investments.\n Instead of a blanket ban on the transaction of unlisted bonds, SEBI could have explored the possibility of introducing a separate guideline as has been implemented in Kuala Lampur where there is a separate framework in place for unlisted bonds wherein investors are protected from any risks arising out of any transaction involving unlisted bonds. Similarly, SEBI could have balanced the interests of both ends by introducing a different set of guidelines for the unlisted bond platforms wherein the risks of investing in an unlisted bond could have been highlighted along with sanctions and rules for investor protection and grievance redressal. Furthermore, a checklist for the investors could have been provided to ascertain their readiness to invest in the unlisted bond market requiring that an investor must fulfil a minimum of certain criteria to be eligible for such investment. This would allow investors to have greater access to the bond market. \n\nSetting a minimum transaction limit of INR 2,00,000 and the problem of liquidity\n\nDespite the bond market growing exponentially in the past few years, SEBI has set a minimum transaction size limit of INR 2,00,000 for investing through such OBPs, however, those investing in lesser value often face the risk of lesser liquidity due to low yield. \n\nWith the growing popularity of digital ledger technology (DLT) and crypto assets, integration of DLT and OBPs can revolutionize the existing system. DLTs function like a virtual ledger where transactions are recorded in a difficult-to-tamper-with record that is accessible to all parties, encrypted, and duplicated in their computer networks. \n\nSEBI could have ventured into the integration of DLTs which could have helped with the liquidity problem by tokenization of the bonds at source, against which the investors can transact in real-time without any intermediary intervention and using smart contracts (executed automatically on meeting certain pre-programmed steps) through which certain order and pricing data can be shared using bilateral smart protocols thereby increasing the pre-trade data available through which liquidity can be improved. DLT can thus remove the existing impediments in the Indian bond market thereby enabling smaller players to enter a productive investment with negligible fixed costs. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe new amendment has the potential to significantly improve India's standing in terms of online bond trading platform regulations. However, in order to make sure that these regulations are effective, SEBI must maintain a careful balance between safeguarding investors while at the same time fostering a conducive environment for the bond markets to thrive. By incorporating the changes as suggested above, SEBI can eliminate the existing inconsistencies under the new amendment which, although motivated by the right concerns, may end up being detrimental in the long run.\nSEBIOnline Bond Trading PlatformsNon-Convertible Securities\nCorporate Law\n191 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Consent Matters! Finding Consent in the Group of Companies Doctrine",
        "content": "Ryan Joseph, Aswath Srinivasan\nFeb 14\n6 min read\nConsent Matters! Finding Consent in the Group of Companies Doctrine\n[Ryan and Aswath are students at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Supreme Court of India (SCI) in Cox and Kings Limited v. SAP India Private Limited, referred the application of the group of companies doctrine to a larger bench. In this case, Justice Ramana, writing for the majority, questioned the validity of the doctrine on the ground that such a doctrine disregards parties’ consent. This article traces the origins of the group of companies doctrine and analyses its transplantation into India to find that the doctrine was always founded in consent. This article then analyses cases that adjudicated over the doctrine to find that due to a misunderstanding of the doctrine, Indian courts have applied it in a manner where party’s consent has been entirely disregarded, which has caused the doctrine to become synonymous with non-consensual ways of joinder such as “lifting the corporate veil”. This article then concludes that the error (of lack of consent) lies in the historic application of the doctrine and is not an error that is inherent in the doctrine. \n\nWhat is the Group of Companies Doctrine?\n\nWhen two parties enter a contract with an arbitration clause, then under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, a group company of either party, despite being a non-signatory to the contract, can be made a party to such arbitration proceedings arising out of that contract. In Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, the SCI read the “claiming through or under” in Section 8 of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 to allow for the joinder of group companies in arbitration. Prima facie, it appears that such a joinder is in contravention of the principle of party autonomy and does not sit well with the fact that arbitration is a consensual exercise. It appears all that is needed for such a joinder to be permissible is the fact that the party being joined is a part of the group of companies of one of the parties to the parent contract. This apparent lack of consent in allowing such joinders under the group of companies doctrine is the fundamental argument that Justice Ramana has made in his judgement. \n\nHe stated that the application of the impugned doctrine in the foregoing manner erases the legal distinction between a parent company and its subsidiary. While substantiating his claim, he delves into the analysis of recent judgements of the SCI. He critiques Chloro Controls v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc. on the ground that it applied the contract law principle “consent” to the group of companies doctrine, which has its evolution within the realm of arbitration and has never intermingled with contract law principles. By bifurcating the two, he is stating that it is futile to engage in consent analysis in extending arbitration proceedings to non-signatories through the group of companies doctrine because it has nothing to do with contractual principles and is purely an arbitration law phenomenon. It can be inferred from this that Justice Ramana finds the basis of consent only in contract law and not within the group of companies doctrine. However, the court in Chloro Controls undertook a consent analysis in the process of extending the arbitration clause to a non-signatory through the doctrine because consent has always been an inherent trait of the doctrine. The decoupling of the doctrine from consent is a result of myriad judgements that have only focused on the effect of the doctrine of joining non-signatories and ignored its purpose of finding parties who may have not signed the contract but consented to the terms and performed actions in pursuance of those terms.[1]\n\nConsent and Group of Companies Doctrine\n\nDecoupling arbitration from contract law is a sin in law, for the genesis of arbitration is in the consensus ad idem of the parties that is manifested vide an arbitration agreement. Without an agreement, you do not have arbitration. Party autonomy and consent are the grundnorms of arbitration. Therefore, the argument that “consent analysis” is shoehorned into arbitration does not hold water. The fact that consent was always a key element in the group of companies doctrine is evident from the jurisprudential evolution of the doctrine. The most important case to be considered in understanding the roots of the consent element in the group of companies doctrine is the ICC arbitration proceedings of Dow Chemical France v. ISOVER Saint Gobain that birthed this doctrine. The arbitral tribunal held that the fact that the non-signatory party, in this case, was involved in the negotiation stage of the agreement, was bestowed with the responsibility of performing the obligations incurred by the signatory group company and was also responsible for the termination of the agreement, signified the existence of consent of the contracting parties to bind the non-signatory group company to the agreement as well. This exercise was carried out in Dow Chemicals to allow the holding company of Dow Chemicals AG and another group subsidiary, to be parties to the arbitration as these entities had a huge role to play in bringing the contract into existence even though neither formally signed the agreement. Similarly, in other cases, this doctrine may also be used to ensure defendants are not allowed to absolve themselves of liability accruing from a contract by transferring the risk of performance of the contract to a group company that was not a signatory to the contract previously. \n\nIn essence, this exercise is a reaction to the complexities that have arisen in transnational disputes due to the ubiquitous use of subsidiaries post the advent of globalisation. In line with the global trends in arbitration, to accommodate for group company structures, the SCI in Cheran Properties v. Kasturi and Sons held that the group of companies doctrine facilitates the mutual intention of the signatories to the arbitration agreement to bind both signatories and non-signatories when such intention was apparent. To extend the arbitration agreement through this doctrine, the court would have to find an intention to bind a non-signatory who has “assumed the obligation to be bound by the actions of the signatory”. As a sequitur, in Reckitt Benckiser v. Reynders Label Printing, it was held that there must be evidence to show that the non-signatory group company was involved in the negotiations or closing of the parent agreement, and without such evidence, even if the non-signatory company and one of the signatory companies were part of a group of companies, the arbitration agreement cannot be extended to the non-signatory. \n\nThe foregoing ratios adumbrate that the group of companies doctrine is not a utilitarian exercise that is undertaken to allow the claimants to maximise damages by roping in group companies; rather, it is a legitimate exercise undertaken to identify all the parties that consented to arbitration despite not being signatories to the contract. It was this understanding that ensured that whenever courts do apply the doctrine, they only rope in parties that consented to the arbitration. However, this understanding was eventually muddled in a frenzy of case laws where the doctrine was used as a tool to maximise damages. In fact, J Ramanna in Cox and Kings even admitted that the group of companies doctrine “appears to have been based, more on economics and convenience rather than law.”\n\nWith the shift in the usage of the doctrine, courts started making entities parties to the arbitration on extremely flimsy grounds. For instance, in SEI Adhavan Power Private Limited and Others v. Jinneng Clean Energy Technology Limited, the court made non-signatory group companies a party to an arbitration proceeding regarding the breach of an undertaking, based solely on the fact that the non-signatories were part of the same group of companies as the signatory, as both shared common email addresses, had common centralised control, and that the transactions in question pertained to a common project. No consideration was given to whether the parties intended to bind non-signatory group companies to the arbitration clause. Similarly, in RV Solutions Private Limited v. Ajay Kumar Dixit and Others, the court extended the arbitration proceedings to non-signatories on grounds of common interests, parties, and subject matter. No consideration was given to any other doctrinal elements. In fact, in Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited v. Ratan India Power Limited, the court applied the group of companies doctrine by roping in the theories of piercing the corporate veil and alter ego, which are non-consensual modes of lifting up a corporate structure to find one controlling force and have nothing to do with the principle of the group of companies under arbitration.\n Conclusion\n\nIt is important to recognise that the group of companies doctrine is not problematic. It neither violates party autonomy, nor does it rest uneasily with the consent-based nature of arbitration. The problem lies with the decoupling of consent from the doctrine. While party’s consent is clearly present in the landmark cases that shaped the application of this doctrine, with time, the focus of the doctrine shifted from identifying parties who may not be signatories to the contract but consented to it, to applying the doctrine to any group company. The larger bench that adjudicates upon this doctrine must open its eyes to this departure from the foundational rationale of the doctrine. It must consider the utility accruing from the correct application of the doctrine and instead of focusing on the problems caused by its fallacious application and doing away with the entire doctrine itself. Rather, reaffirming the importance of engaging in consent analysis before applying the doctrine would go a long way in bolstering India’s growing arbitration framework.\n[1] Manasi Kumar, ‘The ‘Composite Transaction’ and Extension of Arbitration Agreements in India’ (2020) 37(3) Journal of International Arbitration 363.\nGroup of CompaniesCox and KingsArbitration\nDispute Resolution\n371 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Supertech Insolvency: A Tussle Between Rights of Home-Buyers and Maximizing Assets under CIRP",
        "content": "Aayush Panwar, Aditya Maheshwari\nFeb 8\n5 min read\nSupertech Insolvency: A Tussle Between Rights of Home-Buyers and Maximizing Assets under CIRP\n[Aayush and Aditya are students at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe recent decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the matter of Ram Kishor Arora v. Union Bank of India and Another, concerning the bankruptcy of Supertech Limited (Supertech) has once again erupted the issue of inclusion of reverse corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for the real-estate companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). As provided under IBC, the object of CIRP is to maximize the assets available; however, in real-estate cases, to protect the interest of home-buyers, only the particular project of a builder is subject to insolvency process by the adjudicating authority, and the rest is kept outside the scope of the CIRP, the same being regarded as reverse CIRP.\n\nRecently, Supertech was declared bankrupt by the National Company Law Tribunal on the application filed by the Union Bank of India for a default of INR 432 crores. However, NCLAT granted some relief to Supertech and favored project-wise insolvency, i.e., the committee of creditors would be constituted only for the disputed project, Ecovillage II, located at Greater Noida, and would be under the insolvency process, while the remaining projects would be constructed by the promoter as a going concern, in the supervision of interim resolution professional. \n\nThis article aims to elucidate the provisions pertaining to this concept under IBC and the repercussions of the application of this process in light of the judicial pronouncements and legislative intent behind Section 29A of IBC. \n\nReverse CIRP: A Peculiar Concept vis-à-vis IBC Regime\n\nIBC regime - a legislative intent contradictory to reverse CIRP\n\nThe concept of reverse CIRP does not find its place in the legislative text; on the contrary, in some places, it harms the spirit of IBC. The IBC clearly provides for the insolvency of the corporate debtor; there is no concept of project insolvency as such. Apart from that, Section 14 of IBC provides for the moratorium on activities of the corporate debtor, while reverse CIRP allows the continuation of other projects.\n\nWith the amendment to IBC in 2019, ‘home buyers’ are included in the category of financial creditors, and the amount raised from allottees under a real estate project is financial debt under Section 5(8)(f) of IBC. As such, the insolvency cases against the real estate developers have increased, although a limit of 10% or 100 members to file Section 7 applications against the builder prevents the opening of floodgates for such applications.\n\nIn the case of CIRP, as per IBC, when the moratorium period operates, the activities including construction by the builder are halted. This is disadvantageous for both the builders as well as home-buyers. The objective of home-buyers is to get their dream home, and their focus is not  on effectuating the bankruptcy of the builder. Therefore, the concept of reverse CIRP was evolved by NCLAT to save the business. \n\nJudicial pronouncement contradictory to legislative intent \n\nSince the inception of IBC, the intention of the tribunal has been to make rulings within the scheme of IBC. The scheme of IBC has rightly been summed up in the Swiss Ribbons v. Union of India, as an effort to maximize the value of the corporate debtor’s assets through restructuring while allowing it to operate successfully as a going concern. However, the Supreme Court in the Essar Steel v. Satish Kumar (Essar Steel) noted that IBC being an economic legislation, the denial of the right to experiment is fraught with serious consequences to the nation. \n\nThe NCLAT, relying on the observation made in the Essar Steel case, did an experiment in Flat Buyers Association v. Umang Realtech Private Limited to introduce the concept of reverse CIRP. This judgment has been considered contradictory to the legislative intent as through this, it is being suggested that the resolution plan reach finality without the approval of the third-party resolution plans, which is contradictory to Section 29A of IBC. While the judgment was a welcoming step for the prosperity of the real estate business and the rights of the allottees, it is contradictory to the scheme that was contentious.  \n\nSupertech Case – An Experiment that Needs to be Halted?\n Two years after the evolution of this concept, the legality and well as the practicality of this again came up in Supertech case. Taking a practical approach, this evolution is a better solution for the insolvency of real estate developers and builders. The regular CIRP would not work efficiently because allottees as financial creditors will not be able to appreciate the resolution plans put before them. In addition to this, there can be no possibility of hair cut in case of claims of allottees; hence regular CIRP may not work in such situation. If the builder goes into liquidation, the hope of getting possession of every project of the builder will go in vain. \n\nHowever, a disadvantageous situation may occur in case of project-wise insolvency. If the developer knows that insolvency proceedings will not have an impact on other projects, it may have a reckless approach towards a particular project and may try to siphon off funds towards the other projects from the distressed project. \n\nWhile focusing on the reasoning provided by the court in the Supertech case, stress has been put on the protection of the rights of the home-buyers. While the experiment by the court to ensure business efficacy is considered a good move by the industrialist, the same shall not go beyond the legislative intent of the makers of the IBC. In the year 2018, Section 29A was added in the IBC with the intention of strengthening corporate governance under the IBC by restricting the participation of the promoters in the corporate restructuring process, as the same would restrict the backdoor entry of promoters. However, the Supertech case allowed one of the promoters to act as a lender to assist the corporate debtor in completing the construction of flats outside the CIRP. Here, the court’s act of putting more prominence on business efficacy and the right of the home-buyers over legislative intent in the name of experiment could turn into a disastrous move. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe rationale behind the concept of reverse CIRP was that although the developer of various projects may be the same, the financial creditors and the operational creditors would be different. Since the other projects have no strings attached to the distressed project, there is no need for all the projects to be involved in CIRP to maximize assets. However, it is very much important to weigh both sides in a given case before arriving at a conclusion, and the same is with reverse CIRP. The rights and welfare of builders, as well as home-buyers, must be considered, and that too within the permissible limits of the legislative text. \n\nThe implausible reasoning of the court to allow the reverse CIRP in the real-estate cases is erroneous on the ground that in case the promoter failed to adhere to the guidelines provided under the reverser CIRP, the original process would be initiated, and the same would waste the time of the tribunal. Moreover, the power of the judiciary is to decide the case under the scheme of the legislation. This experiment should be given a second thought by the tribunals to bring the same in line with the scheme of the IBC.\nInsolvencyCIRPIBCSupertechNCLAT\nInsolvency Law\n710 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "Obligatory or Optional? Pre-Institution Mediation in Commercial Courts Act",
        "content": "Aadya Narain\nFeb 5\n5 min read\nObligatory or Optional? Pre-Institution Mediation in Commercial Courts Act\n[Aadya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe enactment of the Commercial Courts Act (Act) in 2015 was the culmination of a nearly decade-long process to increase the efficacy of commercial dispute resolution and ease of doing business in India. It was within this context of attempting to reduce the burden on courts and thereby ensuring speedier justice dispensation, that means of alternative dispute resolution were greatly emphasised within the legislation. Section 12A of the Act states:\n\n(1) A suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this Act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre- institution mediation” (emphasis supplied). \n\nThe source of contestation lies in the use of the word “shall”; is pre-institution mediation mandatory or simply strongly advised? \n\nPre-institution mediation requires the intervention of a neutral third party to resolve the dispute, before resorting to time–consuming, costly, and thus often inefficient litigation. The Singapore Convention on Mediation, adopted in 2018, was a global recognition of the necessity to promote all forms of alternative dispute resolution within established judicial structures in countries, rather than placing the entire burden, particularly of cases requiring consensus rather than a win/loss outcome. Ratifying this treaty, the Act, among a slew of other amendments, introduced Section 12A in 2018. Before this, Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1909 was amended in 1999 to encourage alternate dispute resolution “where it appears to the court that there exist elements of a settlement”, but not mandate it, as Section 12A is believed to. \n\nUnder Section 12A, unless there is any interim urgency, for example, patent infringement, wherein time is of the essence to prevent abrogation of justice, all commercial matters shall undergo the pre-institution of mediation and settlement process. The statutory requirement is three months, potentially extended by another two under mutual consent. If a settlement is reached within the stipulated period, it shall be binding under Section 30 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. If not, the matter will be presented before the commercial court. \n\nInterpretation and Evolution of Case Law \n\nSection 12A has been interpreted and applied by High Courts across the country. In Dredging and Desiltation Company v. Macintosh Burn (2019), the Calcutta High Court clarified that the objective of the 2015 Act is maximising efficiency and minimising the length of dispute resolution. Thus, it provides a sufficient period for fruitful mediation, and yet still lesser than the time required for a litigation to reach finality. This was in concurrence with Laxmi Polyfab v. Eden Realty, when the same bench held that the plaintiff’s right to approach a commercial court is not unconditional, but subject to the provisions of Section 12A, mandating an attempted mediation. The Allahabad High Court similarly affirmed the mandatory nature of the section in Awasthi Motors v. Managing Director M/s. Energy Electricals Vehicle and Another. \n\nThe Bombay High Court went a step further to clarify the nature of Section 12 and the necessary steps to ensure substantial compliance with the same. In 2021, in the case of Ganga Taro Vazirani v. Deepak Raheja, the plaintiff filed a suit in the commercial court, and some form of alternative dispute resolution was pursued only post this, despite no plea for urgent relief. A single judge held the provisions of Section 12A to be procedural, and thus this action was valid under the doctrine of substantial compliance. To this end, the learned judge held that although the provision mandates that parties attempt amicable settlement, it is not compulsory to do so before filing a suit in the commercial court, for the procedural mandate to be fulfilled. Later the same year, acting on an appeal filed by the defendant, a division bench of the same court overturned this verdict.  Therefore, in Deepak Raheja v. Ganga Taro Vazirani, the division bench held that this interpretation of Section 12A, as procedural and not mandatory, defeated its purpose, which was to unencumber courts. If the suits filed before the commercial court could not automatically be assumed as either seeking urgent relief, or seeking last resort having attempted a settlement, the administrative burden on courts to ascertain these criteria, and accordingly segregate cases would substantially increase. Further, it may lead to parallel adjudications on the same issue, or a later discovery of non-compliance would lead to significant resources used incorrectly by the court. \n\nUnder this understanding, the test of substantial compliance for this section would comprise three elements; (a) an attempt to mediate the dispute; (b) failure of that attempt; and (c) such failure compelling the plaintiff to approach the court. All three of these must occur prior to filing a suit before the commercial court, to fulfil the objective of 12A. The procedure clarified by this court resembles the internationally acknowledged “opt-out” model, wherein it is compulsory for parties to attend at least single mediation session before their case is heard before the court. Therefore, parties will soon have the opportunity to resort to traditional litigation, but are encouraged to explore alternate dispute resolution. This measure is particularly crucial in India, where mistrust of out of court settlements have led to an overburdening of courts, with cases often unsuited to an adversarial adjudication. \n\nThe Madras High Court seems to be the only court to have a bench that diverges from the fundamental understanding of Section 12A as making pre-institutional mediation compulsory. In Shahi Exports Private Limited v. Goldstar Line Limited and Others, it observed that the right to access justice, which is a constitutional right, cannot be denied, deprived, or contingent on not resorting to alternative means of dispute resolution. It further stated the court is not a substitute for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms – rather, the opposite is true. Therefore, it held that Section 12A cannot and must not be read as mandatory or close the doors of the courts to litigants. \n\nThe Way Forward \n\nDue to the differences in the interpretation of various appellate courts in India, the question of whether pre-institutional mediation is compulsory or not under Section 12A, remains to be settled by the apex court, as and when it arises. However, resolving commercial disputes in India takes nearly four years (1420 days) (as of 2015), delayed by the high pendency of cases, complex litigation procedures, and a host of similar reasons. If the Indian justice dispensation system is to remain up to the challenge of tackling rapidly proliferating, complex commercial disputes promptly, it must continue to take steps in the direction of alternate dispute resolution as a viable and widely recognised option. Ranging from Eurasian countries such as Italy, Turkey, and Azerbaijan, which have settled on the “opt-out model” to East Asian countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong, which have created arbitration and mediation ecosystems settling and decide multi-billion, international disputes, the experience of alternate dispute resolution globally has been positive and encouraging. \n\nAlthough India requires sophisticated infrastructure to administer the influx of cases that a compulsory mediation requirement would bring, this would develop swiftly and naturally when there is a considerable lacuna of qualified professionals in a prestigious field. The benefits would be manifold. This alternative infrastructure would provide massive amounts of employment, increase the efficiency and speed of dispute resolution, reduce the burden on courts, save parties the future costs of litigation and potential losses, and increase the ease of doing business in India, the purpose for which the Act was created. Therefore, rather than debate the nature of Section 12A, the consensus and emphasis of courts in India must be on creating systems that make the mandatory fulfilment of this section worthwhile for all parties. \nCommercial CourtsSection 12APre-InstitutionMediation\nDispute Resolution\n651 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "The Convolutions of the New ODI Framework: A Companies Act Perspective",
        "content": "Kunwar Arpit Singh\nFeb 3\n6 min read\nThe Convolutions of the New ODI Framework: A Companies Act Perspective\n[Kunwar is a student at School of Law, Christ University.]\n\nThe new ‘overseas investment’ framework (New Framework) comprises the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Rules 2022 (OI Rules), the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Regulations 2022 (OI Regulations) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Directions 2022 (OI Directions). Introduction of the New Framework is crucial for promoting offshore investments by resident Indians. It is not surprising that the stakeholders and industry participants have received it positively. The New Framework replaces the following legislations: the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of any Foreign Security) Regulations 2004; the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property Outside India) Regulations 2015, and the Master Direction – Direct Investment by Residents in Joint Venture/Wholly Owned Subsidiary Abroad.\n\nThe author has particularly analysed the restrictions on the number of layers of subsidiaries provided in the OI Rules and attempted to resolve the confusion surrounding the relevant provisions of the New Framework. To determine the scope and potential impact of the new overseas investment laws, a comparative analysis with the Companies Act 2013 (Companies Act) and its rules regarding key definitions of \"subsidiary\" and \"control\" has also been undertaken.\n\nRound Tripping and Calculating the Number of Layers of Subsidiaries\n\nRound tripping in the present context can be explained as a practice of an Indian company investing in a foreign subsidiary company and that subsidiary company ultimately investing back in India. It can also be seen as a method of foreign direct investment (FDI). Previously, the round tripping of investments was strictly prohibited by a blanket ban imposed by RBI via the erstwhile clarification issued under the FAQs on Overseas Direct Investment (updated as of 19 September 2019) (ODI). This blanket ban was imposed by FAQ 64 of the RBI’s FAQs on ODI by restricting the foreign entity from setting up Indian subsidiaries or investing in a ‘joint venture’ that already had direct or indirect investments in India. \n\nThe new framework under Rule 19(3) of the OI Rules expressly allows the Indian entity to invest in a foreign entity with up to two layers of subsidiaries. Nevertheless, this instantly raises doubt as to whether this rule applies in the context of the Indian entity or its foreign subsidiary. In the event the rule in question applies to the Indian entity, only one step down subsidiary (SDS) can be held by such Indian entity in addition to its foreign subsidiary. If the rule applies to the foreign subsidiary, the foreign subsidiary can further hold two more SDS (i.e., three layers subsidiaries in total for the Indian entity). We can have a definite answer by referring to different provisions of the New Framework.\n\nClause 20(2) of OI Directions provides that the foreign entity which invests back in India cannot invest directly or indirectly in more than two layers of the SDS as per Rule 19(3) of the OI Rules. Furthermore, the note to Clause 20 states that a subsidiary is an entity over which the foreign entity has control. This provision also expressly enables the practice of round tripping investments as it mentions the process of round tripping, unlike Rule 19(3) of the OI Rules, which only provides for restricting the number of subsidiaries to two. More importantly, it becomes clear that the foreign entity should be considered the base for assessing the SDS. In addition, the definition of a subsidiary under Rule 2(1)(y) of the OI Rules defines a subsidiary with reference to the foreign entity.  \n\nAnother authoritative confirmation in favour of foreign entities is provided by the instructions for Form FC under the Master Direction – Reporting under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999, which states that the level of SDS shall be calculated by treating the foreign entity as the parent. Hence, the above-stated provisions frame a more precise picture of a more liberalised interpretation of Rule 19(3) for computing the number of layers of subsidiaries. It can also be seen as a way of promoting round tripping investments in India by the RBI after years of dissent. If the Indian entity were used as the base level for computing the following two levels of subsidiaries, it would have severely restricted the scope of round tripping investments in India. Having the foreign entity as a base for calculating the layers of the subsidiary provides more flexibility for the investor to round trip investments back in India. \n\nComparative Analysis with Company Law and Rules\n\nThe provision to Rule 19(3) refers and adheres to Companies (Restriction on Number of Layers) Rules 2017 (Layer Restriction Rules) to restrict the subsidiary rules from applying to banking companies, NBFCs, insurance companies and government companies. However, the Rule 2(1) of the Layer Restriction Rules conflicts with Rule 19(3) of OI Rules as it provides an exemption to foreign subsidiaries even if the number of layers exceeds two. The fact that OI Rules refers to the Layer Restriction Rules means that OI Rules should not be entirely interpreted by isolating Companies Act and its  rules. As it stands, the contradiction between the two above stated provisions needs to be clarified.\n\nAnother dichotomy of provisions is seen in the definition of 'subsidiary' and 'control'. OI Rules have defined 'subsidiary' as an entity over which the foreign subsidiary has control. The term 'control' is again defined as having 10% of voting rights in the entity and the right to elect a majority of the directors. This is a diversion from the definition of 'control' under Section 2(27) of the Companies Act and Regulation 2(1)(e) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover Code) Regulations 2011 (SAST Regulations) which do not include the 10% threshold in their definition of 'control'.  \n Section 2(87) of the Companies Act requires a holding company to have more than 50% of the voting power in the subsidiary company. Instead, the 10% voting rights requirement of OI Rules in a subsidiary company seems to be much closer to the concept of 'significant beneficial owner' (SBO) provided under Section 90 of the Companies Act and the Companies (Significant Beneficial Owner) Rules 2018 (SBO Rules). An SBO under Rule 2(1)(h) of the SBO Rules will hold 10% of the voting rights or shares in the entity either directly or indirectly, similar to the qualifications of a subsidiary under the OI Rules. The identification and compliance of the SBO under Section 90 of the Companies Act and the SBO Rules have been laid down with detailed provisions and strict penalties in case of non-compliance. It does imply that a subsidiary under the OI Rules should not be viewed in any less seriousness than that provided under the Companies Act. In affirmation of this, placing the bar at 10% instead of over 50% for qualification as a subsidiary under the OI Rules helps to cast the net wider to cover more and more foreign entities, and these covered entities will then have to face the restrictions on the number of layers of subsidiaries. All in all, a principal Indian entity with a significant financial commitment to another foreign entity but not over 50% will be unable to evade the liabilities of restrictions on layers of subsidiaries due to a wider cast net.\n\nConclusion \n\nThe New Framework is yet another step forward in the government's quest to enhance the ease of doing business in the country. The OI Rules strikes the right balance between the flexibility and rigidity of investing overseas and other incidental matters. It is interesting to note that as recently as in 2021, the Draft Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments - Overseas Investment) Rules 2021 provided for not allowing any investments by the Indian entity in the foreign entities if it was ascertained that the investments are being round tripped for tax evasion. These provisions did not make it to the enacted new framework. Hence, the New Framework provides sufficient flexibility to allow the practice of round tripping in the first place and determine the SDS of the foreign entity as the first layer of the subsidiary.\n\nHowever, at the same time, it is rigid enough to divert from existing definitions of 'subsidiary' and 'control' to cover any loopholes regarding round tripping. The regulators' foresightedness to define ‘subsidiaries’ by a mere 10% financial commitment will ensure that round tripping cannot be used to commit any illegal financial investment. If the same qualifications for defining subsidiaries were used as that of the Companies Act, the Indian entities would have invested a significant amount in other foreign entities to round trip those investments back to India but would have ensured that the investment margin remained below the threshold of 50%. \nODISubsidiaryControlForeign ExchangeCompanies ActSEBI\nCorporate Law\n590 views\n2 likes.

        "content": "Sibasish Panda\nJan 31\n4 min read\nRegulation of Cross-Border Flow of Data under India's Proposed Data Protection Law\n[Sibasish is a student at National Law University, Odisha.]\n\nIf data is the new oil of the world economy, trade is the vehicle it needs to provide impetus to. National restrictions that impede companies from sharing data across borders affect their ability to operate in the overseas market. In view of supporting cross-border trade, several countries  are now seeking to balance the policies regarding cross border flow of personal data along with their erstwhile beliefs in data localization. In doing so they need to assuage the security and privacy risks that come with it. Digital trade clauses in foreign trade agreements (FTAs) are increasingly being considered as a tool to reduce friction caused by domestic regulations of cross-border data flows. Thus, a comprehensive data protection law will have rippling effects on the country's domestic as well as international trade. Through this blog, the author analyses the provisions regarding the cross-border transfer of data in the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022 (Draft Bill) released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.\n\nData Localization under the Draft Bill\n\nLocalization of personal data or personally identifiable information has been deemed necessary as its movement can raise concerns around privacy. It can also meet different regulatory objectives, help develop domestic capacity in digital intensive sectors and relate to national security, some of it is sensitive. The Draft Bill has relaxed provisions regarding data localization and moved away from hard data localization, as was seen under the now repealed Personal Data Protection Bill of 2019 (Repealed Bill). The Draft Bill seeks to promote cross-border transfer of data by a data fiduciary, in accordance with the prescribed conditions, to such countries or territories outside India as the Central Government may notify upon due assessment. \n\nThe data localization provisions in the Repealed Bill had also invited significant inputs from foreign technology companies and the US and the European governments, aside from the Indian start-ups. Some policies such as the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policies of 2012 advocate the physical storage of data within the borders of India. Though such hard policies may not be appreciated now considering the rising significance of data flow vis-à-vis trade, the Draft Bill’s failure to address data localization must be balanced with the need for increased cross-border trade and data security. \n\nCross-Border Flow of Data vis-à-vis Trade\n\nIn this evolving world of the internet and the AI, cross-border flow of data and trade agreements go hand in hand. Data itself being an asset enables the coordination of various international policies through global value chains, and global markets and promotes the trade of goods and services at a low cost. There has been no multilateral consensus on the same but several discussions are paving the way for the bigger picture. This effect of data flow on trade, however, raises various security and privacy concerns among nations. These concerns have, as a result, led several countries to enforce combative measures. \n\nIndia, in February 2022, signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with the United Arab Emirates for the regulations concerning data protection to be in line with international standards. India has also negotiated FTAs with SAARC, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, which deal with data protection. While the FTAs with Japan and Singapore have clauses specifying the ‘non-restriction on free flow and transfer of personal data’, the FTAs with South Korea and SAARC discuss privacy and protection of personal data as a general exception to the rules on provision of services. There have been talks about India and the European Union also entering into a broad-based trade and investment agreement since 2007. Considering the context of trade, India must continue to frame comprehensive policies regarding cross-border flow of data that can contribute to trade and boost the economy.\n\nJPC Report and the Draft Bill \n\nThe Draft Bill, in compliance with one of the suggestions of the Joint Parliamentary Committee report on the Repealed Bill (JPC Report), provides that personal data can be processed without the permission of the Central Government, outside the territory of India according to any contract entered into with any person outside the territory of India, enforcing any legal right, claim, judicial or quasi-judicial function, provided they are not against public order among other things such as the interests of sovereignty, integrity, security of the state, etc. \n\nThe Way Forward\n\nWith India engaging in FTAs, the government not only needs to have a liberal view regarding data localization as has been welcomed in the Draft Bill but also should regulate cross-border flow of data with adequate safeguards.\n\nExperts have lauded the conciseness and simplicity of the Draft Bill. Though the Draft Bill has shown a drift from the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), some of the provisions that it can inculcate is that of the binding corporate rules under Article 47 of the GDPR, which enable all future intra-group transfers with territories, once approval from the relevant authority is obtained. There can also be in place standard contractual clauses that provide sufficient safeguards for the transfers. The JPC Report had also recommended approval of each contract for data transfer to be done on a model basis by the authority.\n\nAt an international level, developing consensus-based regulations muddled with stringent adequacy policies is rather intrinsic to cross border flow of data. The role of the government when it comes to cross-border data flow involves prioritizing the digitalization of trade, along with the protection of privacy of the citizens. India has a say in bilateral arrangements wherein the most optimum and efficient route can be chosen without compromising the sectoral regulations or industrialization goals. The Draft Bill forges a path through which India can derive benefits from trade agreements by retaining its aspirations of data industrialization and obtain benefits from cross-border flow of data as well.\nData ProtectionPersonal DataCross-BorderJPC Report\nCommercial Law\n•\nLaw and Policy\n123 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Evaluating the Turquand Rule and its Exceptions in Common Law",
        "content": "Isha Khurana\nJan 28\n6 min read\nEvaluating the Turquand Rule and its Exceptions in Common Law\n[Isha is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Turquand rule, or alternatively, the doctrine of indoor management, offers protection to third parties while dealing with companies by allowing them to assume due compliance with the company’s internal regulations.[1] A company, therefore, cannot claim that the acts carried out by its officers were unauthorized and avoid liability. One could say that this doctrine gives people outside of a company unchecked and arbitrary powers. However, through case laws and jurisprudence, courts across different nations have developed certain exceptions for the exercise of this doctrine. These exceptions must be looked at as limitations to the arbitrary use of the doctrine that facilitate its optimum usage. For proving the same, this article highlights how the use of such exceptions serves the purpose of law and justice by preventing third parties from misusing the doctrine to support their wrongful gains or negligent acts. This article accordingly looks at the doctrine’s existence in various jurisdictions, analyses the development of its exceptions, while highlighting its continuing relevance in present-day company matters. \n Analyzing the Presence of Exceptions in Foreign Jurisdictions \n\nOriginating from English law, the doctrine has established itself in other common law jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia, and Australia. Raja Bahadur v. The Tricumdas Mills Company Limited, was one of the first cases in India to discuss this doctrine, followed by Lakshmi Ratan Cotton Mills v. JK Jute Mills Company. Here, the doctrine was applied positively to look after the third party interests. The courts stated that third parties who are dealing with companies cannot reasonably be expected to check the legality, propriety, and regularity of the acts of directors or their internal mechanisms.\n\nThis reasoning has found itself in Australian jurisprudence as established in Dey v. Pullinger Engg Co.[2] that the wheels of business would not run smoothly if the onus was consistently placed on outsiders to look into a company’s internal mechanisms and ensure that everything is functioning as planned. Stating the obvious, if the company itself is making representations that a person is authorised to carry out regular acts, and an outsider has fulfilled his duties of looking into the documents available to him, the liability should fall on the company as the outsider has made rightful presumptions of regularity. \n\nNevertheless, the doctrine’s applicability also depends on rightful conduct by outsiders. Malaysian courts have stated that the law imposes a minimum duty upon outsiders to perform necessary checks and due enquiry as may be required. Following this reasoning, courts have devised exceptions such as the due enquiry exception, forgery, and knowledge or suspicion of irregularity. Even a cursory reading of the exceptions would indicate that if any of the said situations were to exist, it would be arbitrary to impose liability on a company. I would say that the exceptions to the doctrine, by putting both parties on an equal footing and balancing their rights and responsibilities, ironically make the doctrine applicable. \n\nTaking the case of Devi Mal v. Standard Bank of India,[3] the third party here certainly knew that the director was disqualified from performing his regular duties. In these scenarios, it would be unfair to allow such an outsider, who was ignorant in his conduct and possessed knowledge of irregularities, to take advantage of the rule. Additionally, allowing parties to seek protection under irregularities that they were unaware about, due to their own fault, was also held to be against the spirit of the doctrine. For instance, if it is reflected in the company’s documents such as memorandum and articles of association that certain power has not been conferred upon a party, and they fail to make note of such matter, the irregularities arising out of such failure, are due to their own fault and cannot form a ground of defence. This understanding, coupled with that of the doctrine of constructive notice, provides a well-rounded image of the expectations and duties of a third party. At this juncture, it must be mentioned that the doctrine of constructive notice poses itself as a counter doctrine that places the onus on the third party to investigate the public documents of the company and take note of any irregularities they notice to ensure obedience and conformity with the internal regulations.  \n\nIt must also be noted that these exceptions to the doctrine’s applicability are not limited to India. Jurisprudence on this matter in foreign jurisdictions has also aided developments. Hence, studying these exceptions provides a more holistic picture. \n\nScope for Improvement in Indian Jurisprudence \n\nIn English law, forgery forms another exception, as noted in Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated,[4] where a secretary’s unauthorised act and a forged signature could not bind a company to any contract. This was rightly held since allowing an unauthorised person to enter into contracts on behalf of a company and upholding it would expose the company to wrongful liability and false claims. Indian law through Official Liquidator v. Commissioner of Police, upheld the same, since the forged signature of directors was not seen as binding on a company. \n\nEnglish law, in my opinion, has gone a step further and attempted to investigate whether insiders to a company, such as directors, can claim protection under this doctrine. In Morris v. Kanssen, the House of Lords held that since the plaintiff had assumed the duties of a director at the time of the transaction in question and had a duty to ensure consistency with internal requirements, he could not seek protection under this rule. Here, it is put forth that one of the major reasons for allowing outsiders to claim this rule was that if they do not have access to what is happening “behind the doors” of a corporation, they cannot be reasonably expected to know the same. It is thus argued that since directors are themselves a part of the internal workings of a company and have access to the internal regulations, it would only be their negligence and ignorance that would result in an absence of required knowledge, thereby rightly excluding them from this rule’s protection.\n\nIndian law can thus draw inspiration from cases such as Morris v. Kanssen that depict grey areas and perhaps study the role of members within the company itself that might not be privy to certain transactions, leading to further developments in the operation of this doctrine. The exceptions, thus, work to ensure that there is no misuse of this doctrine and are rightfully present to strike a balance between protection of a third party’s interest and proper, non-arbitrary enforcement of contracts against a company.\n\nArguing for a Concretised Presence of the Doctrine in Company Law \n\nThe exceptions observably seek to strike a balance between protection of an outsider’s interest and behaving fairly towards a company and especially its shareholders, who might be unaware of such misconduct. Further, as much as an outsider can use the doctrine as a shield to protect themselves, the company can also rightly use it as a sword. The exceptions show that the doctrine functions as a boomerang, and if an outsider does not act as he is expected to, the company pleads ultra vires or enforces constructive notice against him. One can thus argue that the presence of such exceptions enforces an authentic use of this doctrine and forms an important principle of company law. \n\nCompany law across nations is moving towards offering protection and aid to parties who may need it. Within Indian company law itself, minority shareholders are protected by the affirmative rights granted to them in the articles of association of a company by way of entrenchment clauses given in Section 5 of the Companies Act 2013. Through this, the decisions and opinions of minority shareholders are also required to be considered during resolutions, and such shareholders are well within their powers to oppose resolutions as well. A company also aims to protect itself from attempts at takeovers through practices such as liquidation protection rule which prevents withdrawal of shares by individual holders. So, when a company is protected from any takeovers or destruction through such mechanisms, why should this spirit of protection not extend to outsiders as well? \n\nClearly, the doctrine’s purpose and practical applicability, with its exceptions, only supports the contention that this rule must continue to exist in company matters and hence protect third parties from injustice.\n[1] Royal British Bank v. Turquand [(1856) 6 E&B 327]; Paul L. Davies and Sarah Worthington, Gower’s Principles of Modern Company Law (10th edition, Sweet and Maxwell, 2016). \n[2] Dey v. Pullinger Engg Co.

        "title": "Powers of ED Under Prevention of Money Laundering Law and the Tussle with IBC",
        "content": "Manik\nJan 23\n4 min read\nPowers of ED Under Prevention of Money Laundering Law and the Tussle with IBC\n[Manik is a student at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nThe basis for the formation of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) was to primarily enforce and ensure implementation of the two crucial laws, which are the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA) and the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA).\n\nThe PMLA empowers the ED to attach the property and Section 5(1) thereof lays down the power to temporarily attach the property with the adjudicating authority confirming the attachment under Section 8(3) of the statute which then leads to the government finally confiscating it under Section 9. The attachment of the property can be established by showing the existence of the proceeds of the crime.\n\nAlso, the second proviso of Section 5(1) of the PMLA provides for the attachment of the property on the ground that if the attachment is not done under the statute, this would affect the proceedings under the statute. \n\nED’S POWERS UNDER PMLA UPHELD \n\nThis second proviso to Section 5 of the PMLA was challenged in the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. UOI, where it was argued that this provision was broader than the scope of the main provision, and given that it allows for the attachment of the independent property even before the commission of the offence at the mere satisfaction of the officers, it has no fetters. But the court held that the section provides for a balancing arrangement with procedural safeguards in place for protecting the interest of the person concerned while also ensuring that the attached property remains available to be dealt with under the statute for the proceeds of the crime.\n\nIBC AND PMLA DEADLOCK  \n\n The issue in this scenario is that while the PMLA provides for the confiscation and the attachment of the property under Section 5, Section 32A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) provides immunity to the corporate debtor for the offence which is committed before the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) once it starts. So the issue is whether ED can exercise its powers to attach assets once CIRP has started. \n\nBoth the provisions - Section 238 of the IBC and Section 71 of the PMLA - came with the non-obstante clause, and thus both have an overriding effect which leads to a constant conflict between them. \n\nThe recent amendment to the PMLA by the Finance Act 2019 also failed to deal with this issue and did not provide any clarity in this regard.\n\nANALYSIS OF THE TUSSLE  \n\nThis complex tussle was taken up in the case of Nitin Jain Liquidator PSL Limited v. Enforcement Directorate, based on Section 32A of the IBC.  The issue taken up, in this case, was whether the powers of the ED under Section 5 of PMLA to attach assets of a corporate debtor can be exercised once Section 32A of the IBC has become applicable. The Delhi High Court, resolving this complexity, held that as soon as the liquidation process has been approved by the authority and the property is covered under the resolution plan, a statutory bar comes into play and then the ED’s power to attach assets under Section 5 of the PMLA would cease to exist when the liquidation process order is given under the IBC.\n\nNotwithstanding what has been stated above, it was clarified by the court that the property of a person who has been involved in money laundering can still be attached under PMLA and thus the statutory bar cannot be extended to them. Also, it has to be made sure that Section 32A does not act as an escape route for people engaging in money laundering activities and therefore the court, by adopting a balanced approach in this case, deterred individuals from engaging in such unlawful activities. \n\nAt one point, the case tried to present a solution to the possible conflict between the two laws. However, at the same time, the court left many things unanswered. Ambiguity remains as to whether the ED can attach the assets once the liquidation process is over. Further, clarity is needed as to whether the ED can attach the assets during this period when the liquidator has to give reports under Regulations 34 and 13 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations 2016, which will provide the manner of the sale of assets of the corporate debtor and lay out a proposed plan for the process of liquidation to get the approval of the NCLT. Since Section 32A can trigger only after the CIRP process has started, there is no clarity concerning this period. In another case concerning this issue (Directorate of Enforcement v. Manoj Kumar Aggarwal), the court failed to tackle this ambiguity but at the same time ensured that the corporate debtor’s properties are available for achieving the objectives under the IBC. It gave primacy to the IBC but also clarified that this should not be taken as an escape route because there are instances where the corporate debtor colludes with the creditors and get in the process of CIRP to escape from the actions of the ED. The final word from the Supreme Court of India is needed to resolve this conundrum and strike the right balance.\n\nAnother deadlock was expressed recently by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Committee of Creditors v. Directorate of Enforcement, wherein the court asked the government to resolve the ambiguity between the statutes, especially in the case where the property is purchased by the tainted money and the ED has attached it under Section 5 for sale at a lawfully conducted auction.\nThe court’s decision to give primacy to the IBC over the PMLA is essentially in line with the Insolvency Law Committee Report (2020) which stated that due to the threat of the liability falling upon acquirers, there may be a lower chance of the business being successfully acquired. Further, the court in the case of Ghanshayam Mishra and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited relied on the clean slate principle which extinguishes all past liabilities of the corporate debtor.\n\nCONCLUSION \n The power of the PMLA to attach assets under Section 5 is affected as and when Section 32A of the IBC comes up and the CIRP process begins. Thus, as a rule of interpretation, the courts should apply harmonious construction between these conflicting laws and should ensure that the objectives and purposes of both statutes are met. At the same time, the government should take steps to deal with ambiguities and clear the position concerning them. \nPMLAIBCMoney LaunderingInsolvencyCIRP\nInsolvency Law\n726 views\n13 likes.

        "title": "Navigating the New (Proposed) Disclosure Regime",
        "content": "Ajitesh Arya\nJan 22\n4 min read\nNavigating the New (Proposed) Disclosure Regime\n[Ajitesh is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nOn 12 November 2022, SEBI released a consultation paper suggesting certain overhauls in the disclosure regime enshrined under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation 2015 (LODR Regulations). \n\nEarlier, the companies proposing to be listed on the recognized stock exchanges had to enter into a listing agreement with the stock exchanges, and these agreements would contain obligations of  companies prior to and post the listing and the disclosures required to be made with the stock exchanges. These agreements, although enforceable in the court, lacked regulatory backing. The timely disclosure of any material changes in the conditions of the company is an important step in the direction of investor protection. Therefore, in 2015, SEBI decided to convert the listing agreement into LODR Regulations. \n\nThe LODR Regulations have been amended from time to time and SEBI has recently proposed some major changes in the regulations. This article will attempt to briefly explore the major changes and the implications of these proposals. \n\nThe Rationale for the Consultation Paper \n\nSEBI observed that there have been recent complaints regarding inaccurate and inadequate disclosures. It was also observed that despite the timelines mentioned across the LODR Regulations, there have often been complaints regarding delayed disclosures. \n\nWhile Part A of Schedule III of the LODR Regulations lists the events that are deemed to be material and require disclosure, Part B of the same schedule requires disclosure of the events on reaching the materiality threshold, determined on the basis of the materiality policy (that the companies are required to formulate in accordance with Regulation 30(4) of LODR Regulations). The absence of the clearly laid out standards for determination of the materiality threshold would reasonably lead the companies to pay lip service to the regulations without fulfilling the ultimate objective thereof. \n\nSEBI has, therefore, decided to come up with certain changes to deal with the issues of delayed and inadequate disclosures. While SEBI had the right objectives in mind, it might have gone a step too far in its endeavor, as has been explored in the article.\n\nMateriality Threshold \n\nPresently, as mentioned above, companies need to formulate a materiality policy for the determination of material events. The KMPs are entrusted with the task of determining the material events based on the policy. Often, the policies only replicate the language of Part B (for instance, refer to the materiality policy of ICICI) thereby giving wide and unfettered discretion to KMPs in naming any event being material or not. This discretion could lead to many events that might be material and price sensitive going undisclosed. \n\nSEBI has attempted to guide this discretion by stipulating that any event stipulated in Part B will be deemed to be material if the impact of the same in terms of values exceeds the lower of either 2% of turnover, or 2% of net worth, or 5% of the 3-year average of absolute value of profit/loss after tax. \n\nWhile one may argue that this proposal is contrary to the notion of Part B Schedule III and completely takes away the discretion ensured by the materiality policy, the author believes that the same was in fact a necessary step towards the investors' protection. An argument can be made towards raising the materiality threshold. Sometimes, the profit, the turnover, or the net worth of the company is subjected to fluctuation in the ordinary course of business and may not be material. Accordingly, it may be considered to raise the materiality threshold to 5% or 10% of the turnover/net worth.\n\nVerification of Market Rumors\n\nSEBI noted that with the rise of online media, there is a prevalence of news about companies, and if the news is fake, it could create a false market sentiment. Therefore, it is proposed that the top 250 companies based on market capitalization would now have to respond to the market rumor that might have a material impact on the listed company. \n\nIt is noted that Regulation 30(11) already provides that the companies can respond to the market rumors at its discretion and further, the stock exchange may also request the listed companies to clarify or respond to the market rumors. The additional requirement as proposed arguably seems extensive and would add to the compliance costs of companies. As SEBI rightly pointed out, with the rise of online media, it has become harder to keep track of rumors; as such, the top 250 companies are more likely to make a media presence every now and then, and therefore, to keep up with all media rumors and reporting, such companies would incur heavy costs and would have to deploy considerable resources. \n\nExtensive Disclosure\n\nWhile the saying “the light of day (and perhaps the warmth of the sun) can be the effective regulators” holds true, it is also true that excessive sunlight is dangerous. This is to say that while timely disclosure is an important step towards investor protection, excessive disclosure is counterproductive. Every event does not need to be disclosed. The investors especially retail investors have the bandwidth to process the limited amount of information. This is one of the reasons that CRA ratings are useful in making investment decisions. The new regime proposed by SEBI may lead to information overload. As discussed previously, the qualitative threshold of 2% may be extremely low, which might result in excessive disclosures. \n\nSimilarly, SEBI also proposes to mandate the companies to disclose to the stock exchange any communication made by the officials of the company. It is interesting to note that this requirement is not qualified by the materiality threshold, and therefore, any communication would have to be reported. The officials of the companies, in course of their media presence, often make fleeting statements regarding the companies; the same may be immaterial and, if disclosed, would only lead to information overload. Therefore, SEBI should clarify the proposed amendment to limit the disclosure of the official communications made by officials by a materiality threshold. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe recent consultation paper, if and when adopted, would be a marked step in the disclosure regime in India. The changes suggested would add to the deemed disclosure in Part A, Schedule III and restrict the discretion of the companies in determining the materiality threshold. SEBI has also attempted to fine-tune the timelines for making the disclosure. The paper has discussed how SEBI, although motivated by the right concerns, has again overstepped or overcompensated.\nLODRSEBIDisclosure Requirements\nCorporate Law\n192 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "The Fate of Pre-Pack in India",
        "content": "Deepali Bhandari\nJan 16\n4 min read\nThe Fate of Pre-Pack in India\n[Deepali is a student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.]\n\nWhile dealing with the financial distress during the pandemic, a Sub-Committee of Insolvency Law Committee was formed to envisage a pre-pack framework suitable for India, especially for micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and offer them temporary mitigation. In order to implement the simplest variant of the structure, MSMEs were selected as eligible sector for pre-packaged insolvency resolution process (PPIRP). While the committee studied the framework across jurisdictions, it could not formulate a framework tailored to the needs of MSMEs in India. The same is evidenced by the meagre number of two MSMEs admitted for PPIRP since its introduction in April 2021. \n\nThrough this article, the author analyses the possible reasons for the low rate of initiation under the framework. \n\nInherent Conflict\n\nPre-pack was introduced at the time of the pandemic to ensure that MSMEs, considered the backbone of the Indian economy, do not get pushed into insolvency. The structure was considered to be different from regular CIRP as PPIRP is based on debtor-in-possession model where the Board of Directors does not get dissolved, and there is no transfer of management to the Resolution Professional. While deliberating on the underlying features of the process, the Sub-Committee identified that the basic structure of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code) must be retained. It went on to identify three features as the basic structure of the Code: first, creditor in control; second, moratorium during the resolution process; and third, binding nature of an approved resolution plan. The basic structure provides that creditor must be in control which is contradictory to the distinguishing feature of PPIRP i.e., debtor-in-possession. Hence, there is an apparent conflict between the basic structure of the Code and the foundational principles of the pre-pack insolvency resolution process. The Code allows the creditors to change management with 66% votes and approval of the adjudicating authority. This reflects that the inherent conflict between debtors and creditors which was not appropriately addressed in the structure of the PPIRP. \n\nProcedural Flaws\n\nPre-pack as a mechanism is a semi-formal process, where the process begins informally with the corporate debtor initiating the insolvency, submitting a base resolution plan itself and further calling for a meeting with unrelated financial creditors. The timeline for the completion of the entire process is set at 120 days from the admission of the PPIRP application by the Adjudicating Authority. The process is considered semi-formal with minimum state assistance. Nonetheless, the Sub-Committee believed that the Indian market has not sufficiently and sophisticatedly developed to proceed without court approval. However, through the cases discussed below, one can see that Adjudicating Authority is involved at each step, causing unnecessary delay and interference, defeating the purpose of introducing PPIRP as an alternative to CIRP. \n\nThe same is evidenced by the case laws with respect to MSMEs opting for pre-packaging. In the case of GCCL Infrastructure and Projects Limited, the application for initiation of PPIRP was accepted by NCLT Ahmedabad on 14 September 2021. The process should have been completed within 120 days after a nod of the Adjudicating Authority as per Section 54D; however, even after the approval of base resolution plan (BRP) by the Committee of Creditors (CoC), the matter is still pending before the NCLT. The reason for the delay is that the BRP had a merger proposal and questioning the commercial wisdom of CoC, the NCLT is investigating the details of this proposal. \n\nIn the case of Krrish Realtech Private Limited, the court agreed to hear the objections filed by the creditors by invoking Section 424 of the Companies Act 2013. The creditors included in the list and even those excluded had separate reasons to file objections. The court held that by listening to the objections of the creditors, it has not created procedural remedy having substantive outcome on the case. It held that by providing opportunity to the creditors which is explicitly not mentioned in the Code, the court is not creating any procedural remedy and merely invoking its jurisdiction under Companies Act 2013. However, entertaining the creditors at this stage has substantive outcomes in two ways. \n\nFirst, the pre-pack process provides for the Resolution Professional, once appointed, has the duty to check the compliance of previous requirements by the corporate debtor. The Resolution Professional has to prepare an updated list of claims within two days of appointment, even considering the ones not included in the pre-admission stage. The same has been followed in the case of Loon Land Developers Ltd. where the objections regarding the status of the Corporate Debtor as MSME was questioned and the Resolution Professional had the duty of replying to the same. Second, the delay created by considering all the objections at the initial stage pushes the informal process to court, making the 120-day timeline unattainable. \n\nDissonance with the MSME Development Act\n\nThe preamble of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act 2006 (MSMED Act) clarifies that it has been made to facilitate the promotion and development and enhancing the competitiveness of MSMEs and for matters connected and incidental to it. Section 3 of the MSMED Act provides for establishment of a Board and the functions of the Board are to examine, make recommendations for development of these enterprises. The absence of the Board representation on the Sub-Committee formed to develop pre-pack could be reason for the failure to formulate a framework for the needs of MSMEs. The pre-pack model is based on debtor-in-possession model however, the initiation is only possible with the approval of creditors. The creditors would not want to go for voluntary haircut when the pre-pack could be invoked on a default of mere INR 10,00,000. Hence, the Code needs to reevaluate the provisions of the framework and harmonize them with the MSMED Act. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe pre-pack framework was introduced as a semi-formal process as compared to CIRP. However, the cases at hand showcase that it has ended being a court driven process. The voluntary haircuts and inherent conflict between the creditor and debtor could be reasons for fewer initiation under the framework. Further, interference of the court at each step makes the 120-day timeline unachievable. The Code must be revisited to harmonize it with the MSMED Act tailoring to the requirements of the MSME Sector. \nInsolvencyPre-PackMSME\nInsolvency Law\n334 views\n6 likes.

        "content": "Aditya Rao\nJan 13\n6 min read\nSEBI AIF Amendment Regulations 2022: Empowering Investors at the Cost of Weakening Managers' Role?\n[Aditya is a student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.]\n\nAlternative investment funds (AIFs) are private pooled investment vehicles that maintain a highly diversified portfolio and lock-in funds for more extended periods, as opposed to other investments like mutual funds. AIFs incorporated or established in India are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 (AIF Regulations) and are required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Subject to these, AIFs raise capital by pooling large volume investments from Limited Partners, centrally managed by a General Partner— the Manager, who creates a risk profile and plans recurring investments.\n\nAIFs cater to sophisticated investors like high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. As AIFs invest in unlisted securities and unsecured obligations to derive maximum profit percentages for their partners, they are prone to frequent inadequacies of funds or illiquidity. All too often, this exposes investors to mismanagement, diversion of funds for unintended purposes, or even money laundering. Similar incidents include the SEBI Action against Peninsula Brookfield India Real Estate Fund in January 2022. The primary reason for this could be the leeway granted by the AIF Regulations to the Managers.\n\nIdentifying these lacunae, SEBI, through the SEBI (AIF) (Fourth Amendment) Regulations 2022 (Amendment Regulations), has imposed limits and penalties to curb the degree of imminent mismanagement of funds. This was followed by circulars clarifying the same, including the circular on AIF Guidelines for management dated 17 November 2022, and on Foreign Investment in AIFs dated 9 December 2022. This article discusses the Amendment Regulations and their implications, and makes suggestions that could better tackle the practical issues faced by AIFs. \n\nIMPLICATIONS OF THE AMENDMENT REGULATIONS\n\nAt first glance, it is evident that the Amendment Regulations protect individual investors' rights by curbing the amount of leeway granted to Managers, which is welcome. However, a deeper analysis reveals that the bounds placed on Managers could adversely impact investment strategies and the commercial acumen of Managers.\n Ring-Fencing of Assets \n\nUnder the AIF Regulations, an AIF was at liberty to exchange capital across multiple schemes set up by it and placed under the control of the same Manager. Therefore, investors were aggrieved by the maladministration of their investments, which were often used to cover losses in other schemes. The Amendment Regulations inserted Regulation 20(16), which requires Investment Managers to segregate AIF schemes from one another. The amendment seeks to ring-fence assets, liabilities, bank accounts, and securities accounts of distinct schemes by mandating a clear demarcation between the sub-funds so that investors have a clear understanding of allocations during the lock-in period. \n\nThis is a welcome move for foreign investors who wish to ensure they are not exposed to potential litigation in respect of the assets of the scheme in which they invest. Furthermore, the differentiation of fund accounts according to the scheme will also be beneficial from a taxation point of view to the Managers, investors, and authorities, as gains out of each fund account could be taxed proportionately, rather than managers diverting capital across funds to avoid taxes.\n\nFirst Close \n\nSEBI has also amended the AIF Regulations to curb timelines for the first close of funds, which must be done within one year. Earlier, funds were free to lock in large investments for years on end, resulting in enormous losses for the investors but profiting the Manager due to the fee-based services payment structure. Investors, therefore, had no control over when they could recover profits. The Amendment Regulations seek to rectify this loophole by mandating an ascertainable timeline, providing some transparency to investors and regulatory authorities.  \n\nWhile this amendment is aimed at safeguarding investments and providing clarity to investors regarding the tenure of the scheme, it could adversely affect small-time fund Managers who are just venturing into the market and adjusting to the recessionary market, many of whom occasionally have collapsed under pressure, as can be seen from the experience report by an early seed Venture Capital Founder. AIFs also try to defer the launch of their schemes to adhere to various compliances or conduct due diligence studies to assess risks. Putting a blanket timeline for all AIFs would erode investor confidence as risk assessment would be compromised to meet targets. Furthermore, credit assessments would fall, and AIFs would fail to obtain leverage through debt financing.\n\nWhere SEBI has erred in its analysis is placing AIFs at par with mutual funds, which are considerably more regulated and maintain lower risks by raising funds from multiple investors but in smaller chunks. AIFs, like hedge and venture capital funds, typically lock in their investors for a significant period so that risk profits are calculated efficiently. Mutual funds do not undertake such complex strategies and mostly peg the investments to indexes or stocks. Furthermore, it could be said that SEBI is committing a fatal mistake by implementing these timelines on existing funds as well, which will undoubtedly tumble under the pressure of extensive compliance requirements as opposed to the traditionally deregulated AIF marketplace with maximum managerial discretion in the control of fund capital and addition of new partners.\n\nRestrictions on Managers from Withdrawal of Contributions\n\nAccording to AIF Regulations, a fund must have a minimum corpus of INR 20 crores (INR 10 crores for angel funds). Earlier, it was usual practice for Sponsors and Managers to make investment commitments in order to inflate the holdings and project a portfolio that exceeds the minimum requirement. This would immediately be followed by their exit after the close. Through its circular, SEBI has constrained Managers from reducing, withdrawing, or transferring their commitments after the first close to ensure they do not inflate numbers during fundraising to meet the corpus criteria. \n\nAgain, this impacts ventures by small-scale Sponsors, who might need to make personal contributions to meet the stringent thresholds. There may not necessarily be any commercial viability in holding onto Manager's funds, and the discretion of deciding the same must be left to their commercial wisdom. \n\nChange of Control\n\nThrough the amendments to Regulation 20(12) and (13) of the AIF Regulations, SEBI has effectively given a new meaning to 'change of control' in an AIF, requiring prior approval from SEBI and a separate application accompanied with fees. Earlier, when an AIF sought to change its Sponsor and Manager, a majority vote by investors facilitated a swift change of management. This was used to bypass registration requirements as prospective AIFs could acquire an inactive AIF and replace its management instead of undergoing the registration process themselves. However, it may be argued that just as the laws governing companies allow for a determining vote by its members, decisions regarding the administration of funds must be left to the investors and not curbed by regulatory oversight. \n\nAs per the amendment, a fund would have to re-register and pay the hefty fees of INR 5 lakhs, INR 10 lakhs, or INR 15 lakhs, depending on the fund. This levy is therefore concerning as it could detrimentally impact the Managers' performance and deter investors from voting to change control for better management. \n\nCOMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS  \n\nThe analysis undertaken above indicates that the Amendment Regulations could fail to achieve the ideals behind them while also unfairly impacting Managers who have yet to make themselves a name in the market. SEBI and the Hon'ble Supreme Court have emphasized in the Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund Case the fiduciary duty of a Manager owed to investors. The order also stated that only a free and fair manager could allocate funds and make profits for its investors. These amendments would then do little to nothing to remedy such situations. Therefore, the author proposes the following suggestions that could combat the inadequacies of the Amendment Regulations.\n\nInstead of ring-fencing, SEBI could scrutinize fund documents, i.e., the Private Placement Memorandum, and disallow clauses that could contractually limit the operation of the regulations. This would ensure practical compliance. Furthermore, to ensure that there is no tax avoidance or evasion, PAN identifications based on individual fund accounts must be enforced. \n\nCurrently, SEBI considers an AIF to be a separate legal entity under which different schemes are formulated through separate memorandums. Separation of schemes from the umbrella fund could ensure that intra-fund diversion of capital is checked effectively. \n\nClamping down on the investment management skills of Managers would do more harm than good. Regulation on closing down dates could hamper performance to a large extent. It would discourage funds from making long-term investment strategies like credit swaps, which are capital-heavy and require a hedge fund's risk profile.\n\nSEBI also needs to simplify the process for interested investors to request a change in management. In order to safeguard investors of acquired AIFs who have undergone a change of management, there must be stricter guidelines clarifying the position of earlier investors in the new AIF post-change. \n\nWhile these revised amendments are undoubtedly a welcome move ensuring benefits and rights to the investors, the above-cited ambiguities, along with over-regulation, might render them counter-productive.\nSEBIAIFAmendmentSponsorManager\nCorporate Law\n681 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Environment, Social, and Governance Parameters – Mandatory or Directory?",
        "content": "Stuti Agrawal\nJan 4\n5 min read\nEnvironment, Social, and Governance Parameters – Mandatory or Directory?\n[Stuti is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nSustainability is becoming a key priority for businesses across the globe, not just for their legal compliance and branding strategies, but also from a stakeholder welfare perspective. Gone are the days when profitmaking was the only objective of businesses. In view of new regulations, companies are now required to invest in social good while being guided by good corporate governance and ethical business practices. The primary objective of profit-making is visibly being overhauled, even investors realize the value of social impact and public welfare as a core outcome tied to their investments. \nESG for Listed Companies\n\nParticularly, listed companies are required to prepare sustainability reports that disclose information pertaining to their performance on the social, environmental, and governance (ESG) parameters. This extends the meaning of sustainability beyond preserving the environment, by adopting a more holistic approach that requires stakeholders to expand their duties to the social and corporate governance aspects as well. Regulation 34(3) read with Schedule V of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 requires companies to submit disclosures on risks, threats, and concerns pertaining to ESG parameters in their annual reports\n\nThe concept of ESG subsumes within it other stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, and employees – and by default, the company’s investors (or, shareholders).  It may be noted that while ESG reporting was not mandated for the financial year 2023 – 2022, it was nonetheless encouraged as a monitoring and accountability mechanism for all stakeholders. However, ESG reporting is a mandatory requirement for all listed entities from the financial year 2022-23 onwards, by way of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR).\n\nThe BRSR outlines mandatory guidelines and requirements for the top 1000 (one thousand) listed companies, based on the nine main principles from the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (RBI Guidelines). These guidelines revolve around key sustainability matters such as business ethics, transparency, fair labour practices, human rights, and so on. They are framed under the aegis of international standards including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, UN Sustainable Development Goals, Paris Agreement, and the International Labour Organisation Core Conventions. The BRSR aims to secure transparent and uniform disclosures in relation to companies’ ESG-related risks. This would aid in providing guidance to organisations who strive to demonstrate better sustainability aims, increase ability of investors to make informed ESG-driven decisions, and result in long-term value and profit creation.\n\nExamining the BRSR \n\nGood governance is demanded in Principle 1 of the BRSR itself, which states “Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is ethical, transparent and accountable”. This statement itself lays down the broad expectation for businesses to display prudent and ethical behaviour. \n\nFurther, Principle 6 of the BRSR imposes a duty on businesses to preserve the environment. The disclosures pertain to, among others, resource usage, air pollutant emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and impact on biodiversity. The ‘social’ section has been divided into disclosures pertaining to 3 (three) primary stakeholders, that are employees, consumers, and communities envisaged in Principles 3, 9, and 8, respectively. \n\nPrinciple 5 pertains to the duty of businesses to protect all human rights. Therefore, by expanding the ambit of sustainability, it may be said that SEBI seeks to ensure that all universal rights are also preserved. It extends to larger communities affected by business practices. \n\nIt may be argued, therefore, that BRSR is a welcome step in the right direction. This new mandate compels companies to rethink their actions and be more mindful of the effect their business practices have on society at large. It also encourages investors to re-think their investment goals – along with where they would like to channel their money. As a result, most companies have now even started including ESG targets when computing variable pay for their employees. This emanates from investors pushing firms to allocate their funds not just to economic profit, but to non-monetary ends.\n \nA Note on ESG History in India \n\nIt is pertinent to highlight that this is not the first time ESG has been incorporated within the Indian corporate framework. It was first introduced in the Companies Act 2013 under Section 134(3)(m) which mandated companies to include a report on the conservation of energy, along with their financial statements, drafted by their board of directors, taking guidance from the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental, and Economic Responsibilities of Business released in 2011. Rule 8(3)(A) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014 also mandated the board to provide information on energy conservation, including among other disclosures, steps taken towards using alternative energy sources and capital investment towards energy conservation. However, it is important to note that while these provisions mandate ESG disclosures and reporting, they do not demand companies to reveal any processes adopted by them to ensure adherence, nor does it mandate companies to record their progress over time. However, as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) plays a key role as the securities market regulator, it is also bound to protect the interests of stakeholders, and hence, further practical guidance may also be expected from the SEBI on the effective implementation of ESG policies.\n\nIs India Moving towards ESG Adoption? \n\nIn view of an evolving regulatory ESG landscape, prominent Indian companies such as Marico have made ESG a part of their key result areas for top management. Other big names like Tech Mahindra, Infosys, and Wipro are now included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which uses global assessment criteria for ESG parameters. In principle, companies that are a part of this index are considered to follow best ESG practices and inclusion is a clear sign of good ESG practices from an investor and consumer perspective. \n\nWhile India has pioneered the mandate for businesses to lead ethical and responsible practices, other countries continue to develop varying ESG perspectives. In the United States, the US Securities and Exchange Commission mandates all listed companies to disclose environmental compliance expenses. China has seven regulations that govern the ethical practices of companies. The Environmental Information Disclosure Act 2008 mandates corporations to disclose data pertaining to pollution levels, disposal methods, waste generation, and so on. In the European Union (EU), the European Commission (EC) Directive on Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information is the primary governing instrument. It requires large and public-interest companies to submit disclosures on environmental, social, and employee-related matters. The EC constantly modifies the regulations based on changing market practices and human rights considerations. \n\nBased on the EU standards, there are some modifications that the Indian BRSR may consider. The SEBI may conduct further market studies (on a sample basis) for the top 1000 companies bound to conduct BRSR reporting, to enable further specificity in regulation-making. \n\nThe above could enable the SEBI to provide a more standardized framework. Lastly, the most striking aspect is that BRSR does not seek too many explanations for non-compliance with the ESG framework. This might discourage companies from abiding by it, as they are not strictly held responsible for their actions. India may adopt the ‘comply or explain’ model from Singapore, mandating companies to provide bona fide reasons for not complying with ESG requirements. In conclusion, while India has revolutionized the definition of sustainability by widening its ambit to hold companies responsible for not just their financial charts, but even ethical practices, there is a multitude of factors that could enable further improvement and efficiency in the extant framework.\nESGCorporate GovernanceBRSR\nCorporate Law\n349 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "\"Relevant Turnover\" or \"Total Turnover\": Resolving the Obscurity",
        "content": "Aditi Gupta\nJan 2\n5 min read\n\"Relevant Turnover\" or \"Total Turnover\": Resolving the Obscurity\n[Aditi is a student at National Law University, Delhi.]\n\nThe Supreme Court of India (Supreme Court) in its 2017 landmark judgment in Excel Crop Care v. Competition Commission of India (Excel Crop), upheld the Competition Appellate Tribunal’s (COMPAT) decision of imposing a penalty based on \"relevant turnover\", rather than \"total turnover\", settling a crucial question in Indian antitrust law, which was subject to contention amongst various stakeholders. However, a reading of the proviso to Section 27(b) of the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act) elucidates that the legislature’s intention appears to award a penalty on the total turnover of the person or the enterprise, rather than a “relevant” part of such turnover. This article examines the definition of 'turnover' as regards the imposition of penalties under Section 27(b) of the Competition Act, through the lens of corresponding cross-border jurisprudence. \n\nUnderstanding 'Turnover'\n\nThe term 'turnover' under Section 2(y) of the Competition Act includes the “value of sale of goods or services”. Statutorily, there  are no criteria for estimating the turnover to establish the levels that are industry-specific. The whole turnover, not only the turnover for the relevant product market, is what is taken into account. The target exemption notification from 2017 provided adequate guidance regarding the method of calculating the assets of the combining entities, but it only stated that the calculation of turnover \"shall be as certified by the statutory auditor on the basis of the most recent set of audited financial statements of the company.\"\n\nA total fine of INR 2,544 crores was levied on 14 vehicle manufacturers in Shamsher Kataria v. Honda Siel Cars India Limited for abuse of dominance. In this case, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) levied a fine equal to 2% of each vehicle company's average annual turnover for violation of the Competition Act. Further, the COMPAT has stated in the case of Excel Crop that the appropriate measure of punishment in the case of a multi-product company would be only the turnover of the product or service in relation to the alleged contravention, and not the turnover of the entire multi-product company. This is referred to as \"relevant turnover\".\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court to base punishment on a sizable volume of ventures has established a benchmark for the CCI and the COMPAT to determine the penalty for alleged violators of the Competition Act. It has been shown without any doubt that the word 'turnover' refers to actual turnover. The Supreme Court has also provided an illustrative list of factors that should be taken into account while determining the severity of the sentence. As a result, alleged persons have been spared from harsh punishments that may have been disproportionate to their violation.\n\nLaw in Books and Law in Action: Which One to Choose?\n\nIt may be noted that under the Competition Act, the expression 'turnover' is not qualified by the word \"relevant\", nor is it specifically restricted to the product or service of which contravention has been alleged. \n\nFurther, the use of the phrase 'its turnover' in relation to any producer, seller, distributor, dealer, or supplier of services engaged in the cartel indicates that the ground for levying a penalty is the business as a whole, not merely a unit or portion thereof. This argument adheres to the well-known rule of statutory interpretation, as per which if a term appears more than once in a single law provision, the legislator must have intended for the word to have the same meaning in each instance.\n\nHowever, in terms of jurisprudence, the Supreme Court, relying on Abhiram Singh v. CD Commachen, has held the word ‘turnover’ to mean \"the relevant turnover\" under Section 27 of the Competition Act and observed that “if two interpretations are possible, the one that leans in favour of infringer has to be adopted and that the interpretation should not bring about inequitable results”.\n\nForeign Jurisprudence\n\nIn addition to agreeing with the sentiment indicated in the relied-upon decision of the South African Tribunal in Southern Pipeline Contractors v. Competition Commission (Southern Pipeline Contractors), the COMPAT stated that the guidelines of the EU and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)  were \"undoubtedly relevant.\"\n\nIn Southern Pipeline Contractors, the COMPAT ruled that there was a \"legislative link\" between the violation and the harm caused, as well as the profits obtained through cartel activities while interpreting Section 59 of the South African Competition Act, 1998 (SA Act). The South African Court determined that, subject to the overall maximum of 10% of total turnover outlined in Section 59 of the SA Act offered a clear legislative basis for taking just the \"affected\" or the \"relevant\" turnover into consideration. Surprisingly, in Excel Crop, the COMPAT did not examine the provisions of the Competition Act, in particular Section 27, to assess whether the idea of \"relevant turnover\" had any legislative foundation.\n\nThe EU and the OFT guidelines provide that the calculation of the penalty must be done in steps or stages. Arguably, the penalty would have been far higher than what the COMPAT imposed if these regulations had been fully applied to the circumstances of Excel Crop.\n\nA Note on Proportionality\n\nAccording to the proportionality principle, courts may consider leaning towards the \"relevant turnover\" as opposed to the \"total turnover\". \n\nIt may be unconscionable to maintain that even when a penalty has been levied for anti-competitive practices specific to a product, the maximum penalty must always be determined based on \"all the goods,\" or the \"total revenue,\" of the business. In order to impose a penalty under Section 27(b) of the Competition Act, 'turnover' must thus relate to relevant turnover for the infringing product and not the whole turnover of the enterprise/firm. The concept of “relevant turnover” may be further crystallized if this interpretation is embraced.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe clause, being a penal provision, must be strictly interpreted. It is possible that the same infringement is alleged in multiple businesses, some of which may be single product companies while others may be multi-product companies. In such a scenario, there would arguably be no justification for prescribing the maximum penalty based on the total turnover of the business because it would result in prescribing a higher maximum penalty for multi-product businesses. \n\nDue to the fact that the clause relates to penalties to be imposed on \"turnover,\" it is argued that the said 'turnover' was inevitably related to the infringing product solely, and that the legislature never meant to punish any person or enterprise even with respect to non-contentious products. Further, as the Supreme Court held, the imposition of penalty adopting the criteria of “relevant turnover” will be “more in tune with ethos of the Act and the legal principles which surround matters pertaining to imposition of penalties.\"\nCCICompetitionCompetition ActCOMPATTurnover\nCompetition Law\n693 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Analyzing Share Buyback as a Defence in the NDTV Takeover",
        "content": "Basil Gupta, Prithvi Raj Chauhan\nDec 21, 2022\n6 min read\nAnalyzing Share Buyback as a Defence in the NDTV Takeover\n[Basil and Prithvi are students at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nThe recent takeover of New Delhi Television (NDTV) by Adani’s group has become a commercial hot potato. In order to acquire an additional 26% stake in NDTV, Adani’s group launched an open offer which was available from 22 November – 5 December 2022. An open offer is an invitation by the acquirer to the target company’s shareholders to tender their shares for a specific price. This acquisition has been termed as a 'hostile takeover' as 29.18% shares of NDTV had been first acquired by the Adani group without “discussion, consent or notice”.\n\nHostile takeover means acquisition of a company by another corporate group against the wishes of the former. Example: There are two companies A and B. B submits a bid to acquire majority stake in A, however, the Board of Directors of A rejects the offer claiming that it would not be in the best interest of their shareholders. So, now, B could force this deal through a proxy vote, a tender offer, or by buying necessary stocks of company A in the open market. In the present case, Adani’s group has done so by acquiring necessary stocks in NDTV. \n\nHowever, NDTV could probably have used the method of buyback of shares in order to counter this hostile takeover. Section 68 of the Companies Act 2013 prescribes buyback of shares as a tool of protection in corporate governance to prevent hostile takeovers.\n\nLegal Justification for Buyback\n\nThe commercial viability of buyback may differ according to changing market circumstances. The process may be anew to Indian corporates, but the rationale behind buyback in the context of a takeover is that the company keeps the shares which it buys back, so that fewer shares are available for purchase in the market, which in turn results into each investor’s share of ownership going up. Thus, an acquirer is prevented from taking over the company. The present article discusses the viability of buyback in the NDTV takeover vis-à-vis Section 68 of the Companies Act 2013 and the SEBI (Buy-Back of Securities) Regulations 2018 which currently regulate the procedure of buybacks in India. \n\nSection 68 and SEBI Regulations 2018: A Proportional Barrier or Burden? \n\nThe relevant regulations for buyback were enacted by SEBI under powers conferred under SEBI Act 1992, thereby amending the earlier regulations of buyback. The new regulations have defined the term ‘buyback period’ to bring more clarity in the provisions of Section 68 and ensure better compliance. Secondly, the regulations have been made more in line with the main provision under the Companies Act i.e., Section 68, to avoid any conflict between the two. \n\nThe regulations have made the buyback process more inclusive by allowing for unregistered shareholders to take part in the process. They rightly allow converting the cash proportion of escrow account to an interest-bearing one, given that the merchant banker guarantees that the funds are available when shareholders are paid. This would keep the money flowing with interest bearing, thereby encouraging shareholders to sell their shares to the company. However, effecting the reduction of share-capital of company has been mandated as a precursor to buyback of shares.\n\nThe new regulations have effectively balanced public interest by not giving the company too much space to use buyback to misrepresent financials and share values of the company. Simultaneously, they have allowed changes to encourage shareholders to sell back their shares to make the process easier. \n\nGiving effect to a buyback which is generally used to lift low share prices does require some free hand to entities to incentivise their shareholders to return their stake to the company. However, any more discretion than that given under Section 68 and the relevant SEBI regulations could allow for misuse of the practice becoming a major concern of public interest in case of listed companies. Therefore, the provisions under Section 68 and the regulations provide a proportional safeguard to keep the practice of buyback in check.\n\nAnalysis of Legal Process of Buyback through the NDTV Case Study\n\nThe process of buyback given under Section 68 and the SEBI Regulations provides for different requirements at each stage of buyback for it to be given legal effect. The process has been discussed below by analysing whether NDTV could have gone for buyback of its shares as a defence against the takeover bid by Adani group.\n\nNDTV Takeover\n\nNDTV was taken by surprise when the Adani group took control of Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL) which had convertible warrants amounting to 29.18% equity capital in NDTV by way of a loan extended to NDTV by VCPL back in 2009 through Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Holding Private Limited. The Adani group by acquiring VCPL converted all the warrants to shares, thereby acquiring more than 25% control in the company. This obligated the Adani group to make an offer of 26% shares of NDTV in the open market as per the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011.  \n\nPossibility of Buyback: Counter to Adani’s Offer\n\nNDTV could have made buyback of shares through three processes – tender process, open market and odd lot process. As the process of odd lot shares buyback is not backed with past practice by any major entity, it could be precarious to make the repurchase from an odd lot of shares which could mean more problems for the media giant. \n\nThe other process i.e. buyback through open market would allow for only making 15% offer of the equity capital as SEBI regulation provides for only offering 15% of paid-up share capital as buyback in open market. NDTV’s paid up share capital as of 2022 is 25.8 crores out of 173.3 crores [approx.] which equates to its 100% shareholding. Hence, NDTV could only make an offer up to 3.87 crores [15% of paid-up capital] which would be substantially less than Adani group’s open offer of 26% shares. Thus, the only option left with NDTV was to go for buyback through tender process where they could buy shares from existing shareholders on a proportional basis through tender offer. \n\nAs Adani group already has 29% equity retrieved from promoter shareholding of NDTV through conversion of warrants into shares, the media group would have needed to buy back at least 20% shares through tender process to gain back majority stake in the company. For giving legal effect to this process, the entity would have had to work through the procedure under Section 68 of the Companies Act along with the SEBI (Buy-Back of Securities) Regulations 2018.\n\nRequirements of Buyback\n\nThe process of tender buyback of shares would have firstly needed an authorisation under the Articles of Association (AoA) of NDTV, and if the AoA does not provide such prior authorisation, the same would have had to be added through alteration of the AoA under Section 14 of the Companies Act 2013. Subsequently, a board resolution would have had to be approved for the tender buyback. As the company would have had to make a substantial offer as a counter to Adani’s open offer, the same would have required a special shareholder resolution under Section 68(2)(b) of the Companies Act 2013, requiring more than 75% votes by shareholders. \n\nThe requirement of special resolution would have created an inevitable stop for the NDTV buyback as the Adani group is already in control of 29% equity which makes it able to halt any special resolution passed to such effect. Even assuming that NDTV would have been able to pass a resolution to that effect, it would have had to comply with other ancillary requirements under Section 68 including but not limited to material disclosure and necessity of buyback at tabling resolution, intimating SEBI, the Central Government and the Registrar of Companies before and after the buyback.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe essential requirements and difficulty in passing the resolution due to major pie of equity being with the Adani group would have made it materially impossible for NDTV to make a successful buyback offer before several months’ time-period. It was a given fact that the Adani group’s open offer only stood from 22 November to 5 December 2022. Hence, any possible offer of buyback would not have been possible to be made as counteroffer against the group in such limited time period. \n\nThe above analysis of NDTV making a possible counter bid of buyback demonstrates that even if the practice of buyback is financially viable and suitable for a company in a given situation, the stringent regulations in place can become a bee sting for entities wanting to complete the buyback process expeditiously. The regulations behind the buyback process safeguard public interest and the interest of shareholders. However, when entities in good faith want to expedite the process, there should be some space for companies to do the same subject to approval of the SEBI and the Central Government.\n\nSEBINDTVBuybackCompanies ActTakeover\nCorporate Law\n620 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "India's Guidelines for Finfluencers: Key Elements for Consideration",
        "content": "Harshit Meena\nDec 19, 2022\n5 min read\nIndia's Guidelines for Finfluencers: Key Elements for Consideration\n[Harshit is a student at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nThe rise of social media has also launched financial influencers amongst other types of influencers. Financial influencers (finfluencers) offer information, opinion, and advice on financial topics such as stocks, mutual funds etc. primarily over social media. Plenty of consumers view finfluencers' content which greatly affects their investment decisions. Further, financial companies through finfluencers advertise their financial products and services. \n\nIt can be said that finfluencers have a prominent say with an eminent voice in the financial industry, but interestingly, their conduct is unregulated in India. In numerous instances, finfluencers are not qualified to provide financial information and end up disseminating false financial information which leads to flawed financial decisions by the public. Due to lack of regulation, such influencers extricate themselves with zero liability. To address this issue, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is on the path of regulating such influencers and is in the works to release guidelines for finfluencers as stated by one of SEBI’s whole-time directors in an event.  \n\nGuidelines for finfluencers should accommodate a set of elements for their efficient implementation. Countries such as Australia, China, Germany have efficiently enshrined them. SEBI’s guidelines should take note of certain policy considerations and can draw inspiration from such countries. In the article, the author sheds light on such key elements and how they can be implemented by SEBI. Further, the author provides concluding remarks while devising solution for establishing quality check on finfluencers. \n\nAccommodation of Key Elements \n\nIt is pertinent for SEBI to enshrine the following elements that have been enlisted by numerous countries in their guidelines for finfluencers. \n\nAn unambiguous definition of financial advice\n\nFinfluencers produce an assortment of financial content ranging from a simple interpretation of financial terms to providing opinions on a company’s public offer. Hence an important question that arises is, what truly constitutes as financial advice by a finfluencer?\n\nAn advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or  investment  products, and advice on investment portfolios containing securities or investment products, whether written, verbal or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client, has been termed as 'investment advice' under Regulation 2(1)(l) of the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations 2013. But the regulation explicitly exempts advice given through social media by finfluencers. \n\nSuch category of advice is covered under SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations 2014 (SEBI Research Analyst Regulations) through research report under Regulation 2(1)(w). Unfortunately, financial advice from a finfluencer will be excluded from its ambit, as a research report can be provided only by a certified research analyst by SEBI which requires a post graduate degree from National Institute of Securities Markets under Regulation 7(1)(iii). Hence, no Indian legislation or guidelines provide a concise definition of 'financial advice' that is applicable over the information provided by finfluencers. \n\nNumerous countries under their guidelines for finfluencers have lucidly defined 'financial advice'. Australia has established guidelines for finfluencers through Information Sheet 269, under which financial product advice has been clearly defined. Further, European Securities and Markets Authority on similar lines has defined 'investment recommendations'. On such lines, SEBI should clearly establish the definition of 'financial advice' under its guidelines. \n\nMandatory disclosures in advertisement \n\nFinance influencer marketing industry is on a boom due to which numerous financial companies approach finfluencers for advertisement of their financial products and services. These finfluencers carry out such advertisement without disclosing their affiliation with such brands and compensation that they receive. In numerous instances, such companies and their financial products and services turn out to be a scam which results in grave financial damage to the consumers that utilize such services on the recommendation of such finfluencers. Further, such finfluencers easily wiggle out of such scenarios with zero liability for their actions. SEBI’s Research Analyst Regulations under Regulation 19 mandates research analysts to disclose their financial interest and any form of compensation received from the company whose financial products and services are being advertised. Since the regulation governs only a specific bracket of research analysts which are registered with SEBI, finfluencers will fall outside the ambit of the regulation. \n\nThe Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has established guidelines for social media influencers which mandate disclosure label over the content for financial service companies as an advertisement. In reality, however, the ASCI guidelines have no impact over finfluencers as ASCI does not hold any power to penalize finfluencers for breach. It merely holds the power to refer such breach to the concerned regulatory authority. \n\nCountries such as Germany have established strict guidelines that mandate finfluencers to disclose their relationship with financial companies in the event of advertisement of the company’s financial product or service. Germany’s Unfair Competition Act, through Section 5a(6), mandates finfluencers to label their content created for financial services companies as 'advertisement' for which they receive compensation. Such view has been upheld by German Federal Supreme Court in numerous judicial precedents. Further, Article 2 of the Delegated Regulation on Market Abuse mandates finfluencers to disclose the name of the financial company for which the advertisement is being carried out. \n\nIt is pertinent for SEBI to draft guidelines that mandate finfluencers to disclose their relationship with  financial services companies while advertising their financial service and to provide disclosure label as “advertisement”. This will at least provide consumers with a clear knowledge that the information on the product is being given out as an advertisement and not as an independent opinion of the finfluencer.  \n\nQuality checks over finfluencers\n\nCountries such as Australia and China have developed efficient quality checks over finfluencers. In Australia, finfluencers are mandated to possess Australian financial services (AFS) license for providing financial product advice pursuant to Section 911A of Corporations Act 2001. Similarly, China through Article 13 of Code of Conduct for Internet Hosts dated 22 June 2022, has established that for content pertaining to finance that requires a higher degree of professionalism, the influencers should obtain the corresponding professional qualifications, and only in such circumstances can they be allowed to live stream or publish their opinions online. SEBI can draw a lesson from such countries and inculcate such mechanisms in its own guidelines.\n\nConclusion \n\nIndian finfluencers cannot be left unregulated as they hold the potential to affect investment decisions and trends of massive online consumers and it’s the call of the hour to monitor such influencers. SEBI has timely addressed this alarming call and has set out to draft guidelines for finfluencers. The author humbly submits that it is pertinent to establish a quality check on finfluencers which ensures that individuals who possess sufficient educational and professional qualifications in the financial field are permitted to provide financial advice. A system of checks and balances needs to be established by SEBI under its guidelines.  \nInfluencersSocial MediaSEBIFinancial Advice\nCorporate Law\n600 views\n5 likes. Post not marked as liked\n5"

        "title": "Addressing the Ambiguity of FRAND Terms: An Indian Perspective",
        "content": "Harshit Meena\nNov 27, 2022\n6 min read\nAddressing the Ambiguity of FRAND Terms: An Indian Perspective\n[Harshit is a student at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nIn today’s modern economy, ‘standard’ is the bread and butter of every industry ranging from 4G and 5G technology in telecommunications to even the staple usage of A4-sized paper. A standard can be understood as a set of technical specifications and procedures applicable to products, processes,  services, or systems, and which is aimed at ensuring a common design or method of operation  to achieve optimum reliability and effectiveness. \n\nA standard mandates the usage of a specific technology in the production of products. Such technology which is already patented and is “essential” to be used in a product in compliance with the set standard is classified as Standard Essential Patent (SEP).  \n\nThe licensing of SEPs to the implementers may lead to anti-competitive practices by the ultimate SEP license holders. The reason behind such anti-competitive practices can be traced to the commitment of SEP holders to license their SEPs on seemingly fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) which can, in practice, be read as vague and unclear.\n\nIn view of the above, Part I of the article discusses the anti-competitive conduct often demonstrated by SEP license holders. Subsequently, Part II offers some solutions and suggestions to tackle the issues surrounding SEP licensing and anti-competitive conduct.  \n\nAmbiguous FRAND Terms and Anti-competitive Use of SEPs  \n\nA licensed SEP’s core features are exclusivity and essentiality, since the usage of SEP becomes mandatory and no alternative to such patent can be used under the standard set by standard-setting organizations (SSO). \n\nThe exclusive and essential nature of the SEP creates a monopoly in the hands of the SEP holder over the production and distribution of such technology, which in turn may put such holder in a dominant position, vis-à-vis other market players not having free access to the underlying technology in an SEP. The SEP holder can exercise their monopoly and dominance in such a market in an anti-competitive manner such as to license such SEPs at arbitrarily high royalty rates or completely refuse to license such SEPs to implementers. Such anti-competitive practices are detrimental to the  innovation in the specific industry,  consumers owing to restricted competition (and therefore the production of goods and/or rendering or services), and the overall macroeconomic health of the country. \n\nIn this regard, SSOs play a crucial role to avert such situations. All SSOs mandate SEP holders to license SEPs to the implementers on FRAND terms. However, the ambiguity of FRAND commitments may allow SEP holders to continue to engage in anti-competitive practices which are detrimental to the industry. \n\nFRAND Terms and Its Ambiguity: Cause for Concern \n\nAs noted above, the FRAND terms directed by the SSOs are plagued by ambiguity. SSOs either do not define, or do not provide an interpretation of FRAND terms. This leads to a highly subjective application of the FRAND terms. Further, these SSOs do not define the manner of determining royalty rates and license terms, leading to possible disparities in the terms and conditions for SEP licensing, for similar patents.\n\nThe consequences of such ambiguity can be witnessed in the practice of SEP licensing wherein SEP holders abuse their dominant position and commit anti-competitive practices. Numerous judicial precedents under Indian competition law can illustrate such abuse of dominance. \n\nDominant Position by SEP Holders \n\nThe dominant position held by an SEP license holder may be addressed under Section 4(2) of The Competition Act 2002 ( Competition Act). SEP holders, due to the patent’s exclusivity, may not face any competition from their competitors (in terms of SEP usage) till such patent is made freely accessible. Hence, SEP holders’ position in the relevant market may qualify as a “dominant position” upon the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) determination under Section 4(1) of the Competition Act. \n\nAbuse of dominant position through exorbitant royalty rates and unfair terms\n\nThe existing ambiguities in FRAND terms may provide SEP holders to licence their SEPs at exorbitant royalty rates and subject unfair terms which is detrimental to the implementers & consumers. The imposition of such exorbitant royalty rates & unfair terms may attract claims of anti-competitive conduct and abuse of dominance, under the Competition Act. \n\nIn Micromax Informatics Limited v Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Ericsson charged Micromax exorbitant and unjustified royalty rates for its SEPs in GSM technology used in mobile handsets. The royalty rates were charged on the price of the phone in which the SEP was being used instead of charging on the actual value of the technology being implemented. Such high rates may lead to high barriers to entry, and lead to adverse effects on competition. The CCI held such royalty rates as contrary and violative to FRAND terms. \n\nFurther, in Best IT World (India) Private Limited v. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson for the purpose of establishing SEP licence, Ericsson and iBall to agree to a non-disclosure agreement wherein arising disputes between the parties were to be settled through arbitration in Stockholm, Sweden which debarred iBall to adjudicate disputes in the jurisdiction where it carried out its business. CCI held such terms as unfair and concluded such conduct as an abuse of dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act. \n\nPolicies on the Elaboration of FRAND Terms: Need of the Hour \n\nAnti-competitive practices in relation to SEP licensing will continue to rise at higher rates if the issue of ambiguity around FRAND terms remains unaddressed. Such practices are detrimental to a healthy competition culture which CCI strives to achieve and maintain. However, it may be noted that SSOs and nations have started to address such issues by publishing guidelines and policies which elaborate upon FRAND terms. \n\nThe CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement on Core Principles and Approaches for Licensing of Standard Essential Patent is an example which aims to reduce the ambiguity around FRAND terms. These policies may work to answer the pertinent question, which is what FRAND entails. \n\nFurther, India may consider drawing a lesson from these policies and establishing  an independent set of domestic guidelines and policies that elaborate upon FRAND terms.\n\nCEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement over SEP’s and FRAND Terms \n\nThe agreement drafted by European Committee for Standardization and the European Committee for Electro-technical Standardization enunciate key behaviours and best practices that ensure compliance with FRAND terms in SEP licensing. The agreement consists of 6 core principles within  SEP licensing. \n\nCore principle 2 covers non-discrimination under FRAND and mandates that an SEP license should be made available to all the interested implementers of such SEP. Further, a refusal to license to certain implementers will be seen as “anti-thesis” to FRAND. Section 3.4 (b) of the agreement further elaborates on this principle and states that discriminatory pricing and royalties constitute a breach of FRAND terms. \n\nCore principle 3 and section 3.4 (a)(3) elaborate upon the setting of royalty rate under FRAND terms. They enunciate that the royalty rate should reflect the value of the patented invention that it brings to the smallest component and not the end product under which such technology is being implemented. \n\nGood faith negotiation guidelines \n\nThe parties contracting under an SEP licence may ascertain, through review and deliberations, whether the SEP license is FRAND compliant. When negotiations are done in bad faith by the SEP holder, an abuse of dominant position and higher bargaining power is witnessed wherein the weaker bargaining power of the implementer is taken advantage of in the form of intentional delay in negotiations and imposition of higher royalties for SEPs. On the other hand, negotiations done in good faith by the parties may ensure a successful SEP licence where the terms of such licence are FRAND compliant. \n\nNumerous states such as Japan and USA have recognized the importance of establishing guidelines for ensuring good faith negotiations in SEP license negotiations. Japan rolled out its guidelines titled Good Faith Negotiation Guidelines for Standard Essential Patent Licenses on 31 March 2022. The USA is also in the works to roll out a policy that enumerates guidelines for SEP negotiations. It has released a draft policy statement and has invited reviews for the same. \n\nThe guidelines in such jurisdictions set the following standards for good-faith negotiations: \n\nThe SEP holder should present an offer for an SEP license in compliance with FRAND in good faith to the implementer. Under such an offer, the holder should supplement all the necessary information regarding its SEP. \nThe implementer after receiving such an offer, should assess the information and decide in good faith. The implementer can present a counteroffer to the holder in good faith. Further, the SEP holder should respond to such counteroffers and clarifications within a reasonable amount of time. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe issue of ambiguity around FRAND terms & anti-competitive practices in SEP licensing can lead to damaging consequences towards India’s MAKE IN INDIA initiative since such anti-competitive practices can deter Indian manufacturers to enter and manufacture indigenous products, reliant on access to SEPs. \n\nIt is the need of the hour is to take initiative towards the removal of the ambiguity of FRAND terms which efficiently address the issue of anti-competitive practices in SEP licensing by SEP holders. \n\nCCI can draw inspiration from policies such as CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement and Good Faith Negotiation Guidelines released by Japan and USA. On such lines, the CCI should consider working towards establishing its own set of guidelines and policies that elaborate upon FRAND terms. Such guidelines can serve as the touchstone over which SEP negotiations can occur and  FRAND-compliant terms and royalty rates of SEP licence can be achieved. \n\nThe constant innovations in technology will bring a rise in SEPs accompanied by higher number of SEP disputes. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for SEP disputes is an efficient alternative to lengthy, and  resource-consuming SEP litigation. SEP ADR may ensure a confidential and quicker resolution to the dispute between the parties. Further, the CCI may consider establishing a special institution for the SEP ADR framework, which is enforced by, among others, subject matter experts.\nCompetition ActCCIFRANDSEP\nCompetition Law\n825 views\n4 likes.

        "content": "Sidharrth Shankar\nNov 26, 2022\n4 min read\nHEAL India First? The Misses!\n[Sidharrth is a Partner at JSA. The following article was published in Express Pharma and on Lexology.]\n\nThe ‘Heal In India’ initiative may have several pros and wins, but being alert to the cons is even more potent. Cognizance of the impact on the overall approach towards the Indian healthcare model is crucial. My first piece was on the hits. Part II of my piece on Heal In India cuts across the misses that needs to be looked at.\n\nLet's Face Facts\n\nAffordability and Accessibility are the two most deadly threats that deter the healthcare sector in India. This further leads to an inequitable scope of treatment for citizens nationwide. The minimal 2.1% of our GDP that is committed to affordability is a staggering low as compared with the 9.7% in the case of OECD countries. Moreover, more than 50% of healthcare expenses in India are borne by citizens pushing the 55 million poverty-stricken further down the abyss. Today’s infrastructure record has about 28% of the urban population with access to 66% of the beds in hospitals. The remaining 72% has access to only 33% of hospital beds. In the case of the medical fraternity, 67% of doctors are concentrated in the urban areas.\n\n'Glorified' Western Models\n\nThat India has yet a lot to learn about healthcare delivery models and systems is a given. However, India has two successful models in the West for valuable lessons. One is the insurance-based model predominant in the US. The other is the UK’s state-controlled National Health Service (NHS) model. It would benefit India to study the positives and drawbacks of both the models to ascertain the features that best fit the Indian polity of states, culture, business aspects and the healthcare delivery.\n\nThe Government is doing all to build on the medical education base by bringing in more colleges, new healthcare plans and reforms that will encourage a higher output of medical talent. However, this effort requires a multiplicity of regulatory checks in the education foreground, where merely the cheque-and-fee model should not be the deciding factor. Outgoing medical graduates, postgraduates, doctors, healthcare professionals, experts, etc., should be screened at various levels before they serve the nation or the rest of the world.\n\nIndia's Health Interests\n\nHealthcare workforce challenges have taken centre-stage in discussion and debate since a long time now. India’s health interests call for serious scrutiny - its political or geopolitical aspects, and sometimes even the cultural mishaps.\n\nSadly, the Pradhan Mantri schemes, which make the headlines, do not prioritize health care. While it is true that the provision of tap water, housing, electricity, and roads is essential, the crying need is for healthcare advocacy and implementation of the healthcare at the grassroots level.\n\nSimilarly, while the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and the Heal in India initiatives aim to streamline the country’s integrated digital health infrastructure, the ever-increasing healthcare needs of the neglected masses is overlooked. For instance, while the innovative thought of building an online repository of healthcare professionals will enable foreign patients to access the best-suited treatment line; this in no way resolves the ongoing crisis for a country already struggling with affordable healthcare for its own citizens.\n\nExchange Best Practices, Not Professionals\n\nSince COVID-19 brought the world to its knees, nations have supported one another with life-saving vaccinations and medical kits. However, the fine line between the import/ export of products and healthcare professionals may have been ignored and taken for granted. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in the 1990s also aimed to create a liberal healthcare world, and the results were criticized globally.\n\nA similar impact is caused by an over-dose of medical tourism. When a country's limited healthcare resources are exploited or, more precisely, stretched to the utmost to serve the healthcare needs of stakeholders other than its own citizens, it is nothing short of a massive dent in the country’s health equity. Though such initiatives for growth cannot be belittled, policies that imbalance priorities are a concern.\n\nHealthcare Registry, Not Repository is the Need\n\nApart from the plus in providing foreign stakeholders easy access to the right treatment matches, a healthcare repository of professionals offers no other answers to any of India’s cries for healthcare demand or supply. India has neither a strong supply side nor a weak demand base that would benefit from such a repository.\n\nInstead, a Registry is required at the national, urban, and rural levels to address the mounting healthcare challenges which are manpower, access, affordability, etc. Such a Registry, coupled with strong public healthcare initiatives, is the urgent need for India’s current healthcare sector.\n\nA Self-Imposed Brain Drain?\n\nThe online National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) being planned and built robustly by the National Health Authority (NHA) will require Health Care Professionals (HCPs) to upload their professional details and achievements along with their preferred destinations. This will give foreigners a ready list of hospitals available for the most appropriate healthcare services. About 42 allied healthcare services that have been on offer via this portal have been identified, offering professionals access to serve foreign patients in the country of their choice.\n\nAs I said earlier, it is time for prioritizing our nations healthcare needs and move in the right direction for ‘Heal In India’ first and then ‘Heal by India’.\nHeal in IndiaHealthcareAyushman BharatNational Health Authority\nLaw and Policy\n60 views\n3 likes.

        "content": "Sidharrth Shankar\nNov 26, 2022\n7 min read\nWill Christmas Spell Cheer at Downing Street?\n[Sidharrth is a Partner at JSA. The following article was published in The Indian Express and on Lexology.]\n\nThe India-UK free trade agreement (FTA), one of the topmost priorities for the Indian bureaucracy at work, was ready for sign-off at Diwali. However, the definitive plans were derailed by the sudden resignation of the then UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss. All eyes are now tensely focused on whether her successor, Rishi Sunak, the first Indian-origin prime minister of the UK, will bring fresh energy to the India-UK FTA, which has been stalled by the change in UK’s leadership.\n\nThe positive sentiment and zeal around the India-UK FTA are as ambitious as is the commitment to double bilateral trade by 2030. It is worth noting the exciting watch-and-chase between the respective governments on the preferred personal stance on aspects such as the Ukraine crisis, given that the outgoing PM Boris Johnson was a strong supporter of the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky. Similarly, the New Delhi corridors have been closely monitoring how the new British government pushes forward in respect of the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nDual Passion\n\nThe last six chapters of the 26-chapter talk on trade agreement touched a sensitive timeline where both sides deal with what remains uppermost in their trade aspirations. Cases in point are consensus to be reached in respect of automobiles for the UK while for India the issues remain mobility of professionals and students, and bolstering labour-driven sectors such as leather, textiles, jewellery, agricultural and marine products, pharmaceuticals and healthcare.\n\nThe British have been passionately aspiring to wrestle with the hiccups that the UK has been encountering while exporting to India. Smoother access to the Indian consumer's wallets has also stirred excitement. Added to their wishlist are significant tariff cuts for whisky and cars, and more penetration into digital and legal services.\n\nThe agenda has more: the UK is also excited to explore transport, electricals, medical devices, chemicals, motor parts, fruits, vegetables, etc. Similarly, the Indian list of trade aspirations also mentions exporting food and beverages, textiles, tobacco, leather and footwear, and agricultural items.\n\nHistorically, ever since Brexit, India and the UK have been striving to strengthen their ties. These efforts have been directed towards 'strategic partnership' based on 'democracy', 'fundamental freedom', and a rule-based 'international order'.\n\nDuring Boris Johnson's visit to India this year, both sides were interested in expanding the existing defence and security partnership in addition to the UK setting up an India-centric general export licensing regime to reduce the delivery time for defence-related procurements.\n\nTo fortify the forces at play, the UK parliament has set up a cross-party panel – 'India (Trade and Investment) All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG)' to foster ongoing negotiations and achieve the goals on the anvil.\n\nIn addition to the APPG, the duo has also set up a committee that will focus on discussing a totalization agreement sought by New Delhi, which will ease the social security compliances for Indian IT companies as also eliminate dual social security taxation. Further, India seeks market access to the UK legal services sector to reciprocate the same entry by way of liberalization of the Indian counterpart.\n\nIs India Inc. Ready?\n\nA crucial point that the cross-party committee has also claimed was India's readiness in terms of law, culture, and regulatory aspects, which will need a sea change to adapt to the new objectives being laid out in the FTA. Given India's \"historically protectionist policies,\" any change in the legal and regulatory undercurrents could lead to a longer timeframe for ease of doing business in India under the FTA.\n\nIn addition, concerns cited about businesses that require so-called \"facilitation payments\", complex tax and business setup, contract enforcement aspects, limited IP scopes, etc. are also low-level benchmarks.\n\nThe House of Commons International Agreements Committee has questioned the timelines for the India-UK FTA's conclusion. It stressed the possibility of haste leading to missing out a good deal and merely achieving ambition over valuable content.\n\nNot A Cakewalk!\n\nThe India-UK FTA's success depends on many factors protected by the respective nations, and its global trade exposure has been kept under wraps. Hence, both countries will face significantly sensitive barriers in respect of action being in the spirit of the FTA. For instance, India’s highly protected sectors such as wines and automobiles are the subject of much debate. Similarly, enabling easy entry norms for students and professionals in the UK will be fraught with difficulty.\n\nSecondly, both the nations need to arrive at a common ground in terms of product standards and technical qualifications of their varsities. Without considerable manoeuvring to this end, the FTA could never achieve aspired outcomes.\n\nThirdly, India's aggressive approach towards signing up FTAs worldwide and now with the UK also showcases a clear picture of what it expects from the trading systems in addition to access to the assets of its vital services sector.\n\nWindow Shopping of FTAs?\n\nSince Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), the UK has been on a fast-paced dialogue with nations like India to sign trade deals and agreements. Currently, the UK would have completed about 68 such deals, including one with the EU. Similarly, the Indian powerbrokers have struck trade deals with Mauritius, Australia, and the UAE while being in talks with the EU, Canada, and other nations.\n\nIndia’s economic necessities ended its decade-long break from FTAs, leading to a sudden splurge that endowed it with the stature of one of the world’s nations most engaged in FTAs. It has come full circle in its FTA trajectory with the numerous negotiations it has signed within two years, including deals with Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian nations). With the spirit and encouragement drawn from the Look East Policy, these have been an obvious show of strength by India over the years.\n\nNonetheless, the Indian industry stakeholders and policy authorities have several concerns, given the sharp rise in imports in comparison to exports.\n\nProtectionist Fears - The Interplay\n\nIt is relevant to remember that, over the last decade, several protectionist fears stemmed from negotiations with the EU, Australia, and Canada that were not in full swing. Further, the best litmus test may be quoting the withdrawal from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - an agreement involving the ASEAN economies, Australia, Japan, Korea, China, New Zealand, and India back in November 2019.\n\nUnderstanding the 'Knee Jerk'\n\nScrutiny of the trigger to this sudden U-turn on FTAs as also similar trade deals and agreements has revealed that while several economic and geo-political factors may engulf India, the major critical pointers have been safeguarding supply chains and diversifying its sources. Hence, India has chosen to dilute its reliance on FTAs and focus on diversifying its sources overall.\n\nCOVID-19 has been a timestamp for the world to learn anew. Globally, nations have known that essential products and the grasp over their supply chains are a key in the world’s ever-changing scenario today. This undoubtedly led to an impetus in the overall thought process to look outwards, disrupting the traditional trade channels that existed erstwhile.\n\nSecondly, COVID-19 also led to several geo-political disturbances, such as the US-China conflicts, which caused tremors worldwide, engendering a multipolar world comprised of country alliances of varied shapes and sizes. However, India has succeeded in becoming an active member in new forums such as the Quad and Indo-Pacific wireframes, and has affinity to the G7, given its common grounds of supply chains, clean energy, etc.\n\nGeo-Politics in the Absence of Geo-Economics?\n\nRecently, India has been focusing on many geo-political developments in the Indo-Pacific with distinct flair and adequate exposure. It has moved centre stage by setting aside the military aspects of the Quad. It has also ensured that the ASEAN states are comfortable with the power dynamics in progress.\n\nWhere is New Delhi Going Wrong?\n\nIn simple terms, notwithstanding the aggression geo-politically, the Indo-Pacific geo-economic metrics are a major dampener. Clearly, the machinery has turned a blind eye to the inevitable bridges between geo-politics and geo-economics concepts. As a result, irrespective of how strong India may be on its physical boundaries, it has reverted to the same old sauce with regard to the economics attached.\n\nSteering towards the Indo-Pacific and the Quad in a celebratory manner while nodding out from the region's critical multilateral trade agreements determines how the two undercurrents are not complementing each other. India's refusal of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is a US-sponsored soft trade mechanism. This came about a couple of years after India had backed out of the negotiations on the RCEP, which went into effect earlier this year. Both agreements are critical milestones in determining the region’s economic souls.\n\nTherefore, the question that arises is: by staying out of the IPEF and RCEP, is New Delhi extending an explicit handshake to bilateral agreements alone?\n\nThe Plus in a Bilateral Brush of Powers Only\n\nFirst is the apparent fear of domination by Chinese markets in times to come. If this were to happen, it is preferable to be prepared to face the challenge head on, even if this entails incurring costs in the short term. Irrespective of the military stand-off on the LAC, India-China trade has only escalated. It is therefore better to deal with the issue more comprehensively. India could consider multilateral trade arrangements that may or may not involve a Chinese presence.\n\nSecondly, opting to stay out of IPEF was not in India’s best interest as it will be challenging for the country to merge itself into regional and global supply chains without being an element of the crucial regional multilateral trading agreements.\n\nThirdly, India has no option other than to address the challenges that create hassles for investments in India. Though a handful of international firms may have closed their operations in China due to tensions with the US, yet they have not turned to India for their new setups, opting instead for Vietnam. This is fair warning that India is yet to gear itself for such opportunities. Being a part of multilateral trading arrangements will pave the way for rewarding participation.\n\nFourthly, India will need to take a call on its approach toward a grand maritime strategy. Given that it cannot rely only on military forces, it needs to get the regional states to create economic stakes in India with reciprocal effect. China has done this successfully. This again calls for India to tie up with central non-regional states and integrate with their supply chains.\n\nClearly, securing trade agreements between the UK and India will strengthen the economic links between the two nations, helping both recover lost ground in key services that suffered from the pandemic. At the same time, the power dynamics on both sides must be carefully assessed.\nFTARCEPIPEFTrade\nTrade Law\n51 views\n2 likes. Post not marked as liked\n2"

        "title": "Interpreting Rainbow Papers: What is a Statutory Charge?",
        "content": "Pratyush Singh\nNov 15, 2022\n6 min read\nInterpreting Rainbow Papers: What is a Statutory Charge?\n[Pratyush is a student at National Law School of India University, Bangalore.]\n\nRecently, in State Tax Officer (1) v. Rainbow Papers Limited (Rainbow Papers), the Supreme Court of India ruled that if the proposed resolution plan does not take into account the statutory dues payable to a governmental entity, the Adjudicating Authority is bound to reject the said plan. A necessary consequence of this judgment is that if the company is not in a position to pay its statutory dues as part of its debt, it would be compelled to go under liquidation as stipulated under Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). This position has been criticized by various authors for going against the settled jurisprudence of treating government dues as subordinate to secured creditors. While the judgment obviously merits a review, this article attempts to present a narrower interpretation of the Rainbow Papers judgment such that not every governmental entity claiming a statutory due is equated to the status of a ‘secured creditor’. \n\nSettled Position Prior to the Judgment\n\nCourts/tribunals in India have faced similar situations before wherein they had to consider the priority of statutory dues under customs law, income tax law, etc. as compared to the dues of a secured creditor. In Sundaresh Bhatt v. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, the Supreme Court had to deal with the position of the Customs Act 1962 (Customs Act) with respect to the IBC, since the Customs Act also created a first charge under its Section 142A. The court in this case ruled that the IBC overrides the Customs Act since it is a more recent statute. Similarly, in M/s Cholamandalam Investment v. the Principal Commissioner, the Madras High Court also refused to accept that the dues of the Income Tax Department can be equated to the dues of a secured creditor. More importantly, in Ghanashyam Mishra and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited, the Supreme Court had ruled that all kinds of government dues would fall under the category of operational debt and can be extinguished if they do not form a part of the approved resolution plan. Even the Viswanathan Committee Report on Bankruptcy Law categorically places any amount due to the Central or the State Government below the dues of secured creditors. Hence, there has been consistency in the position of the courts and the framers concerning the position of statutory dues under the IBC.\n\nDissecting the Ratio\n\nThe matter in Rainbow Papers concerned dues under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003 (GVAT). Section 48 of the GVAT states that tax dues payable to the government “shall be a first charge on the property of such dealer, or as the case maybe, such person.” The court held that Section 48 of GVAT creates a ‘security interest’ as defined under Section 3(31) of the IBC. Moreover, the court also held that the stipulated time period to file a claim under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 is not mandatory but discretionary in nature. Hence, a delay in filing claims could not be the sole reason for rejecting a claim. \n\nFinally, coming to the crux of the matter, the court opined that Section 48 of the GVAT is not inconsistent with Section 53 of the IBC or for that matter any other provision of the IBC. Hence under Section 53, the state dues would be treated as the equivalent of debts owed to secured creditors. In paragraph 57 of the judgment, the Supreme Court noted that a security interest can be created by the operation of law. The point that the court implicitly put forth is that there are two ways through which security interest can be created. First, as noted in Concast Steel And Power Limited v. Mstc Limited, security interests are ordinarily created by agreements and second, after Rainbow Papers, they can be created by a statute. The logic put forth by the court for this position was that the definition of ‘secured creditors’ under the IBC does not expressly prohibit a government body. What the court failed to account for was the fact that the definition of ‘security interest’ under Section 3(31) of the IBC talks about the right created by a transaction. ‘Transaction’ under Section 3(33) of the IBC is defined as an “agreement or arrangement in writing for the transfer of assets, or funds, goods or services, from or to the corporate debtor.” Hence, by the very nature of this definition, security interest would only include a right that is formed owing to a consensual agreement between any two parties. The definition does not provide any scope for a statutory created security interest at all. However, it is seen in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that all government dues are sometimes argued to be falling under the ratio of Rainbow Papers. The next section attempts to provide clarity regarding this confusion.\n\nClarification or Dilution?\n\nThe Supreme Court in Rainbow Papers has gone against the settled position of law. However, various recent National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) judgments such as Deputy Commissioner State Taxes and Excise v. Sh. Sanjay Gupta and Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise v. Naresh Kumar Sood, Liquidator have relied on the ratio of Rainbow Papers, to rule that government bodies having statutorily created first charges are to be treated as secured creditors under the IBC. This is a stark shift in jurisprudence from the earlier stance of courts where they ruled that IBC would override other statutes and not according government authorities the status of a secured creditor. In light of such a shift in the legal position of the treatment of statutory dues during the insolvency process, it becomes imperative to ascertain the exact scope of the new judgment.\n\nIn NRC Limited v. State of Maharashtra, the Bombay High Court stated that Rainbow Papers must be read in context. The approach was somewhat similar to the exercise that the Supreme Court had conducted in the review petition of the Vidarbha judgment where the court stated that a judgment cannot be read like a statute and must only be interpreted in the context of its facts and circumstances. According to the Bombay High Court, the two things that were considered by the judges in Rainbow Papers were first, the charge was created by a statute under the GVAT and second, the claim was put forth to the resolution professional before the resolution plan was approved by the committee of creditors under Section 30(4) of the IBC. Hence, it becomes very clear that the statute should explicitly state if it aims to designate a particular government body as a secured creditor while claiming its dues.\n\nThis interpretation was also endorsed by the Chandigarh Bench of the NCLT in the matter of Haryana through Excise and Taxation v. Anup Sood Resolution Professional. In this case, the bench opined that there would be no assumption that a charge by the nature of being statutory in nature would mean that it would be given a priority status. It would have to be argued by the governmental authority on the basis of the statute that it seeks to file its claim under. If the said authority is unable to do so, then the claim would be treated as an operational debt. There can also be another situation wherein the statute creates a first charge but still does not create the position of a secured creditor because of the way the provision has been framed. In Jet Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Welfare Association v. Ashish Chhawachharia, NCLAT Principal Bench, New Delhi was faced with a similar situation. The NCLAT noticed that Section 82 of the Maharashtra Goods and Services Tax Act 2017 while creating a first charge for the government authority created an exception for the IBC and hence the Rainbow Papers judgment would not be applicable in the said case.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Supreme Court has wandered away from the settled position. Many have argued that such a stance by the court defeats the whole purpose of the priority list under the IBC. Till the time the judgment is either reviewed or overruled, the ratio would essentially mean that the entire corporate insolvency resolution process would have to treat certain kinds of government dues as a priority. This article attempted to show that the judgment was not as grave as has been argued in courts and has been clarified if not diluted by subsequent judgments.\nSupreme CourtIBCInsolvencyRainbow Papers\nInsolvency Law\n724 views\n10 likes.

        "content": "Gaurav G. Arora, Aditi Richa Tiwari\nNov 10, 2022\n3 min read\nRegulating Algorithms through Data Protection Laws: Reigning the Unruly Horse\n[Gaurav and Aditi are lawyers at JSA. The following article was first published on Lexology.]\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly deepening its inroads to human civilization. If statistics are to be relied on, the global market share of AI is expected to rise from 87 billion US dollars in 2021 to 1,591 billion US dollars in 2030.\n\nThe employability of AI has become all-pervasive, owing to its undeniable benefits. However, serious threats to privacy can potentially emerge because of such increasing reliance on AI. These threats can stem from the foundation of AI, that is, algorithms.\n\nWhile algorithms are at the core of all AI-driven technologies, these form one of the most perceivable sources of threats to data protection and privacy. Algorithms, at times suffer from in-built biases and errors that distort operations, resulting in unintended or unwarranted outputs. At times, algorithms are ill-equipped to deal with external manipulations to data, thereby subjecting data to serious risks of unwarranted intrusion.\n\nUnderstanding the Global Data Protection Landscape Governing AI-Induced Risks to Data\n\nRisks to users’ data have been recognized by the data protection laws of major jurisdictions including European Union (EU). EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recognizes inter alia the risks of automated processing of data and aims to resolve the same through a data protection impact assessment (DPIA). The assessment evaluates the degree of risk that such automated processing poses to the “rights and freedoms of natural persons” and imposes additional compliances to be undertaken prior to processing.\n\nRecognizing the advancement in technology and consequently, the need to tighten the regulatory grip on AI, EU is on its way to materialize its proposal for a regulation laying down harmonized rules on AI. This proposal inter alia aims at identifying the data protection and privacy risks associated with the use of AI, thereby subjecting high risk data sets to appropriate data management and governance practices, complementing the GDPR. The necessity for an integrated regulatory mechanism concerning AI and algorithms has also been recognized through numerous resolutions adopted by EU, including its resolution on AI in a digital age.\n\nIn the United States, where data protection is governed by numerous data protection legislations framed to cater to different sectors, an integrated data protection law is yet to find its place. The proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act inter alia aims at regulating data privacy rights through various measures concerning algorithmic practices including algorithm impact assessment and algorithm design evaluation to prevent unwarranted algorithmic practices.\n\nAs another example, the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 explicitly recognizes the rights of users against unbridled data processing through AI, and bars solely automated decisions in certain conditions. United Kingdom’s Parliament is also in the process of materializing two bills – Data Protection and Digital Information Bill and Online Safety Bill. Both the bills aim at regulating automated decision making by standardizing practices concerning data processing in an effort to regulate algorithms.\n\nAs can be inferred from the regulatory canvas of major jurisdictions, data protection laws necessarily contain regulations aimed at protecting the rights of users against unwarranted outcomes of automated decision making and similar AI-induced risks. Such inclusion reassures the competence of data protection law as an instrument to regulate algorithms and AI.\n\nRegulation of AI in India\n\nMuch like India’s data protection regime, its regulations concerning AI-induced risks to data are yet to materialize. While there are numerous policy documents aimed at recognizing the necessity to regulate AI across multiple sectors in India, an integrated legislation addressing algorithm-induced risks to users’ data is absent.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 (2019 Bill), that has been recently withdrawn, recognized the rights of data principals (natural persons to whom the concerned data relates) against automated processing in a limited manner. It provided for an impact assessment in cases of significant risk of harm to data principals and provided data principals with the right to obtain information about the use of their data in the case of automated processing subject to certain exceptions. However, the Joint Parliamentary Committee through its recommendations in the form of Data Protection Bill 2021 added further exceptions to the rights of data principals concerning automated processing of data and restricted the already limited scope of the 2019 Bill.\n\nThe present status of uncertainty around regulation of AI and data protection in India calls for an integrated “comprehensive legal framework” including a redress to AI-induced risks to data.\nData ProtectionArtificial IntelligenceEUGDPR\nCommercial Law\n91 views\n1 like.

        "content": "Sidharrth Shankar, Nandini Seth, Shivani Singh\nNov 10, 2022\n3 min read\nExamining IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations\n[Sidharrth is a Partner at JSA. The following article has been jointly authored by him with Nandini and Shivani, lawyers at JSA. The article was first published on Lexology.]\n\nThe Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has issued the exposure draft of the IRDAI (Issuance of e-Insurance Policies) Regulations 2022 (IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations) for public comments. The key changes proposed by the draft IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations are as follows:\nAn electronic insurance account (eIA) (with a unique eIA number) is mandatory for every policyholder.\nAll policies issued to a policyholder are required to be held in the eIA of such policyholder.\nSubject to any exemptions that may be granted by IRDAI, every insurer is required to issue all insurance policies in electronic form (irrespective of whether the proposal is received in electronic form or otherwise).\nAn insurer is required to offer discount (in accordance with the guidelines issued by IRDAI) in the premium rates to the policyholder if the policy is purchased directly via the electronic platform.\nInsurers are required to provide all existing policyholders with the facility of an electronic insurance policy.\nAll existing policies are required to be issued to the insurance repositories (i.e., an entity that has been granted a certificate of registration by IRDAI for maintaining data of insurance policies in electronic form on behalf of the insurer) within 12 months from the effective date of the IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations, with the relevant policyholders being informed in accordance with the IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations.\nOver the last few years, IRDAI has been promoting dematerialization of insurance policies for ensuring quick retrieval of insurance policies and minimizing the risk of losing insurance policies held in physical form. The process of dematerialization of insurance policies is akin to the universal practice of holding securities in dematerialized form with the following key differences:\nWhereas individuals can use the demat account of their securities for trading securities, the insurance demat account acts only as a repository for storing insurance policies.\nWhereas individuals are permitted to open multiple demat accounts for trading securities (with different depositories and brokers), individuals can open only a single account with an insurance repository (which can then be ported from one insurance repository to another).\nIt is understood that IRDAI has issued these draft IRDAI e-Insurance Regulations after deliberations with relevant stakeholders, given that its initiative of dematerializing insurance policies in the past did not gain significant traction due to the costs involved and timing concerns. Accessibility to the internet, the extent of internet penetration, and the literacy rates in India are the key drivers of success of this digitalization drive. According to a report by IAMAI and Kantar, India has only 692,000,000 active internet users. Further, as of the year 2021 (based on the National Statistical Office’s data), India’s average literacy rate was 77.70%. Given that internet facilities are not yet available to more than half of India’s population and the literacy rate is not close to 100%, it is likely that, while the process of issuance of electronic insurance policies can commence, the compulsory issuance of such policies will need to be made subject to certain exemptions. IRDAI’s objective of boosting insurance penetration in India will need to be kept in mind while determining the exemptions as a large demographic of potential policyholders in India are at present in the rural areas.\n\nGiven the Government of India’s emphasis on digitalization, it is likely that, with the requisite exemptions, this proposal of IRDAI will be embraced by the stakeholders, particularly as it will lead to reduction in the paperwork and creation of a single portal for: (a) accessing policy documents (particularly necessary in the case of health and life insurance where the policyholder’s nominee may require immediate access); (b) raising claims; and (c) KYC verification. What remains to be seen is whether this digitalization initiative becomes a useful tool in penetrating the insurance market in India, and if the benefits of this initiative outweigh the logistical issues and costs involved.\nIRDAIInsurancee-Insurance\nCommercial Law\n142 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Resolving the Conundrum Around Buy-Now-Pay-Later",
        "content": "Aashna Shah, Priyanshi Jain\nNov 6, 2022\n5 min read\nResolving the Conundrum Around Buy-Now-Pay-Later\n[Aashna and Priyanshi are students at Institute of Law, Nirma University.]\n\nThe market for buy now pay later (BNPL) has gained a lot of traction; ranging from 569% in 2020 to 637% in 2021 year-on-year growth rates. In a BNPL transaction, the borrower is allowed to purchase products on a deferred payment basis and is required to pay the debt in predetermined instalments. \n\nIt has become increasingly popular amongst new to credit classes considering it involves scant or no assessment of the borrower’s credit worthiness. Additionally, borrowers can obtain hassle free credit without interest. These products are modelled as credit card challengers because of the ease that it provides to the customers. \n\nOn the contrary, the delinquency rates have also increased which can cause systematic financial risk. Consequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released a notification which bars all non-bank prepaid payment instrument issuers from loading prepaid payment instruments (PPI) through credit lines. Non-compliance of this notification shall lead to penal action under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007. This notification has adversely impacted the business models of fintech companies such as Slice that load PPIs through credit lines.\n\nIn this article, the authors intend to explore the regulatory framework for BNPL and analyse the plausible reasons for imposing a ban on loading of PPIs through credit lines.\n\nRBI’s Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments 2021\n\nThe Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments issued by the RBI permits co-branding between banks and non-banks with the PPI issuers. As a result of this co-branding arrangement, the banks carry the function of PPI issuer and the fintechs usually cater to the marketing and distribution of the PPIs. The banks and non-banks must mandatorily take the authorization from RBI before issuing the PPIs. \n\nThe guidelines mandate that banks and non-banks were to load or reload the PPI through cash, debit or credit cards, debit to bank accounts. That said, the question which remained unvoiced was whether the fintech companies were allowed to load PPIs through credit lines or not. However, the recent clarification issued by the RBI makes it amply clear that non-bank entities are not allowed to fund PPIs through credit lines. \n\nThe fundamental concern of the RBI was that PPIs were following the trail of shadow credit cards. The repayment schedules, interest rates and many other terms were similar to credit card, but PPIs did not follow the regulatory regime governing those cards. The lack of fair practices concerning minimum amounts due, weak customer grievance redressal mechanism coupled with inadequate measures to govern fraudulent transactions were the factors about which the regulator raised concerns.   \n\nIn light of these, the fate of BNPL may be riddled with ambiguity. On the one hand, the RBI has restricted the entry for authorized non-banks through credit lines and while on the other, it is silent on the aspect of authorized bank entities. Therefore, amidst all these things, how the clarification will unfold for BNPL is yet to be seen.   \n\nDecoding RBI’s Report of the Working Group on Digital Lending\n\nThe RBI constituted a working group to restrain digital lending activities by entities outside the regulatory ambit. The report classified fintech entities which provide BNPL products as lending service providers, whose main service is to provide a marketplace for lenders and borrowers. Due to the rise of innovation in the fintech market, these entities also offer various ancillary services such as sourcing of loans to underwriting risk.\n\nThe report suggested that a definition of ‘credit’ should be introduced. This will help resolve the ambiguity regarding the classification of BNPL as a lending activity. Put simply, BNPL can be considered a form of credit because the borrower is permitted to pay later and incur debt. However, BNPL transactions do not involve levying of interest, and therefore, do not fulfil the essentials of credit.  \n\nDefining credit will enable credit information companies (CIC) to report BNPL transactions. In the press release by RBI, it is stated that regulated entities which extend loans through fintechs are required to report all deferred payment products to CIC. Earlier, BNPL players used to employ unconventional methods to determine the credit worthiness of customers. They use AI and machine learning tools to track the customer’s payment history on various e-commerce websites, utility bill payments, etc. Thus, reporting BNPL transactions will help ascertain the credit worthiness of borrowers whose credit histories are unknown as they do not qualify for the traditional credit facilities. It shall also increase transparency and reduce the delinquency rates of such transactions as BNPL players can weed out defaulters. \n\nThough, if borrowers’ default on small ticket loans, sharing of such information may force them to resort to unorganized lending. Hence, in alignment with the RBI’s objective to prohibit predatory lending, the authors suggest that the regulator release guidelines specifying all information which should be shared with CIC and the methods for credit assessment. \n\nThe report also suggested that risk participation by fintechs in the form of first loss default guarantees (FLDG) should be prohibited. Fintech entities enter into synthetic structures with the banks/NBFCs (rent-an-NBFC-model), where they undertake to compensate the lender if the borrower defaults on repayment. These entities enter into indemnity agreements to demonstrate their underwriting capabilities and have skin in the game. This is beneficial for loan originators because it would ensure that the borrower quality is not diluted. \n\nSince these underwriting activities do not meet the principal business criteria to be regulated by the RBI, they do not need to maintain regulatory capital. Unregulated entities take exposure in their balance sheets and report it on a deferred payment basis. Therefore, undercapitalized entities bear the credit risk, which is a form of regulatory arbitrage. \n\nThis recommendation is still under consideration. For the time being, all FLDG business models need to comply with the RBI’s Master Direction on Securitisation of Standard Assets (MD-SSA) norms. However, the implementation of RBI’s MD-SSA directions is still unclear and requires specific clarification. The authors opine that a blanket ban on FLDGs can be detrimental to the digital lending ecosystem. FLDGs promote lending and add to the credibility of the fintech risk evaluation. \n\nAnother concern while deciding on the legality of FLDG would be financial inclusivity. BNPL products provide support to the excluded classes; they help to narrow the credit gap amongst classes. Therefore, the regulator should ensure that the policy changes are aligned with the goal to democratize credit. \n\nThe regulator has also prescribed a minimum cooling-off period, which has to be adopted by the banks and non-bank entities. The said rules will be applicable to the borrower and will provide a time to exit the digital loan by paying the principal amount coupled with that of the interest. For loans having a tenor of fewer than seven days, at least a day cooling off period will be provided and for other loans, at least three days' cooling off period will be provided.  \n\nAuthors’ Take\n\nFintechs require a fine-tuned balance between fostering growth and managing the risks. The recent move by the RBI is not overtly dictatory in nature if we see the trends across the globe. The fintech market is booming, which justifies the need for greater regulatory supervision. RBI’s concern, if implemented vigorously, might force all BNPLs to revamp their business models. For instance, Slice has already begun the bandwagon. However, RBI has seen the growth of this fintech and its recent declaration of Payment Visions 2025 also seems to be promising. Hence, RBI, though pushing toward traditional regulation, does not aim to ignore the potential space of fintech. \nBNPLRBINBFCBanking\nCorporate Law\n•\nCommercial Law\n460 views\n8 likes.

        "content": "Muhammed Ijaz\nNov 6, 2022\n6 min read\nAll is Well, Except 'Control': A Critical Review of ‘Revamped’ Overseas Investment Framework\n[Muhammed is a student at Faculty of Law, University of Delhi.]\n\nGiven the evolving entrepreneurship surge in India and the increasingly integrated global business market, Indian entrepreneurs have been vocal about restructuring the existing outbound investment legal and regulatory framework. Upholding the need for liberalization, the Central Government and the Reserve Bank of India have recently undertaken a comprehensive exercise to revamp the existing regulatory framework of overseas investment and have formulated a revamped overseas investment framework (Revamped/New Framework) comprising the FEMA (Overseas Investment) Rules 2022 (OI Rules) notified by the Central Government and FEMA (Overseas Investment) Regulations 2022 (OI Regulation) notified by the Reserve Bank and the FEMA (Overseas Investment) Directions 2022 (OI Directions).\n\nThe framework regulating overseas investments from India was earlier governed by the FEMA (Transfer or Issue of any Foreign Security) Regulations 2004 and the FEMA (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property outside India) Regulations 2015, which have now been subsumed by the OI Rules, OI Regulations and the OI Directions that supersedes 53 erstwhile directions or circulars issued to operate the previous outbound investment framework. \n\nWhile the OI Rules propose to deal with the investment in non-debt instruments and acquisition and transfer of immovable property outside India and regulatory aspects of the framework including the conditions and permissions for making an overseas investment, restrictions from making Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), etc., the OI Regulations deal with investments by way of debt instruments, such as guarantee, pledge, charge, etc. and cover aspects such as the conditions for undertaking financial commitment, investment in debt instruments, consideration in case of acquisition or transfer of equity capital of a foreign entity, mode of payment, and reporting requirements. The OI Directions provide for guidance on the interpretation of the OI Rules and and the OI Regulations, and operational instructions to the AD banks. They also provide for certain compliance requirements from the erstwhile ODI master directions, not covered in the OI Rules or the OI Regulations.\n\nSome of the significant changes brought about through the new rules and regulations are:\n\nClarity with respect to various definitions such as ‘foreign entity’, ‘overseas portfolio investment’ (OPI), etc.;\nIntroduction of the concept of 'strategic sector';\nDispensation with the approval requirement for deferred payment of consideration; \nPermission in respect of ODI by Indian entities in non-financial sector, in startups and IFSC; and\nIntroduction of the concept of 'late submission fee' for delayed reporting.\nIn view of the above significant changes, it would not be an understatement that the New Framework is an exercise of rational overhaul. However, a critical reading on the same Revamped Framework also points out certain ambiguities, including those pertaining to the definition of 'control', ‘layers’ and 'step down subsidiaries' (SDS) vis-a-vis 'round tripping' provision, which are discussed in detail below.\n\nControl\n\nUnlike the previous framework, the New Framework introduced ‘control’ as a key term by specifically defining it under the OI Rules (Rule 2 (1)(c)) as a right which enables one to appoint majority of the directors or to control management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders’ agreements or voting agreements that entitle them to 10% or more of the voting rights or in any other manner in the entity. Precisely, the term control has been defined as a ‘threshold’, upon the trigger of which necessary compliance as per the OI Rules and the OI Regulations is to be met with.\n\nThe concept of ‘control’ has already been prevalent through various existing Indian laws and regulations, namely, the Companies Act 2013 (Section 2(27)), the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011 (Regulation 2(1)(e)), and the FDI policy of 2020 (definition 2.1.8).\n\nComing to the New Framework, in addition to the prevalent definition of 'control' incorporated in the statutes and the regulations discussed above, the definition as per the New Framework also includes the exercise of control by virtue of voting rights with a 10% threshold, meaning thereby that if a voting rights' agreement entitles 10% or more, it will still be ‘control’. The 10% threshold may have been introduced to demarcate a clear boundary between ODI and OPI in the New Framework.\n\nOne Framework - Multiple Interpretations\n\nHowever, the ambiguity pertaining to the term ‘control’ incorporated in the New Framework arises when it is read with the note provided under Para 20 of the OI Directions which deals with restrictions and prohibition on layers of subsidiaries. The mentioned note provides that a foreign entity will be said to have ‘control’ if it holds a stake of 10% or more in an entity. This implies that a mere stake of 10% or more in an entity will also be deemed as a ‘control’ which is certainly capable to subsume the 10% voting rights' threshold which has been provided in the OI Regulations.\n\nA combined reading of the definition ‘control’ as set out in the regulations and the note provided in the OI Directions is not providing a clear picture, and the question whether 10% voting rights coupled with rights to appoint a majority of directors/take key policy decisions has to be considered or a minority stake of only 10% will trigger control, remains unanswered.\n\nA significant implication of this ambiguous definition of control is that this would cause Indian entities to ascertain if there are investments by foreign entities that cause them to hold 10% or more of voting rights resulting in the establishment of control during the course of foreign outbound investment transactions. Also, as raised previously, if a mere 10% of stake holding other than the prescribed 10% voting rights threshold will still be construed as control, it will result in recurrent ascertainment of control in numerous investment transactions held by entities in their subsidiaries/SDS leading to a complex compliance and reporting burden. \n\n‘Round Tripping’ - Unclear ‘Layers’\n\nRound tripping is commonly construed as a combination of transactions involving the transfer of money across jurisdictions, eventually resulting in a return to the jurisdictions of origin. Typically, such transactions are not bona fide and are used for tax evasion or money laundering.\n\nUntil the Revamped Framework, there has been no conclusive provision which categorically dealt with provisions related to round tripping except in 2019 when RBI responded through an FAQ (later updated in the master directions) that the Indian party is not permitted to set up a step down subsidiary/joint venture in India through its foreign entity  (wholly owned subsidiary /joint venture) directly or indirectly through step down subsidiary of the foreign entity.\n\nAdvancing beyond mere insertion in the FAQs, the New Framework effectively dealt with the provision relating to round tripping under the OI Rules [Rule 17(3)] which provide that an Indian entity can invest in a foreign company having/ (intending to) establish a subsidiary in India subject to: \n\n(a) the overall structure not resulting in more than 2 layers of subsidiaries; and \n(b) the foreign entity being engaged in a bona fide business activity.\n\nAlthough the new framework has relaxed the restrictions pertaining to round tripping by allowing investment in entities up to 2 layers of subsidies/SDS, it is still not entirely clear whether the ‘two layers of subsidiaries’ need to be considered from the perspective of Indian party or the foreign entity (more precisely, if this prohibition on multi-layered structures is intended to cover only investments which result in round tripping into India or even those multi-layered structures which are entirely outside India).\n\nFurther, the identification of subsidiaries is quintessential in establishing round tripping, the question of the threshold for determining subsidiaries is still unclear within the new framework. As per Section 2(87) of the Companies Act 2013, the threshold is provided as 50% for determining a subsidiary, whereas for that of a foreign entity, a mere 10% stake would suffice as per the New Framework.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the fact that the Revamped Framework offers simplification and clarity in terms of concepts and provisions as that of the erstwhile framework , the ambiguities pertaining to ‘control’ and clarity upon ‘layers’ of subsidiaries with respect to restrictions on structure of investment needs to be resolved for the following reasons: \n\nAs per the new framework, once control is established, the entity over which the foreign entity exercises the control will be regarded as a subsidiary of the foreign entity or an SDS. Resultantly, the structure of the subsidiary/ SDS will be required to comply with the structural requirements of a foreign entity as provided in the framework. \nAdditionally, the revamped framework, which prescribes detailed reporting requirements applicable to the Indian entity acquiring control through the foreign entity, has ambiguities in relation to establishing control and layers of Indian entities which would result in recurring and humongous reporting and compliance burden.\nIn view of the above discussions, it can be concluded that the revised regulatory framework is undoubtedly a rational move and certainly capable of easing doing of overseas businesses for Indian entities, but the above-cited ambiguities must be resolved with immediate intervention from RBI by way of an amendment or clarity note. Else, the ambiguities are capable enough to derail the key objectives of this new regime by being an “Achilles heel” inflicting relentless confusion and complex legal compliances for Indian corporations engaged or aspiring for outbound investments and business.\nODIOPIInvestmentControlRBISEBI\nCorporate Law\n433 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Delhi High Court on Specific Performance of Determinable Contracts",
        "content": "Sanya Goel\nNov 5, 2022\n6 min read\nDelhi High Court on Specific Performance of Determinable Contracts\n[Sanya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nOn 23 August 2022, the Delhi High Court passed its judgement in Royal Orchids v. Kulbir Singh Kohli and Another holding that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in a commercial transaction between private parties is determinable by nature. Therefore, the court held that such a contract can be terminated in the absence of a termination clause. Alongside, it was held by the Single Judge Bench of Justice Mini Pushkarna that the party was not entitled to any interim relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (A&C Act) since the MOU was not subject to specific performance owing to the statutory bar in Section 14(d) of the Specific Relief Act 1963 (SRA). This judgement provides for settlement of significant questions of the law pertaining to the perception of determinability in India along with eligibility for specific performance and termination in the absence of a termination clause. \n\nIn this post, the author seeks to analyze the judgement of the Delhi High Court in this case and examine the duality in perceiving determinability of contracts in India. Finally, this post seeks to clarify the standing of the courts in the present context. \n\nFactual Background\n\nThe respondents are co-owners of the land who signed an MOU with the petitioner, Royal Orchids, wanting to engage with a reputable builder for their services whereby the latter agreed to undertake development of the aforementioned land. The MOU stated that to repay the loan taken by the respondents from Yes Bank against the security of the said property, the petitioner will initially pay INR 1,00,00,000 to the respondents out of the payable amount of INR 4,02,91,247.61. The petitioner used the arbitration clause following the MOU's termination by the respondents. The petitioner asked the Delhi High Court to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendants from sale, alienation, or establishment of any third-party interest in the subject land in a request for interim relief under Section 9 of the A&C Act.\n\nRoyal Orchids, the petitioner, argued in front of the court that it was entitled to an award ordering the said MOU's specific performance as well as an award ordering the defendants to fully uphold their MOU obligations. The petitioner continued by contending that the contract was not terminable at the respondents' discretion because the parties intended to grant the petitioner proprietary rights over the aforementioned real estate and that there was no clause in the contract that gave the respondents the right to do so. In order for the respondents to be able to pay off their loan, the respondent claimed that the petitioner had to deposit specific sums of money by the deadline laid out in the MOU. The respondent argued that the petitioner's failure to make the required payments constituted a serious breach of the MOU's terms by the petitioner. Therefore, he argued that the respondents had the right to terminate the agreement because time was of the essence and the petitioner had failed to fulfil its duties in accordance with the timelines stated in the MOU. It was further asserted by the respondent that the MOU was in the nature of a private commercial transaction because it involved a construction and renovation contract between two private parties. As a result, the MOU could be terminated at any time without providing reasoning for the same and even in the absence of a clause explicitly allowing either party to do so, the respondent argued.\n\nIssue\n\nThe issue before the High Court of Delhi was whether an MOU of determinable nature is entitled to specific performance under Section 16 of the SRA and/or can be terminated in the absence of a termination clause. \n\nRuling\n\nExamining the MOU's terms, the High Court found that the respondents still held the entirety of the property's rights, including the right to sell it and the right to possess it, and that the petitioner's possession was only nominal for the purpose of developing the aforementioned property. The court noted that the mentioned MOU was solely a construction contract, pursuant to which the petitioner was not to obtain any ownership rights, and that the Supreme Court in Sushil Kumar Agarwal v. Meenakshi Sadhu and Others had made a similar observation and had ruled that courts typically do not order specific performance of a construction or repair contract. The court found that because time was of the essence in the parties' agreement, the petitioner was required to complete the payment within the allotted period. It held that the petitioner was guilty of failing to pay the necessary amounts within the time frame provided in the MOU. The Bench further stated that pursuant to Section 16(c) of the SRA, a person who fails to establish that he has performed, or that he has consistently been prepared and willing to perform, the material terms of the contract, which were required of him, will not be entitled to specific performance of the contract. \n\nThe court ruled that the MOU signed by the two private parties was a construction and re-development contract, that was within the nature of a private commercial transaction, rejecting the petitioner's argument that it was not a determinable contract. As a result, the court determined that the MOU was determinable by its very character, even though it did not incorporate a termination clause. As a result of the statutory bar in Section 14(d) of the SRA, the court ruled that the MOU could not be specifically performed. As a result, the petitioner was not eligible for any interim relief under Section 9 of the A&C Act because the petitioner was statutorily barred from requesting specific performance of the MOU. Thus, the petition was dismissed by the court.\n\nIndia’s Binary Perception of Determinability\n\nContracts that are intrinsically determinable cannot be specifically performed under the SRA. However, neither the SRA nor the Indian Contract Act 1872, the two main statutes governing contractual dealings in India, provides any clarification on what precisely qualifies as determinability. \n\nThe Delhi High Court in Turnaround Logistics Limited v. Jet Airways Limited and Others stated that “determinable’ […] means a contract which can be put to an end.” Here, a contract's determinability is based solely on the idea of whether it can be terminated. To be fair, this comprehension seems excessively vague. Given that most contracts, if not all, can be terminated and that determinable contracts cannot be specifically enforced (Section 14, SRA), the court’s perception substantially impedes the enforcement of a majority of contracts and consequently, the convenience of conducting business in the Indian capital. Although the High Court in Madras shared a problematic viewpoint, later interpretation has been more attuned to commercial complexity. The court narrowed the definition of determinability in 2020, finding that only contracts that can be unilaterally terminated by parties, whether at will or without reason, are determinable. \n\nIn TO Abraham v. Jose Thomas, the Kerala High Court used a similar constrictive approach, finding that the absence of a showing of grounds for termination was what made a contract determinable. The court ruled that in order for a contract to be determinable, it had to be proven that either party might terminate it without giving a cause. Accordingly, a contract that can be terminated upon the incidence of an eventuality (such as insolvency or a breach of terms) would be determinable under common law, but not under the SRA; for that, it has to be terminable at will, not mandating an explanation to the opposite party. This conundrum is barely resolved by decisions made by the Bombay High Court. The simple fact that a contract had termination clauses was enough for the court to rule it as determinable which is quite contrary to the case in hand where the contract was considered determinable despite the absence of a termination clause. \n\nTherefore, we identify two main conceptions of determinability under the SRA. One is the broad interpretation favoured in Delhi, which prevents specific performance under any terminable agreement, and the other is its commercially oriented subset, which is supported in Kerala and has lately gained support in Madras and Bombay. According to this subset, only contracts that can be terminated at any time cannot be specifically enforced.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn consideration of this, although a contract’s termination is not explicitly stated or when the obligations under an agreement seem to last forever, \"forever\" may actually turn out to be a very little time given that either party may end the contract at any point by providing the other party reasonable notice for any reason or no reason at all. It is simple to integrate this observation into India's binary interpretation of determinability. Contracts without termination clauses would be ‘inherently determinable’ under the SRA in light of their ability to be terminated at any time, taking into account the Delhi High Court's approach in context of the present case along with Delhi's previously inclusive approach and Kerala's restrictive approach. In India, therefore, specific performance of ad infinitum contracts is not possible. The only option for relief would be to file a claim for damages; an injunction would not be provided.\nArbitrationSpecific ReliefDeterminableContracts\nDispute Resolution\n1,301 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Is SSE a Competent Mechanism to Meet CSR Mandates?",
        "content": "Shaurya Singh\nNov 2, 2022\n5 min read\nIs SSE a Competent Mechanism to Meet CSR Mandates?\n[Shaurya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had recently laid out the framework for a Social Stock Exchange (SSE). By creating a platform that allows purchasing such securities, SEBI aims to provide nationwide accessibility of philanthropic funds to social enterprises (SEs). However, despite making changes to some existing regulations such as the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018, the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015, and the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 to facilitate the functioning of such an exchange, there are certain laws expressly dealing with corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandates that have been left untouched. Although this article recognises the need for bringing the reforms in the current regulations and thereby validating holdings in SSE to fulfil CSR mandates (as suggested by the expert working group of SEBI), it also points out the shortcomings of the proposed reforms. It discusses why mere purchasing securities should not amount to fulfilment of the entire obligation or even a larger proportion of the obligation, which could be implied from the reading of the said proposal.\n\nPlacing SSE in Existing CSR and Taxation Laws \n\nThe concept of an SSE was initially introduced by the Finance Minister during the budget of 2019-20. Later, in July 2022, SEBI released a framework for the SSE that would allow trading in securities of social enterprises, which can be listed here, including both non-profit organisations (NPOs) and for-profit enterprises which have ‘social intent and impact’ as their primary goals. The SEBI also introduced several types of securities which can be issued by the SEs, mainly:\n\n●       zero coupon zero principal bonds (ZCZP)\n●       equity or debt securities issued by Section 8 companies \n●       social impact funds (currently known as social venture funds)\n●       development impact bonds (DIBs)\n●       mutual funds \n\nZCZPs and DIBs are 2 key securities that are proposed to be allowed for meeting CSR obligations by the expert working group headed by Ishaat Hussain. As per Section 2(11) of the Companies Act 2013, NPOs do not fall under the category of ‘body corporates’ and face restrictions on issuing securities backed by equity or debt. The ZCZP, however, would be a purchasable instrument that could be issued by NPOs which would not give financial returns but social returns by promoting welfare in the society (including by way of eradication of hunger, poverty, malnutrition and inequality, or promotion of sustainable development goals / priority areas identified by Niti Aayog). On the other hand, the fundamental concept behind a DIB is that an NPO would receive funds after it delivers on some pre-agreed social metrics at pre-set costs/rates. \n\nThe working group was of the view that funding NPOs via SSE should be considered valid to meet CSR obligations under Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013. The implied rationale here is that as all listings on SSE would be subjected to a proper and equitable reporting standard, they should be considered equivalent to the entities mentioned under Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules 2014. Further, it was proposed that “CSR funds should also be considered to act as outcome funder in case development impact bond. In this regard, there shall be a need to permit parking CSR capital in an escrow account for a period of three years. CSR capital, acting as an outcome funder, should also be permitted to grant to NPOs in DIB structure as an ‘accelerator grant’ –- a grant to fund non- program expenditure subject to 10% of the program cost”. Additionally, the provision of tax benefits under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961 and the exemption to philanthropic investors from securities transaction tax for trades made on the SSE, and capital gains tax on long  term capital gains accruing from sale of securities in the SSE were advised by the working group along with several other benefits such as allowing retail investors to avail a 100% tax exemption on their investments in the SSE MF structure, subject to an overall limit of INR 1,00,000.\n\nThese are reasonable recommendations as they would encourage corporates entities, institutions and retail investors to invest in such instruments. However, while making these suggestions, the working group ignored certain key fundamental factors which might even throw away the idea behind bringing in the CSR mandates.\n\nConsiderations not Considered by the Working Group \n\nThe reforms, as advised by the working group, have remained silent on what proportion of the total CSR funds could be contributed towards these securities. Ignorance of this aspect is actually way more concerning than it seems initially. \n\nA sizeable proportion of the funding these social enterprises receive is in the form of CSR funding by the corporate entities. Further, although there are around 2 million social enterprises in India, it is practically impossible to have even 10% of them listed, especially considering the regulatory obligations prescribed in the framework (released on 19 September 2022) and by the technical group such as construction of remuneration policies and stakeholder redressal mechanisms, maintenance and disclosure of balance sheet (in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013), program-wise fund utilization for the year along with auditor’s report which SEs are bound to follow in order to issue securities. Thus, if the entire obligation can be fulfilled by the mere purchase of securities listed on the exchange, this situation would result in millions of organisations struggling to find funds for their social initiatives, deterring the running or establishment of such organisations as it would be unsustainable. Moreover, because SSE would only comprise those SEs which would meet its regulatory and disclosure requirements, companies might consider maximizing their holdings in SSE, factoring in the higher transparency and accountability.\n\nThe strict reporting standards would demand serious alternation in operating standards and functioning in general, which would be a strenuous task for relatively smaller organisations. Even though these changes aim for a positive outlook by promoting transparent and disclosure driven operation among SEs, they would come at a literal cost that would be hard to bear. Hence, it would further aggravate the issues for smaller SEs since companies would rather consider funding a project which is backed by securities listed on SSE than fund a smaller less renowned local enterprise. Hence, on one hand, companies would fulfil their social responsibilities by making use of a rather straightforward and simplified system, but on the other hand, most of the SEs around the country would fail to do so due to losing access to existing funds and resources. \n\nValidating SSE to meet CSR requirements and availing tax benefits is indeed a much-needed reform that would incentivize investments in the SSE, and is one of the best ways to deploy unused CSR funds, but the silence on how much of the total funds could be allotted here is concerning. There must a be limit/cap on such investments and a specified percentage of the total fund which could be deployed in SSE. For instance, Canada’s social stock exchange, Social Venture Connexion (SVX) had limited the maximum amount that an (retail, institutional, or accredited) investor could invest in the SVX. The absence of such capping in the Indian SSE could lead to concerns regarding investor protection as well. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe proposal made by the working group would no doubt streamline the process of meeting CSR obligations, but a need for limitation/capping of these contributions is evident, or else SSE would be the path of deviation from the core ideals which fuel corporate social responsibility. Buying securities off an exchange to meet obligations would basically transform CSR obligation into just another regulatory formality for the companies. This would have a drastic impact on the existing social enterprises, as they would face a severe shortage of resources and would concentrate the resources in hands of a few, monopolizing the ‘social initiative’.\n\nThe recommendations made by the working group seem to be ‘corporate centric’ as they fail to account for the fundamental reality of the SEs and remain focused only towards simplifying the process of meeting CSR mandates and availing tax benefits. Therefore, there is a substantial need to look at these shortcomings of the proposed reform and fix its flaws before the SSE really comes to life.\nCompanies ActLODRCSRSocial Stock Exchange\nCorporate Law\n474 views\n23 likes.

        "title": "Analyzing SEBI Consultation Paper on Execution-Only Platforms in Direct Plans of Mutual Funds",
        "content": "Anoushka Chauhan, Rishabh Warrier\nOct 26, 2022\n6 min read\nAnalyzing SEBI Consultation Paper on Execution-Only Platforms in Direct Plans of Mutual Funds\n[Anoushka and Rishabh are students at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.]\n\nRecently, SEBI released a consultation paper proposing a framework for direct mutual fund (MF) investments through execution-only platforms (EOPs) offered by investment advisors (IAs) and stock brokers (SBs). \n\nMF investments can be routed either through an intermediary, or in the form of direct investment without availing the advisory or brokerage services of IAs and SBs. Investors often prefer the latter to save the commission otherwise paid to intermediaries, which instead gets added to their investment returns. \n\nInitially, when the prospect of providing direct plan through EOPs came to the forefront, firms required access to data feeds of registrar and transfer agents (RTAs), to access payment and transaction status’, maturity status and other information, and showcase them to the client to facilitate direct investments. These data feeds could be accessed only using a firm’s IA or SB code—this pre-condition mandated registration as either an IA, or a broker. Operational hurdles and compliances mandated of an IA made it more optimum for a firm to register itself as a broker, as shown by PayTM Money foregoing its IA registration in favour of becoming a broker. \n\nNow, SEBI undertook various initiatives to promote MF investments, including allowing IAs to employ technological platforms for MF transactions. Accordingly, IAs and SBs would employ the use of digital and technological platforms for investors to simply “execute” these transactions, without availing the advisory or brokerage services provided by them. As per SEBI, several problems followed. First, entities would obtain registration as IAs only to provide execution services, and not advisory services. Second, IAs and SBs would use their registration codes to have “visibility of data feeds of [their] clients.” A key concern emerging from this was that clients (more like “non-clients”) opting only for execution-only services on EOPs, would not get benefit of the investor protection mechanisms in place for regular clients. \n\nThis paper seeks to analyze the consultation paper and the proposed regulatory framework, with a view to balance investor protection with ease of making direct investments. \n\nWhy Regulate?\n\nSEBI has proposed that EOPs need to be regulated separately from IAs and SBs. SEBI proposes three possible ways to achieve the purpose: first, either by registering them as an intermediary that acts as the investor’s agent, governed by a separate regulatory framework; second, by registering them with the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) as an agent of the authority; third, by granting them limited membership with stock exchanges. \n\nA key concern that SEBI rightly pointed out was that the investors availing the execution services to the exclusion of the advisory/brokerage services would not qualify as ‘clients.’ This is because EOPs do not satisfy the definitional criteria of “investment adviser” in Regulation 2(m) of the Investment Adviser Regulations, or of a “stock broker” in Regulation 2(gb) of the Stock Broker Regulations. Since these investors are not availing the services that IAs and SBs are meant to provide, and since EOPs are not covered under the aforesaid regulations (or the SEBI Intermediary Regulations), the investors availing these execution-only services have no legal recourse under any of the regulatory frameworks of IAs or SBs.  \n\nAnother problem faced by current EOP platforms like PayTM or Zerodha, is the lack of a sustainable business model. Currently, EOPs do not charge any money from investors for providing their execution-only platforms. The current EOP revenue model, then, is based on the possibility of cross-selling other products to customers within the same platform. Following one of the three approaches laid down in the consultation paper would lead to a constant source of income, which will allow firms to function independently as an EOP. \n\nTherefore, the need to iron out conflict of interest and competency issues warrants even EOPs to have an underlying regulatory framework. \n\nRecommendations and Analysis\n\nThis leads us to the question of which of SEBI’s approaches would efficiently balance investor protection and easier access to MF investments. In the authors’ opinion, the second approach would be relatively more suitable, wherein an EOP would be the agent of the AMC. \n\nThe first or the third approach might impose a greater monetary burden on the investor themselves. The latter was visible when Zerodha charged INR 50 from the investor for using their platform, and the subsequent roll-back owing to a decrease in their user base. In any event, the premise of direct plan services is that investors spend less than they do with regular plan services. The only functionality of EOPs is providing customers with the underlying technological platform (and not any advice). Therefore, it making EOPs agents of the investor is not ideal, with the latter being forced to pay EOPs. Furthermore, EOPs would rake in higher profits in the second model by receiving commissions from AMCs for using their technological platform. \n\nNonetheless, the second approach poses two-fold practical difficulties: first, AMCs may be unwilling to spend money funding EOP platforms; and second, linking EOP profit to commissions received from AMCs can lead to manipulation. \n\nAs for the first point, the MF industry in July 2022 started providing financial services through the RTA backed “MF Central Private Limited”. Two possible scenarios emerge herein—with the SEBI MF EOP framework to include regulation of platforms such as MF central and MF utilities; and a scenario where this does not happen. A 2021 SEBI circular compelled RTAs, along with the MF industry, to form an interoperable platform to facilitate investment in MFs. The platform (MF Central) is supposed to comply with the SEBI Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience framework and the Guidelines for Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery. However, the proposed SEBI framework is unclear on whether it will also regulate platforms such as MF Central, and others of its kind already in existence. Excluding it from the ambit of the EOP framework might result in arbitrage, consequently hampering the efficiency of EOPs. It would, thus, be advisable to include such platforms within the ambit of the EOP framework. \n\nThe subsequent problem, however, is that AMCs have no reason to invest in the functioning of EOPs such as PayTM, when there already exists the AMFI-sponsored MF utilities platform and previously mentioned MF Central platform. The second approach, from the perspective of the AMCs, does not make sense. \n\nFor the second point, while it is clear that EOPs currently do not charge investors to access their platforms, they can still be remunerated by AMCs. Linking EOP remuneration to commissions by AMCs might lead to a bidding system for more visibility. Similar to how the Google AdWords program functions, AMCs with a larger corpus would have more visibility, restricting the competitiveness of the MF industry. While admitting that the premise of the EOP system is to attract investors who believe they are capable of investing without advice, a “top funds” category does affect the subconscious of the average investor. This can be resolved by adopting a fixed fee-model, thereby preventing linkage of visibility with commissions. Another concern raised was that the display of “top funds” might be construed to be “advice”. It is of the opinion of the authors that the aforementioned delinking and fixed pay model would solve the possibility of EOPs being brought under the regulatory framework of IAs. \n\nTherefore, while from an EOP perspective, the second approach seems ideal, SEBI would have to think outside the box to prevent linking visibility of funds with commissions paid and also provide some incentive for AMCs to get behind platforms such as PayTM Money and Zerodha Coin.  \n\nWith respect to the possibility of providing both financial and non-financial services, SEBI has already allowed MF Central to do the same. EOPs providing both the services would make it easier on the investors, who had to contact the RTAs of all AMCs individually, if there was a need for changing something as simple as an email address. Therefore, there prima facie seems to be no reason to deny EOPs (and investors) these pre-existing benefits. \n\nAdditionally, while data-sharing between different departments was appropriate for EOPs’ sustenance, before such a proposed framework, through cross-selling of products, the authors argue that in any of the 3 approaches, it is essential to keep investment data confidential.  Hence, criteria such as client segregation, and the need for robust cyber-security systems, need no debate—this is essential to the smooth and conflict-free functioning of EOPs. \n\nLastly, the consultation paper sought suggestions on whether any other minimum qualifications are required of promoters or key managerial personnel (KMPs). The essence of this requirement for intermediaries was to ensure that “advice” cannot be rendered by non-qualified persons—in line with the investor protection mandate of SEBI. However, EOPs have their foundation in the technological platform they provide. To that effect, SEBI’s proposed approaches stipulate basic infrastructural mandates. There seems to be no further need to have qualification requirements for promoters of KMPs in this field.\n\nConclusion\n\nSEBI is trying to fill a gap in the regulatory framework, in line with its mandate of investor protection. It has rightly identified the need for aspects such as segregation at the AMC level, and the need for robust cyber-security mechanisms / data-sharing policies. However, all of SEBI’s proposed approaches suffer from certain deficiencies. Addressing these is key, as the model chosen by SEBI would not only delineate EOPs relationship with the investor, but also affect their business model. Lastly, in case SEBI choses the second approach, it needs to ensure that commissions do not lead to visibility only for bigger AMCs.\nSEBI ActSEBIConsultation PaperMutual FundsExecution-Only Platforms\nCorporate Law\n219 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Social Media and Financial Markets: SEBI’s Welcome Move?",
        "content": "Shubhankar Tiwari, Dhaval Hemesh Sheth\nOct 22, 2022\n6 min read\nSocial Media and Financial Markets: SEBI’s Welcome Move?\n[Shubhankar and Dhaval are students at National Law University, Delhi.]\n\nThe increasing influence of social media platforms on financial markets brings its fair share of pros and cons. On one hand, information sharing and the creation of discourse through these platforms regarding the financial markets significantly contribute towards increasing transparency in the market. However, on the other hand, one cannot disregard the fact that social media has also been a notorious tool in manipulating human behaviour and acting as a vehicle of disinformation. \n\nIn order to curb such instances of market manipulation and the spread of disinformation, in January 2022, certain amendments were made to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations 2003 (PFUTP Regulations). After this amendment, in March 2022, SEBI conducted search and seizure operations on entities which were reportedly operating 9 telegram channels having over5 million subscribers to whom they were providing recommendations regarding certain selected listed scrips. As per SEBI, these channels had led to the creation of artificial volume and price rise as the investors were induced to deal in the said scrips.\n\nIn this piece, the authors have attempted to analyse the recklessness standard introduced by SEBI through the 2022 amendment in the context of the market manipulation done through social media. The authors have then put under scanner the US jurisdiction wherein this standard is already well established. Thereafter, the authors have given suggestions for the future course of action in this regard.\n\nMeasures Taken by SEBI\n\nThe most significant change that has been brought forth by the 2022 amendment to the PFUTP Regulations is widening the scope of what comes under the ambit of manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice. The relevant regulation in this regard is Regulation 4(2) which enlists the activities of dealing in securities which shall be deemed to be manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice.\n\nThrough the 2018 Amendment, as per Regulation 4 (2)(k) the standard applied was “disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities”. On the contrary, after the 2022 Amendment,  the same regulation has now been worded as “disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading in a reckless or careless manner and which is designed to, or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities”. Prior to this amendment, it was the burden of SEBI to prove intent as to whether the disseminator knew the information or advice to be false and misleading. However, in seminal cases like that of Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Shri Kanaiyalal Baldevbhai Patel and Others, the Apex Court had held, “to attract the rigor of Regulations 3 and 4 of the 2003 Regulations, mens rea is not an indispensable requirement and the correct test is one of preponderance of probabilities”. The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) judgment in S. Gopalakrishnan v. Sebi held “the contention that the term ‘mens rea’ should be broadly construed and recklessness should be equated to be a part of the term ‘mens rea’ is erroneous”. \n\nPost the 2022 amendment, the regulation effectively means that if the said act has been done in a reckless or careless manner without having the ‘knowledge’ that the information is false or misleading then such act shall be deemed to be manipulative, fraudulent, or unfair trade practice. With the introduction of the recklessness standard, it is essential to understand its position within the jurisdiction where it is well established i.e., the US.\n\nPosition in the US\n\nTo see the influence of social media on the securities market in the US, it is essential to note that in January 2021, retail investors hiked the stock price of Gamestop through a coordinated attempt on Reddit. This alleged coordinated market manipulation led to a 1700% increase in the price of the stock and attracted the attention of several regulatory authorities. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published an investor alert highlighting the risks associated with short-term investing and tips available on social media. In the alert, the SEC stated that the fraudsters might resort to pump-and-dump schemes, scalping or touting to manipulate the share price of a company’s stock. Previously, the SEC had even suspended trading accounts of companies that had engaged in suspicious social media activity. \n\nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934 is the key statutory provision regarding the regulation of manipulative and deceptive devices in any national securities exchange. The provision makes it unlawful to “use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [U.S. Securities and Exchange] Commission may prescribe”. This anti-fraud provision has been enforced by the SEC under Rule 10b-5. Rule 10b-5 has been the widely used anti-fraud provision which prevents market manipulation by prohibiting misrepresentations, devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud. In order to prove a violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, recklessness would constitute as scienter.\n\nRecklessness as defined in Sundstrand Corporation v. Sun Chemical Corporation (Sundstrand) is “highly unreasonable [conduct], involving not merely simple, or even inexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care’ which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it”. The court in Sundstrand further went on to expound that the aforementioned definition of recklessness “serve[s] as a proper legally functional equivalent of intent, because it measures conduct against an external standard which, under the circumstances of a given case, results in the conclusion that the reckless man should bear the risk of his [conduct]”.\n\nSection 17(a) of the Securities Act 1933 is another key anti-fraud provision. However, it is relatively less relied upon by the SEC and the private plaintiffs than Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. While prima facie Section 17(a) and Rule 10b-5 appear to be similar, unlike Rule 10b-5, Section 17(a) does not require scienter. This essentially means that SEC or private plaintiffs can use the route of Section 17(a) in situations wherein it is not possible to state a cause of action under Section 10(b) or Rule 10-5. At the same time, it is necessary to clarify that in criminal cases, proof of scienter is required under Section 17(a).\n\nAn individual is held liable under Section 17(a)(2) if they have engaged in the sale of securities while directly or indirectly omitting to state a material fact necessary, leading to market manipulation. This standard has been succinctly laid down in SEC v. Shanahan. Therein it was held that under Section 17(a)(2), the defendant has to act in a manner in which a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the given circumstances. Therefore, the defendant, while communicating any information regarding the purchase and sale of securities, has to exercise reasonable care. An appropriate investigation must be conducted by the defendants before releasing statements to investors or the general public.\n\nAccording to the authors, within the Indian context, the newly introduced standard of recklessness must be applied in the same sense as provided in Sundstrand. This is because the Sundstrand standard is neither too high (as was prior to the amendment) nor too low (as discussed ahead). Further, the key feature of the Sundstrand standard is that it does not include within its purview simple acts of negligence. If the Indian courts while interpreting the recklessness standard were to extend it to include even an act of simple negligence, SEBI would be vested with overbroad powers to conduct search and seizure operations against these social media channels for any information shared through them regarding financial markets. It is essential to note that the purpose of bringing in this standard is to prevent manipulation of market and not impose a blanket ban on all such information sharing. A balance needs to be struck between preventing market manipulation and achieving informational symmetry that happens through these social media channels.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of recklessness standard by the SEBI is definitely a welcome move as it will assist the securities tribunals in curbing instances of dissemination of false and misleading information through social media. While this tweak in the standard of PFUTP Regulations will have a deterring effect on the disseminators, the SEBI should also lay down additional rules to be followed by the disseminators. Every individual recommending any investment strategy must disclose the risks, liabilities, conflict of interests and material sources associated with the financial instrument. \n\nFurther, in many countries as per the current trend, ‘fusion centres’ or ‘fusion cells’ are being created for homeland security. These centres or cells are essentially hubs wherein the data and capabilities of heterogeneous actors are jointly synergized for certain objectives. It is not necessary that such centres only involve members from intelligence or law enforcement agencies, but even private companies or independent experts could be roped in for this. Further, this model could be adapted to include stakeholders from the financial sector.

        "title": "Inclusion of Mutual Funds in PIT Regulations: Narrowly Missing the Bull's Eye",
        "content": "Aryan Puri\nOct 16, 2022\n6 min read\nInclusion of Mutual Funds in PIT Regulations: Narrowly Missing the Bull's Eye\n[Aryan is a student at MIT World Peace University, Faculty of Law, Pune.]\n\nOn 8 July 2022, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a consultation paper recommending that the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015 (PIT Regulations) should be expanded to include units of mutual funds within the scope of securities vis-à-vis insider trading norms. This decision of the market regulator is speculated to have come in the wake of the recent Franklin Templeton crisis and the front-running scandal at Axis Mutual Fund. In both instances, key members of the respective mutual fund schemes redeemed their unit holdings to earn unsolicited profits by using their knowledge of the non-public information. This resulted in the market watchdog recognizing the dire need to implement measures to protect the interest of the investors of the mutual funds, who are not privy to price-sensitive, non-public information due to information parity. \n\nThis post summarizes the inclusion of units of mutual funds in the PIT Regulations and analyses the lack of bandwidth of the codified regulation to incorporate units of mutual funds in its ambit. The post suggests the inclusion of insider trading of mutual funds in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996 (MF Regulations) to ensure uniformity and effective implementation of laws regulating mutual funds.\n\nFranklin Templeton and Axis Mutual Funds\n\nThe mutual funds market took a hit after the Franklin Templeton crisis came to light in April 2020. During the COVID – 19 pandemic, the Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund decided to wind up six of its schemes for redemption on demand by its unitholders. All these schemes had a similar portfolio and sixty-five percent of their portfolios were securities that were AA rated or below. Pursuant to an investigation, it was discovered that several of the fund’s key personnel had withdrawn their holdings in these schemes prior to their winding up announcement to the public. \n\nA similar situation arose in the Axis Mutual Fund scandal wherein the fund manager and the chief dealer were held for ‘front-running’. Front-running is the unlawful trading of securities by a person with prior knowledge of a significant imminent transaction that would impact the prices. Front-running provides the inner circle of the fund including its key personnel unitholders non-public price sensitive information which creates an information parity, providing an unfair advantage to the inner circle for placing an order on the units on basis of the non-public price sensitive information. According to the Regulation 4(2)(q) of the PIT Regulations, “any order in securities placed by a person, while directly or indirectly in possession of information that is not publicly available, regarding a substantial impending transaction in those securities, its underlying securities or its derivative” is a manipulative, fraudulent and unfair practice.\n\nSEBI’s Early Steps \n\nSEBI had made several attempts to address the issue of insider trading in mutual funds in the past by issuing multiple circulars. The circular dated 17 November 2016, regulated and consolidated investment in securities by employees of an asset management company (AMC) and trustees of mutual funds. The circular was recently modified through another circular issued on 28 October 2021 where it was reiterated that employees of an AMC, board members of an AMC and a trust shall not place an order for units in any scheme while being in possession of certain non-public information that could materially alter the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the scheme. These were the early steps taken by SEBI which hinted at the potential inclusion of mutual funds in the PIT Regulations, which was made concrete through the consultation paper. It was a bold step by SEBI to carve a way for the integration of insider trading in mutual funds in a pre-existing jurisprudence having concrete legislation regarding the regulation of insider trading in securities.\n\nAnalysis \n\nCurrently mutual funds are exempted from the scope of PIT Regulations. The fundamental reason for the exclusion was the differentia in trading mutual funds from the securities covered under the PIT Regulations. A mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle wherein investment in equity and debt securities, separately or jointly, are spread across a wide cross-section of industries and sectors, depending upon the risk appetite of the mutual fund unit investor unlike investment in other forms of equity and debt securities that are traded directly on the recognized stock exchanges. Hence, the legislative intent behind PIT regulations of prohibiting insider trading of the directly traded securities, to an extent that the definition of the unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) contained in Regulation 2(n) is strictly restricted to having access to non-public information relating to a single company or any its securities. The structuring of the regulations needs to be reconsidered before inclusion of the framework of mutual funds in its ambit.\n\nDue to the lack of parity in the mechanism of trading, the definition of UPSI for the sake of mutual funds is inherently different from that of other securities, thereby connected persons who have access to the UPSI, specific to mutual funds are also different from that of other securities. For mutual funds, information becomes price sensitive in a situation where it can alter the NAV of the scheme. Such information may include any changes in the investment objectives of the concerned mutual fund scheme, creation of a segregated portfolio; conversion of a close-ended scheme to an open-ended scheme or vice versa, etc. A situation may arise where a person may have UPSI vis-à-vis one specific security which is part of the portfolio of the mutual fund but may not have any explicit knowledge of the fund’s portfolio or any influence on the decision of the working of the fund which could lead such person to benefit from the UPSI of a mutual fund. Additionally, it is pertinent to note that the UPSI associated with a mutual fund is only available to a small group of persons that are associated with the mutual fund, AMC, or a trust.\n\nThe definition of a ‘connected person’ suggested in the consultation paper is far too broad when considered in terms of mutual funds. The definition states that ‘any person’ who is or has during the two months prior to the concerned act been associated with the mutual fund, but it is important to note that everyone who is associated with the mutual fund two months prior to the act will not have access to the UPSI, that could potentially alter the NAV of the scheme. Moreover, the framework contained in the circular dated 28 October 2021, aptly deals with insider trading by ‘designated persons’ for mutual funds which include, key personnel of AMC, trustee company, research analysts, and heads of all divisions. The broad definition of ‘connected person’ will only lead to a increase the compliance burden over the members of the mutual fund scheme, as it would end up including a larger group of people who may have access to USPI relating to securities of a company but may not have potentially NAV altering information relating to the UPSI relating of  units of a mutual fund scheme.\n\nAdditionally, the misfit occurring from the inclusion of mutual funds in the PIT Regulations leads to undue compliances from the modification being made to the definition of ‘securities’ which will now include mutual funds, thereby subjecting mutual funds to all the other pre-clearance compliances and monitoring mechanisms applicable to publicly traded securities. It must be clarified that units of mutual funds will be a part of the definition only for the purpose of the proposed chapters applicable to mutual funds and shall otherwise be excluded. Additionally, clarity is required on whether the PIT Regulations would be applicable to the underlying securities contained in the mutual funds as the definition of securities would now include both, units of mutual funds and securities present in the portfolio of the mutual fund or shall only be applicable to the broader units of mutual funds. \n Proposal\n\nTo tackle similar issues, and to hold mutual fund to the highest ethical standards, SEBI has on past occasions resorted to practices like adding a Code of Conduct, to the MF Regulations, thereby making the MF Regulations the sole statute that regulates mutual funds. This practice eliminates a lot of uncertainty and doubt regarding enforcement. Further, given that mutual funds are not traded in the same way as other forms of publicly traded securities, the PIT Regulations are not necessarily appropriate for addressing the problem of insider trading in mutual funds, as they are primarily directed towards directly traded securities. It could be argued that the incorporation of mutual funds from the perspective of inside trading, rather than being made to the PIT Regulations, would be more effective if made to the MF Regulations. This would make the adoption and enforcement of the modifications relatively straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complications, and adding uniformity to the regulation of mutual funds. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe definitions and concepts contained in the PIT regulations are aimed towards regulating publicly traded securities and not pooled investment vehicles. To make it an effective prohibitory mechanism, for insider trading in mutual funds, the modifications would have to go against the underlying legislative intent of the regulations. It is agreed that the move to address the issue of insider trading in mutual funds, is one in the right direction. However, due to the intrinsic disparity, of mutual funds, with other forms of security, and the pre-existence of the MF Regulations, it would be preferable to consolidate the pre-existing jurisprudence related to the prevention of insider trading of mutual funds, into the MF Regulations, to prevent future uncertainty regarding enforceability. \nMutual FundsPIT RegulationsSEBI\nCorporate Law\n475 views\n16 likes.

        "title": "UK-India Steel Safeguard Impasse and WTO Safeguard Agreement",
        "content": "Bhaskar Vishwajeet\nOct 16, 2022\n7 min read\nUK-India Steel Safeguard Impasse and WTO Safeguard Agreement\n[Bhaskar is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nOn 31 August 2022, India notified the World Trade Organization (WTO) about its proposal to suspend concessions on British trade with India worth USD 250 million. This was a reaction in response to the UK’s decision to extend a package of tariffs on imported steel products by two years. The tariffs package is from 2018, when the UK, as a part of the European Union (EU), introduced measures to safeguard domestic producers from foreign steel exporters. \n\nIn early 2022, the UK government’s newly created Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) suggested that there was no pressing need to extend the tariffs on steel products. This suggestion was ignored, as the then International Trade Secretary, Liz Truss, passed an emergency ordinance to amend the proposal presented to the TRA. It must be noted that the EU also chose to extend the quotas in 2021, extending the period to 2024. \nDespite their exit from the EU, the UK has chosen to retain a majority of the quotas. The limitations on steel products stipulate a certain cap on the tonnage (amount) of steel a country can export to the UK. Overshooting the cap would result in a 25% tariff on the product.\n\nIndia’s chief concern is that such an action on imports is inapposite to the obligations of contracting parties under the WTO agreement, especially the Agreement on Safeguards (SG). As a result, India has requested trade compensation to offset the losses on the export duty of steel products to the tune of USD 248 million. In this piece, the author shall break down the nuances behind the measures, noting the remedies available to both parties and a prospective way ahead.    \n\nLegal Standard for Safeguards\n\nThe WTO is an international organization that facilitates trade liberalization. It is a forum where governments approach each other and negotiate trade logistics and have access to an amenable dispute resolution mechanism. The WTO’s process is driven by an older set of rules enshrined in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT). Under this regime, the SG lays down rules for “safeguard measures”. A safeguard measure is any emergency action taken as a result of sudden surge in the import of a class of products to address damage or possible damage to a member state’s domestic industries. Such measures may vary from reconsidering concessions provided to quantitative restrictions on the import of said products. \n\nArticle XIX of the GATT speaks of emergency actions on imported products. It stipulates that if the obligations incurred due to trade with another country result in an unforeseen influx of goods from that country, the importing country would be free to suspend or modify concessions on said imported goods. These concessions are undertakings exchanged between WTO member states that reaffirm mutual arrangements concerning a substantial reduction of tariffs and barriers to global trade. Suspensions and modifications to concessions are labelled as safeguards. \n\nUsing Article XIX as a guiding principle, the SG establishes rules for applying safeguard measures. Article 2 (SG) states that a safeguard measure may be applied when a member state has objectively assessed import circumstances. The assessment of injury to the domestic industry must be carried out by competent authorities within the contracting member state. It is not based on the product’s country of origin. The threshold to impose such limitations, however, must be beyond mere injury to domestic industries, it must be a serious injury.\n\nArticle 4 of the SG defines serious injury as a significant overall impairment to the position of a domestic industry of a contracting party. Similarly, a threat of serious injury must indicate an imminent threat to the position of an industry. The position of a domestic industry is key in understanding the objective of this rule. Domestic industries that produce similar products or are like imported products are likely to face competition along qualitative or quantitative metrics. This rule provides a contracting party’s domestic industry with a fair chance to position itself in the global markets. \n\nSuch measures, however, must be temporary. This is required to further the cause of ‘progressively liberalizing’ the measure. Member states are free to impose safeguards reasonably, but the SG stipulates that they must ensure a gradual relaxation of the application of the safeguard. This must be supplemented with providing compensation to the exporting member states whose trade may be affected negatively concerning that particular class of products. \n\nIndia’s Contentions\n\nIndia’s communication to the Council for Trade in Goods mentions four grounds of dispute against to the UK’s safeguard measures. They are broadly based on the following:\nOn the evidence of serious injury\n\nThe SG is replete with the requirement that to apply a safeguard measure, the Committee on Safeguards must be supplied with objective evidence of serious injury to a domestic industry. In Article 12.3 (SG), member states proposing to apply safeguards must consult with member states having a substantial interest in the export of a particular product. This is in furtherance of the objective of Article 8, which prescribes adequate means of trade compensation to counter the adverse effects of the extension of a measure. India has claimed that it has a substantial interest in the steel sector and that the imposition of such a measure will cause harm to its export cycles. India has mentioned that the safeguards have led to a decline in exports weighing 2,19,000 tons, amounting to a duty of USD 248 million. To that end, they have claimed that there are legal inconsistencies in the evidence presented to satisfy the serious injury threshold.\nOn the duration of the safeguard measures\n\nArticle 7 (SG) states that a safeguard measure may be applied only for such a period as necessary to correct a serious injury and facilitate adjustment to competition. Such period shall not be more than four years unless the competent authorities have determined further extension. Such extensions, however, must be cognizant of the compensatory measures (Article 8) which must be undertaken to make good any losses faced by exporting member states.\n\nThe overall objective of the SG and associated agreements under the WTO is to work towards a better state of progressive liberalization. To progressively liberalize is to gradually loosen any and, if appropriate, all restrictions to global trade and exchange. David Ricardo posited that states cannot exist in isolation, instead, they have to demonstrate a comparative advantage to other states. A comparative advantage is any domestic specialization or manufacturing/resource expertise which gives a country an advantage in that sector. For example, India has a comparative advantage in high speed steel products. An exchange of comparative advantages is the base logic behind trade liberalization and globalization. Member states enter into agreements with each other with the undertaking that they will respect the notion of liberalization. \n\nTo facilitate adjustment when a safeguard exceeds three years in duration, the member applying such a measure must review the situation halfway through the term of the measure and either withdraw it or increase the pace of liberalization (Article 7.4). Extensions cannot be more restrictive than the initial plans. \n\nThe UK government’s initial plan for 2021 covered ten steel products, but the recent extension in June 2022 includes all 15 steel products as mentioned in the schedule of the notification. India claims that this is against the objectives of progressive liberalization as captured in the SG.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIndia has expressed no reluctance to avail its right of suspending concessions and obligations on trade with the UK. Article 8.2 (SG) allows an exporting member state to suspend all concessions on a member state within 90 days of the application of such a measure if no agreement is achieved between the member state proposing the safeguard measure and exporting member states. Such reciprocal or retaliatory suspensions can be imposed only after 30 days from consultations. The agreement in this context explicitly refers to the question of trade compensation to offset the adverse effects of the safeguard measures imposed by the UK. India has proposed to impose retaliatory tariffs. Products ranging from blended whisky to animal feed and precious stones would be subject to an equivalent tariffs package if the UK does not comply with India’s requests. India expects to be able to offset the decline in exports by imposing customs duties on about USD 250 million worth of goods originating in the UK.\n\nIndia, however, may not have to proceed with such drastic measures. The recent flash currency shocks and bond-market scare in the UK have created enough disarray among the ranks to stifle the leadership into reconsidering its economic scheme. Despite containing the crisis to a significant level, inflation in the UK is still on the rise. Tariffs on imported products essentially drive their price up. In an economy already trying to boost consumer spending while battling with reeling inflation targets (2.5% now), imposing duties on products may appease domestic producers/manufacturers but may result in limiting options for consumers. Steel, a global commodity, is priced relative to the USD (for benchmarks). A weaker pound (relative to the USD) does not help the UK’s case, as the input costs for domestic manufacturing that used imported steel will shoot up due to the additional tariffs. India should wait till the government’s policy decisions on interest rate renewals are finalized and any announcement on tariff quotas are made. \n India had indicated its intention to impose retaliatory customs of a similar nature previously as well. In 2021, India proposed duties on the EU’s tariffs package on steel products. In 2018, India and the EU proposed customs duties on US exports due to the US tariffs on Indian aluminum products. This shows that India reserves the right to impose retaliatory customs duties against a good number of safeguard measures. However, such policy decisions must be well thought out and weigh the strategic relations between member states. Recent negotiations with the United Kingdom for a Free Trade Agreement demonstrate a friendlier intent on the UK’s part. In light of the same, it cannot be presumed that India will necessarily retaliate. \n\nAs officials negotiate the terms of compensation, we may drift away from the realm of the SG. Regarding compensation, the UK has agreed to be open to reconsidering equivalent measures under Article 8.1. This must be assessed against the backdrop of the prospective India – UK Free Trade Agreement, which has been delayed for quite some time. To conclude, it depends on whether the FTA between India and the UK sees the light of day. If it does, harsh considerations like so may be diluted by the parties' mutually acceptable and proportionate measures, improving a promising trade relationship.\nWTOUKTrade Remedies AuthorityAgreement on Safeguards\nTrade Law\n127 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "How LBOs Can Be the Answer to India's NPA Crisis",
        "content": "Hrithik Merchant\nOct 11, 2022\n5 min read\nHow LBOs Can Be the Answer to India's NPA Crisis\n[Hrithik is a student at National Law School of India University, Bangalore.]\n\nIndia is in the midst of a crisis in the banking sector – non-performing assets (NPAs) with their heads under the water. The RBI, in its report, asserted that the gross NPA ratio was 6.9% in September 2021 and the absolute value of bad loans was at INR 8.37 lakh crore. This is after banks wrote off bad loans of more than INR 2 lakh crores. COVID-19 also contributed to the decline in lending. For a healthy economy, funds need to be pumped into start-ups and mature business companies.\n\nPrivate equity, a massive success in the West, is garnering significant traction in India. Due to regulatory environment, companies are being coerced to divest their assets and resulting in attraction of considerable private equity interest. However, the Indian legal landscape brings in a lot of barriers to the achievement of full potential of private equity. One such barrier is the practical impossibility of leveraged buy-outs (LBO) in India. \n\nIn this piece, I argue in two prongs that the legal barriers to LBOs should be obviated to allow for better approach to the NPA problem. First, I delineate the general functioning of LBOs, which unlock the keys to the NPA crisis. Second, I pose the present legal regime and how it encumbers any possible LBO.\n\nLBO – The Ideology and its Traction in the West\n\nIn the West, private equity’s dramatic growth was attributed to aggressive use of debt. A key mechanism in this story has been leveraged buyouts. In an LBO, the investor finances the acquisition of the portfolio company through both debt and equity. The investor ensures that she herself does not commit a huge amount of capital. The assets and cash inflow of the company are used as securities for the debt portion. Thus, the PE fund buys out shares of a publicly listed company so that it becomes delisted and therefore private. The debt, having a lower cost of capital than equity, is employed by the investor as a leverage to increase the returns on the investment. Ordinarily, the debt to equity ratio is 70:30. The portfolio company is then subjected to “adhere to strict, results-oriented financial projections” and “operate the company within tight budgetary and operational constraints”. Therefore, this serves as an important revival mechanism for economically suffering companies by remodeling and restructuring them using debt. \n\nNPAs have been defined as loans or advances for which the principal amount of the interest has been overdue for a period of more than 90 days. In their ledger, banks often classify it as a loss. Essentially, NPAs would include companies making losses. In my opinion, LBOs can step in to provide some hope of revival. The risk and corresponding returns are high in LBOs and would suit NPAs.\n\nLegal Barriers to LBOs\n\nIn the Indian context, there have been LBOs since the Tata Tea’s LBO of the UK’s Tetley for 271 million euros in 2000. Many other multi-million and multi-billion LBOs funded by Indian companies followed suit. However, in all these transactions, the target has never been Indian. This is because the provisions stipulated in the Companies Act 2013, the RBI’s master circular, the FIPB’s press note, the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011, the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002, and the SEBI guidelines work in tandem to block LBOs for Indian targets. It becomes imperative to closely examine at each of these legislations.\n\nThe RBI explicitly prohibits banks from providing loans and advances where the purpose of the loan is to purchase the shares of an Indian company. The Master Circular on Loan and Advances of July 2015 permits collateral for secured loans only for ‘working capital’ or ‘other productive purposes’. This, in effect, prevents PE funds from utilizing assets of a portfolio company as security for purchasing the portfolio company’s shares. The rationale behind this provision stems from the RBI’s conservative approach to ensure the safety of domestic banks. The domestic banks are not supposed to make advances on the basis of shares of the portfolio company and rather, the promoter or investor should fund the investments from their own pocket. The RBI also observed that banks work closely with private investors due to the multiplicity of transactions for the bank’s own growth. Thus, they recommended limiting the bank’s exposure to the capital market.\n\nNow, it may be posited that banks are not the sole financial institutions and in fact, they only contributed to 50% of debt for LBOs in the EU in 2007. However, in the Indian capital market, the non-banking institutions are not developed enough and banks remain the primary source of capital. Non-banking financial institutions lack the structure to fund big-ticket LBOs.\n\nIn my opinion, this approach should be discarded. These transactions have been a part of successful PE environment in other jurisdictions and the same can be mirrored in India, if we lay down the correct infrastructure. This infrastructure would encapsulate corporate governance and sufficient checks and balances on the banks with their relations with private investors and private pool of capital. \n\nSection 67(2) of the Companies Act 2013 forbids a public company or a private company that is a subsidiary of a public company from providing financial assistance for the purpose of subscribing or purchasing shares of other companies. Understandably, the purpose of this section was to combat trafficking company’s own shares in order to influence the price. Unfortunately, the legislators did not take into account the possibility of buyouts. Therefore, any asset provided by a company for such transaction will be therefore disallowed. In my view, the law should be amended to allow buyouts but at the same time provide an exception to prevent trafficking shares.\n\nThe FIPB served as the apex body and clearing authority for all foreign direct investment up to the amount of INR 1,200 crores. Through Press Note 9, it prevents Indian banks from lending money to foreign investors for the purpose of purchasing or subscribing shares of Indian companies. Therefore, these rules, along with the RBI guidelines, work in a pincer movement to make any possibility of LBOs by foreign PE fund bleak. Moreover, foreign PE funds need FIPB’s approval to open holding companies in India. Thus, a paradigm shift in government policy (both FDI policy and RBI policy) for Indian banks is needed to stimulate LBOs. \n\nThe foundation of private equity lies in the strategy of buying to sell. Exit process form the basis of every PE investment. In an LBO, the average time for exit is seven to ten years and the most common method is initial public offering. SEBI’s Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations 2018 lay down stringent guidelines which a newly revived company my find hard to comply with. For instance, pursuant to Regulation 6(1), prerequisites such as net tangible assets of INR 3 crore in the preceding three years and pre-tax operating profit around INR 15 crore in three out of last five years has to be fulfilled. Such a requirement is extremely onerous for an NPA.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe lack of conducive regulatory conditions for LBOs have resulted in minority investment based private equity model in India. However, at this juncture, we should recall the 2013 efforts of RBI where it mooted reforms to allow banks to finance entities that perform LBOs. This was also done in the backdrop of the issue of augmenting NPAs and it is time we take inspirations from the West’s traditional model of private equity.  \nLeveraged Buy-OutsNPARBI\nCorporate Law\n281 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Strike-off by RoC under Companies Act 2013: An Action Too Harsh on Companies?",
        "content": "Rupa Veena S, Shariba Tasneem\nOct 11, 2022\n7 min read\nStrike-off by RoC under Companies Act 2013: An Action Too Harsh on Companies?\n[Rupa and Shariba are students at School of Law, Christ (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru.]\n\n‘Striking-off’ means the removal of a company’s name from the register of companies by the Registrar of Companies (RoC). A company does not enjoy legal existence once its name is struck-off from the register of companies. Striking-off occurs either when RoC strikes off a company’s name as per their powers provided under Section 248(1) of the Companies Act 2013 (Act) or when a company voluntarily applies to RoC to be struck off as per Section 248(2) of the Act. While striking off a company on a suo moto basis, the RoC has to comply with Rule 3 of Companies (Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules 2016, which excludes certain companies from the applicability of strike-off provisions.\n\nIn August 2022, the Union Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Mr. Rao Inderjit Singh, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha stated that “4,32,796 companies were struck off during the last five years”.  He had also stated that a Special Task Force was set up by the government to look into the issue of 'shell companies' and strike them off. Considering the large number of companies being struck off in the last five years, it is pertinent to understand the reasons behind their strike off. On this account, this article analyses RoC’s suo moto powers to strike off under Section 248(1). Additionally, it traverses through various cases decided by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) concerning strike-off and examines if such strike-off provisions are adversely affecting the ease of doing business. \n\nRoC’s Powers to Remove the Company’s Name from Register of Companies\n\nSection 248(1) of the Act lays down conditions under which the RoC can exercise its powers to strike off a company suo moto. First, there must be a reasonable cause to show that a company has not commenced its business within one year of its incorporation. Second, there must be a reasonable cause to show that a company is not operational for two immediately preceding financial years and has not made any application within such period for obtaining the status of a dormant company under Section 455 of the Act. The RoC, before striking off the name of the company suo moto must send a notice to the directors of the company expressing the intention to strike off the name of the company, thereby giving them a chance to represent themselves with relevant documents. Such notice should also be published in the Official Gazette for public knowledge. Moreover, aggrieved companies can approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) with an appeal, if they are dissatisfied with RoC’s order. \n\nAppeal to NCLT under Companies Act 2013\n\nSection 252 of the Companies Act 2013 provides for an appeal to the NCLT against an order passed under Section 248 of the Act. If a person is aggrieved by RoC’s order, they can approach the NCLT for restoration of the company’s name in the register of companies, within 3 (three) years from the date of such order. Section 252 of the Act also empowers the RoC to approach the tribunal if the name has been struck off inadvertently. Before the introduction of Act, Section 560 (6) of the Companies Act 1956 (1956 Act) dealt with such appeals. Section 560(6) was limited in its scope as it allowed only the company or the members or the creditors to file an appeal to the court, whereas the applicable law as on date allows any aggrieved person to file an appeal. This ensures that any stakeholder of the company who is dissatisfied by the order of RoC can seek relief.\n\nUnder Section 560(6) of the 1956 Act, the RoC had to send another notice to the company if it did not reply within one month from the date of the first notice, this provision was done away within the present law. Accordingly, the 1956 Act gave the companies a better opportunity to be heard. The parties can also appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), if they are dissatisfied by the order of the NCLT. The same is open to further appeal under Article 32 and 226 of the Indian Constitution. \n\nInstances Where Companies Were Revived by the Tribunals\n\nIn the case of Vikas Sureshbhai Patel v. the Registrar of Companies, Gujarat, when the company failed to file annual financial reports for three  consecutive financial years, it received a show cause notice from the RoC, in a reply to which the company’s director requested for three months in order to comply with the filing. However, RoC did not issue any reply and the company was struck off after considering non-filing of annual accounts and annual returns for three years as a ground. The company filed an appeal before the NCLT, which rejected the same and upheld the RoC's decision to strike off. Subsequently, the company approached NCLAT. NCLAT asserted that the main reason for the striking off is the non-filing of financial statements by a non operative company for two immediately preceding years. In this case, the company was in operation, and the default of non-filing of financial statements was curable in nature. Therefore, non-filing of financial statements inadvertently was held to be no ground for striking off the company’s name from the RoC’s records.\n\nIn the case of M/s Subh Laxmi Colonizers Private Limited v. ROC, Delhi, the company failed to file financial statements for two years and there was no record of land ownership. On the company's appeal, NCLT did not restore the company’s name. Therefore, the company approached NCLAT.  NCLAT held that RoC was only dissatisfied about the company not filing the financial statements and thereby assumed that it was not operational. It also held that such companies are small and their businesses are erratic considering the nature of real estate business, especially during the pandemic. It restored the name of the company under the umbrella of grounds of 'just' after the company pays penalties and decided that RoC is free to take any other legal actions against the company for non-filing of financial statements.\n\nA similar judgment was passed in the case of M.A. Panjwani v. Registrar of Companies and Another  by the Delhi High Court, where the petitioner was not a member or creditor according to the requirements of Section 560(6) of the 1956 Act which was necessary to file a case. The petitioner was allotted shares in this case which were later transferred without his consent, the court held that it was ‘just’ to construe that the petitioner was a creditor for the purposes of restoration of the company.\n\nIn the case of Deorao Shriram Kalkar and Another v. RoC, although the company’s balance sheet and profit and loss account statements showed that they were unoperational and did not earn any revenuw, the court noted that the company had a fixed deposit with the Bank of Maharashtra and was earning interest and paying income tax. This was seen as sufficient to show that the company was making attempts to be operational and therefore, restored the company. The court also added that the NCLT and the RoC had been incorrect to decide the matter without taking into consideration the company’s response.  \n\nThrough the cases discussed, it is evident that the RoC, in several instances, has failed to adhere to the condition mentioned in Section 248 of the Act, by virtue of which the companies enjoy a fair opportunity to be heard before their names are struck off. Arguably, this non-adherence has resulted in most companies approaching the NCLAT. Furthermore, when the RoC fails to act on the replies to the notice received from the companies, its decisions fail to conform with the principles of natural justice. \n\nConclusion \n\nAlthough India’s rank in ease of doing business according to the World Bank Report has improved to 62 in 2019 from 142 in 2014, several companies continue to be struck off for curable defects. Further, as per a report by XKDR forum on cases decided by NCLT, in the period between 2018 and 2020, 16.67% of the cases involved the restoration of struck-off companies. There are few benches, such as Hyderabad where almost 50% of the cases were related to the revival of struck-off companies. \nAdequately addressing strike-off cases may be tedious in view of the NCLT’s existing caseload. It is not only overburdening NCLT but is also a time-consuming process for the companies to restore their companies. Furthermore, as also acknowledged by NCLAT in the case of M/s Subh Laxmi Colonizers Private Limited v. ROC, Delhi, business operations for several entities have been erratic due to the pandemic, and companies deserve another chance to revive their businesses under the grounds of the ‘just’ principle.\n\nFurther, instead of directly striking-off the companies without due consideration of their response to the show cause notice, the RoC must give the company another chance to revive its business within a certain period if it is not operational. Making a settlement with the company at the RoC’s level may significantly save time and costs. Given that the Central Government has direct administrative control over the offices of RoC, it is recommended that a separate appellate authority may be appointed under the Central Government’s aegis to hear appeals from aggrieved struck-off companies instead of  having them approach the already overburdened NCLT. \n\nMoreover, since Section 248 does not define as to what entails ‘operational business’ and ‘non-operational business,’ different authorities have interpreted the same in a different manner. While the RoC, in many cases, has considered several companies to be non-operational merely on the ground of non-filing of financial statements, thereby striking them off, NCLT and NCLAT have, in many cases, textually interpreted the statute to hold that if a company, while operational, failed to file financial statements, will not amount to being non-operational and therefore, not open to a ‘strike-off’. \n\nMoreover, with a special task force being set up by the Central Government to identify and strike-off shell companies, it becomes imperative to clearly demarcate what constitutes ‘operational’ and ‘non-operational companies. Although the Central Government is well-intended to strike-off shell companies to curb illegal activities, small companies with erratic businesses who make inadvertent mistakes might take the fall in view of the interpretational ambiguity.\nCompanies ActRoCShell CompaniesStrike-Off\nCorporate Law\n589 views\n4 likes.

        "content": "Amar Gupta\nOct 9, 2022\n4 min read\nRainbow Papers Judgment: A Step Backwards in Insolvency\n[Amar is a Partner at JSA. The following article was first published on Lexology.]\n\nIn its decision in Ghanashyam Mishra and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (Ghanashyam Mishra), a bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court of India held that “harmonious construction of clause (10) of Section 3 of the I&B Code read with clauses (20) and (21) of Section 5 thereof would reveal, that even a claim in respect of dues arising under any law for the time being in force and payable to the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority would come within the ambit   of ‘operational debt’. The Central Government, any State Government or any local authority to whom an operational debt is owed would come within the ambit of ‘operational creditor’ as defined under sub­section (20) of Section 5 of the I&B Code.”  \n\nThe court then went on to hold that any debts in respect of payment of dues arising under law, including those owed to the Central Government, any state government or any local authority, which do not form a part of the approved resolution plan, shall stand extinguished. Further, once a resolution plan is duly approved by the Adjudicating Authority, the claims provided in the resolution plan shall stand frozen and will be binding on all stakeholders. The phrase ‘all stakeholders’ includes the government or any other authority.\n\nThe decision assured the prospective resolution applicants that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (“Code”) does not accord any special treatment to statutory dues and the claims of government authorities. These claims and dues will fall in the category of operational debt, and they can be dealt with and provided for in the same manner as any other operational debt. The authoritative pronouncement on this issue by the court reinforced the ‘clean slate’ theory propounded by it to bolster the insolvency law regime under the Code and brought stability to it.\n\nThat is until another bench perceived the issue differently and reached a totally contrary conclusions, yet again, without engaging with the binding precedents.\n\nSection 48 of Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003 creates first charge on the property of a dealer. In Sales Tax Officer (1) v. Rainbow Papers Limited (Rainbow Papers), a case decided by two Judges bench of the Supreme Court, it was argued that the charge so created on the assets of the corporate debtor qualifies as ‘security interest’ under the Code and the tax department was, therefore, a ‘secured creditor’ for the purpose of Section 53 of the Code (order of priority of creditors for distribution of proceeds of liquidation assets). The appellant also challenged the rejection of the claim on the ground that it was belated. The court accepted the argument of the state and held that state was a ‘secured creditor’. It also ruled that the timeline prescribed under the Code for the various stages of the proceeding under it is directory and not mandatory, and the state’s claim for statutory dues could not have been ignored on account of delay. With the two issues answered, the court could have, and I submit, should have concluded the determination. But it did not.\n\nThe court proceeded to expound on the treatment of debts owed to the state government and public authorities. It observed “if the resolution plan ignores the statutory demands payable to any state government or a legal authority. Altogether, the adjudicating authority is bound to reject the plan”. The court then said that “if a company is unable to pay its debts, which should include its statutory dues to the government and/or authorities and there is no plan which contemplates dissipation of those debts in a phased manner, uniform proportional reduction, the company would necessarily have to be liquidated and its assets sold and distributed in the manner stipulated in section 53 of IBC”.\n\nThese observations have drastic consequences. The plain meaning of these observation is that the resolution plan must mandatorily provide for payment of statutory dues and the debts owed to government and public authorities. A resolution plan must make provision for such debts and provide “dissipation of those debts in a phased manner”, else “the company would necessarily have to be liquidated and its assets sold and distributed….” Quite clearly, these observations are directly in conflict with the ruling in Ghanshyam Mishra and knocks the bottom out of the ‘clean slate’ theory which has been the cornerstone of insolvency law regime in India.\n\nOne could argue that these observations are not the ratio decidendi (rationale for the decision) of the judgment but obiter dicta (observations made in the passing). If it were a decision of a High Court, one could have thus ignored these observations as not binding. However, since this is a decision of the Supreme Court, even the obiter dicta will be binding on the lower courts, and most certainly the NCLT, the forum for resolution of debt under the Code.\n\nThe judgment in Rainbow Papers requires immediate review, else it will have deleterious impact on the insolvency law regime under the Code. It will deter potential bidders due to additional risks and uncertainty on account of pending or potential statutory and government demands. Thus, there will be fewer bidders, lower valuations, and, consequently, larger haircuts for the creditors.\nCodeInsolvencyRainbow PapersSupreme Court\nInsolvency Law\n1,744 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "content": "Sidharrth Shankar\nOct 9, 2022\n4 min read\nSome Cures, Some Lingering Ailments\n[Sidharrth is a Partner at JSA. The following article was published on The Financial Express and Lexology.]\n\nThe draft Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill 2022 (Bill) gets it right on the regulation of medical devices but continues with a drug inspection regime that lacks transparency.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the much-awaited ‘Heal in India’ announcement, the Bill is insignificant. Indian pharma, healthcare, and allied sectors have been beset by a plethora of problems in the legal and regulatory domain. So, meaningful reform is a dire need.\n\nAs early as 1988, the government brought a set of rules for Indian pharma, and established a systematic framework. This could have been a viable blueprint of the overall regulatory aspects had it not lost direction and decisive implementation. On the other hand, aggressive and forward-looking markets worldwide have changed their compliance gears towards good manufacturing practices (GMPs) rather than adhering to mere manufacturing. This has ensured that drugs go through a progressive scan of quality checks and tests. Secondly, transparency in the drug inspectors’ publication of inspection reports in India is, sadly, lacking.\n\nWhereas meagre information in respect of tests conducted by the drug inspectors can be gleaned only via the right to information in India, US law mandates the publication of all such inspection reports. Thirdly, the lack of criminal prosecution of companies that fail to comply with the GMPs is yet another drawback for regulators to get a grip on the market overall. Unlike the US, India does not prescribe criminal penalties for defaulting companies. While there may be a cancellation of licences at the most, there are no metrics to determine the standards applied by the drug inspections. Without publicly available information, transparency in India is not up to par.\n\nEnforcement has been a focal point in all review-related forums and legislative moments in India. Here, with 37 nodal agencies across states and Union Territories, it is no less than regulatory ‘chaos’. These nodal agencies, under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) umbrella that, in turn, is controlled by the Union health ministry, make up the drug regulation landscape. CDSCO’s role is restricted to regulating imported and new drugs with clinical evidence and available information. As this, too, is in coordination with the health ministry, there are ensuing complications.\n\nHimachal Pradesh is the pharma production hub. Regulatory fever here incentivises the ‘ease of manufacturing drugs’. Tax holidays have been amplified by lenient enforcement of applicable laws, GMPs, etc. Furthermore, India’s regulatory model allows drugs shipped out of hubs like Himachal Pradesh to be sold in states like Karnataka and Gujarat, where far more stringent and competent regulation is enforced. So, ultimately, a mixed bag hits the markets. This was precisely why the Mashelkar Committee in 2003 had strongly emphasized the need for centralised regulation and drug licensing, to enable uniform quality control for all drug companies in India. Merely vesting powers with the drug regulators only helps profiteering at the expense of the nation’s public health. All critical information about an approved drug should be available to the public; all possible vital data that would benefit doctors, citizens, and companies, should be published. Such disclosure adds accountability to the authority of drug regulators. The Bill, which should have been proactive on this, unfortunately, has no such provision. Robust transparency via public hearings where even doctors can access facts on why a particular clinical trial of a new drug could have failed or passed is needed.\n\nThe Bill demands the appointment of 219 new officials, but this is limited to hiring more inspectors, not technical experts. Such negligence distances the Indian market from public health.\n\nThe Bill introduces rigorous discipline in case of non-compliance. In addition, penalties, including imprisonment, could be imposed if compensation for injury/death is not honoured when clinical trials for drugs are unsuccessful. Currently, these regulations are governed as per the Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules 2019. For the first time, these regulations would apply not only to drugs but also to medical devices, which is a huge positive.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, the online pharmacy players are likely to challenge the provision on the ‘need for acquiring a license’ to continue operations, as it would be a significant regulatory blow to the e-pharmacy space.\n\nUntil now, the medical device sector had no special mention, definition, or provision separately outlined. The Bill acknowledges the medical devices sector as a separate legal entity instead of clubbing this with drugs. The revised provisions will also cover clinical trials of new medical devices etc. with a more comprehensive understanding of the stakeholder perspective. This extends to setting up a separate Medical Device Advisory Board on the lines of a Drug Advisory Board. Separate Drugs Technical Advisory Board and Medical Devices Technical Advisory Board have also been proposed, comprising subject matter experts.\n\nWhile Vietnam is merging several existing drug and healthcare laws to simplify compliance, New Zealand’s ministry of health is gearing up to regulate natural health products via a self-assessment/ declaration process. This speaks volumes of the wisdom and maturity that these markets have shown, striking a balance between profits, public health, and regulation. India needs to take their cue from the quality benchmarks of such markets and the US to create a wholesome future.\n\nDrugsMedical DevicesCosmeticsBill\nLaw and Policy\n31 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Insider Trading and Mens Rea: Indian Jurisprudence, Comparative Developments and the Way Forward",
        "content": "Shruti Avinash\nOct 8, 2022\n5 min read\nInsider Trading and Mens Rea: Indian Jurisprudence, Comparative Developments and the Way Forward\n[Shruti is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nThe recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court (SC) -- that the mere possession of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI), in the absence of profit motive, is insufficient to prove insider trading -- may significantly bolster the Indian position on mens rea in insider trading jurisprudence. \n\nCentral Issues and Status Quo\n\nInsider trading is unlawful in India as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 2002. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015 with the intention of outlawing and regulating insider trading in India. The central issue in the present case is the agreements between Gammon Infrastructure Projects Limited (Gammon India) and Simplex Infrastructures Limited (Simplex Infrastructures). Under these agreements, Gammon India and Simplex Infrastructures agreed to invest 49% equity capital into the projects of the other company. These arrangements were subsequently terminated in 2013. \n\nOn 22 September 2013, Gammon India's Chairman and Managing Director, Mr. Abhijit Rajan, transacted the sale of 14.4 million shares of the company. Concurrently, there was no public announcement of  the termination of the projects until 30 September 2013. The eventual revelation caused a significant increase in the price of Gammon India's shares since it was now the sole owner of the road project. SEBI then issued an order against him in response to allegations that Rajan had engaged in unlawful insider trading. The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) issued a verdict in 2019 that went in Rajan's favor, which was subsequently challenged by SEBI before the SC. \n\nKey Provisions\n\nThe SEBI passed the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendments) Regulations 2018 (PIT Regulations), in order to prohibit 'dealing in securities', which is defined as buying, selling, or agreeing to buy, sell, or deal in any securities by any person either as principal or agent, by insiders on the basis of any ‘unpublished price sensitive information’. On a broad reading of these provisions, insiders are prohibited from disclosing or discussing any confidential information with other parties. It is necessary for the transmission or revelation of the content at issue for the act to be against the law. Hence, the previous standard of there being an innocent tippee liability is not entirely accepted as being equitable. \n\nInsider Trading in the USA\n\nOn the other hand, potential defendants in economic crime cases who might face prosecution in the United States have very strong cause to fear that they will be found guilty. It is a widely held belief that the US law enforcement for economic offenses will go much further under the administration of President Joe Biden. \n\nAt present, Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibits officers, directors, and other employees who have access to non-public information from trading on the company's shares with the intention of generating a profit (or avoiding a loss) as a result of the information confidentially. The disclosure of confidential information to third parties, also known as 'tipping', is strictly forbidden under this provision. \n\nRule 10b-5 indeed encompasses a scope that is far larger than that of officers, directors, and major investors. This regulation applies to any employee of the company who trades (i.e., buys or sells) the company's stock or other securities after obtaining non-public information about the company or receiving a \"tip\" from an insider of the company regarding material, non-public information about the company, with the standard of the fiduciary relationship or duty having been established in the case of United States v. Newman. Due to this, the rules have been broader, and the burden of proof has more definitely been moved from the prosecution to the defendants. \n\nHowever, the US Supreme Court has remained invested in expounding the importance of intention (\"wilfulness\") in insider trading- while laying the groundwork for a reliable standard to determine this criterion. In the case of United States v. Dixon, Friendly J. found that \"innocent mistake, ignorance, or inadvertence\" are not included in the definition of \"wilful\". The court went on to decide in the above-mentioned case that the \"wilfulness\" threshold is satisfied when an actor deliberately disregards or disobeys securities laws while being aware that doing so involves a considerable risk of breaking the law.\n\nIn an attempt to shed light on the meaning of \"wilfulness\", Judge William B. Herlands wrote an article titled \"Criminal Law Aspects of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\" In this, he argued that the prosecution need only prove that the defendant \"realized on his part that he was doing a wrongful act,\" rather than proving that the defendant had prior knowledge of the relevant statute or rule. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has generally adopted this ruling in securities fraud cases.\n\nInsider Trading as a Public Welfare Offense (PWO)\n\nOne of the arguments against engaging in insider trading is the concern that the market would suffer adverse effects if just a select few players were able to profit from significantly material non-public information. That might be detrimental to people's confidence in the economy, causing the public to grow apprehensive of investing their money into the financial markets. \n\nThose who have access to information that is not readily available to the public may be able to defend themselves against losses and benefit from any upswings. This brings the risk that would otherwise be borne by investors to a level that is more manageable, given that they now have access to the information. As a result of the public's lack of trust in the markets, businesses may have a more difficult time securing access to finance through the primary financial markets. Therefore, characterizing these aspects and repercussions of insider trading as a PWO would mean that mens rea is not necessary - thus supporting the previous Indian position on this aspect.\n\nAnalysis\n\nRegulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations prohibits trading in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock exchange when in possession of UPSI. Further, there exists a rebuttable presumption of motivation in the possessor of such UPSI. \n\nArguably, the ambiguity in the meaning of ‘intent’ or ‘motivation’ may undermine the intended deterrent effect of insider trading laws. In law per se, the mere fact of possession of UPSI should not be considered sufficient grounds to constitute insider trading because the majority of directors and senior executive people of a firm would have access to the aforementioned information. Additionally, this can deter prospective investors from investing money into the company or being engaged in its management.\n            In the present case, the shares were sold by Rajan. The SC ruled that there was, nonetheless, no clear profit motive involved as the transactions were likely to result in loss.  \n\nA reference to previous cases may be relevant here. It was the previous position in the contentious case of Reliance Petroinvestments Limited and Rajiv B Gandhi v. SEBI that if a person trades while in knowledge of UPSI, it is presumed that they engaged in insider trading. In addition, the Bombay High Court ruled in the case SEBI v. Cabot International Capital Corporation that the SEBI Act and related regulations are meant to control the securities market and associated elements. Further, the imposition of penalties under the insider trading regime cannot be disputed on the premise of \"no mens rea, no punishment.\" \n\nConclusion\n\nIn view of the above, it is necessary that the Indian law develops a cohesive standard based on mens rea, either through legislative provisions or judicial precedents, to prevent any wrongdoer from escaping accountability on the pretext of ambiguity and to provide the market with a clear notion of what behavior draws culpability. Such clarity may bolster confidence in various categories of market participants.\nInsider TradingSEBIMens ReaUPSI\nCorporate Law\n725 views\n2 likes. Post not marked as liked\n2"

        "title": "Selective Reduction of Shares: Balancing Decision-Making Autonomy vis-à-vis Corporate Governance",
        "content": "Priyanshu Shrivastava, Chirag Chachad\nOct 4, 2022\n6 min read\nSelective Reduction of Shares: Balancing Decision-Making Autonomy vis-à-vis Corporate Governance\n[Priyanshu and Chirag are students at National Law University, Jodhpur.]\n\nReduction of share capital, as the term suggests, pertains to the decision of a company to reduce the equity shareholding either selectively or equally through share cancellations, or repurchases/buybacks. The said reduction can be done for reasons such as restructuring the capital, or to reduce the payment of dividends, or to remedy the balance sheets. However, in ‘selective’ reduction of shares, there is differential treatment with some shareholders; which sometimes can amount to extinguishing some of the shareholders’ shares. In other words, minority shareholders can be discriminated against and their shares can be acquired, without consent, by the majority shareholders/controllers at a price they deem fit. This is also known as a ‘squeeze-out’, albeit selective reduction of shares is only one of the means for achieving this. In fact, such a squeeze-out was the central plot of the movie The Social Network, where Mark Zuckerberg removed his co-founder from Facebook (now rebranded as ‘Meta’) by significantly diluting his shares through selective share reduction. This raises concerns of corporate governance as the controllers can, essentially, drive out minority shareholders if they deem it essential without prior appraisal or consent.\n\nIn this article, the authors begin with explaining the statutory scheme and jurisprudence of selective reduction of shares under the Indian law.  Later, they argue that the decision making vis-à-vis reduction of shares, whether selective or not, must not be regulated as it affects the autonomy of the controller/majority shareholders to take independent business decisions. The authors further argue that, alternatively, there is a mechanism of oppression and mismanagement that can be used to deal with such cases. Hence, the authors propose that the scope of judicial review for reduction of shares should be limited.\n\nStatutory Scheme\n\nSelective reduction of shares stems from Section 66 of the Companies Act 2013 (CA 2013). This provision must be read with the procedural requirements laid down in the National Company Law Tribunal (Procedure for Reduction of Share Capital of Company) Rules 2016. According to Section 66 of the CA 2013, there are, inter alia, five primary requirements that must be met in order to implement a selective reduction of shares:\n\nThe shareholders must pass a Special Resolution (i.e., the vote of at least 75% shareholders) in favour of such reduction of shares;\nThe company’s Articles of Association (AOA) must authorise such action;\nNone of the company’s creditors should have an issue with this decision;\nThe company must successfully seek the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for the same.\nReduction of shares cannot be carried out if “if the company is in arrears in the repayment of any deposits accepted by it.”\n\nSpecial attention must be paid to the language of Section 66(1) of the CA 2013 when it states that “a company [...] having a share capital may, by a special resolution, reduce the share capital in any manner.” A textual interpretation of this provision prima facie indicates that companies have the autonomy to carry out reduction of shares in whatever manner they deem fit for the purposes of carrying out their commercial activities. This level of autonomy seems to stem from the phrase “in any manner.” In this regard, the legislature has not specifically carved out any criteria, or legal thresholds. However, as explained in the next part, the courts have not done justice to the level of autonomy that has been given to companies by the legislature.\n\nIs the Scope of Judicial Scrutiny Justified?\n\nMore often than not, the decisions to be taken in a company in India are put to vote where the opinion of the majority is chosen per se. Here, despite clear statutory demarcations, the Indian courts have raised certain guidelines for objection where the company will not be allowed to move ahead with capital reduction. A landmark common law case, British and American Trustee and Finance Corporation Ltd. and Reduced v. John Couper, has stated that the issue of reduction of shares is a domestic concern, i.e., it is an internal matter of a company. However, the Indian judiciary does not seem to have followed this line of thought. For instance, in Reckitt Benckiser v. Unknown, the Supreme Court of India (SC) stated that “in order to determine whether a proposed selective reduction is unfair or discriminatory, two factors must be duly considered — a) The motive of the company behind the given extinguishment; and b) The fairness of the valuation of the shares.” Introducing aspects such as motive and fairness does not seem aligned with the legislative intent of the provision as derived from the textual interpretation of “in any manner” in Section 66 of the CA Act 2013.\n\nDissecting the first factor; the court reasoned that it was the responsibility of the court to protect the interest of the minority of the shareholders which are dissenting per se [Re. Denver Hotel Co.]. Thus, it was considered that it was the policy of the legislature that the majority should provide a justification for capital reduction and the manner in which it shall be carried out.\n\nOver time, the principle of ‘majority of the minority shareholders’ arose, where the courts stated that the reduction of shares will not be interfered unless minority shareholders support such a decision [Sandvik Asia Limited v. Bharat Kumar Padamsi; Organon (India) Limited v. Unknown]. This is akin to giving the minority shareholders a veto power over the decision making of the controllers, thereby seriously impacting the decision-making autonomy of the controllers/majority shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, the courts have also gone into the question of whether the valuation of the minority’s shareholding was ‘fair’ or not. In Re: Cadbury India Limited, the court appointed an independent valuer to check and/or establish a fair price. Issues have also arisen contending “oppressive” valuation of minorities’ shareholding in such arrangements [Bharti Telecom Limited v. Registrar Of Companies]. With this decision, it can be observed how erroneous this approach is as, in the absence of any express thresholds, the courts are delving into the ‘fairness’ of valuation, which is a highly subjective exercise. Additionally, these tribunals (both company law boards and NCLTs) have ignored the SC decision of Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union v. Hindustan Lever Limited, where the apex court stated that “[a] company court . . . is not required to interfere only because the figure arrived at by the valuer was not as better as it would have been if another method would have been adopted.”\n\nRecently, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has provided conflicting decisions on this topic. In Devinder Parkash Kalra v. Syngenta, the NCLAT ordered a fresh valuation as the “the minority shareholders had the right to expect best price for the shares they were being asked to forego.” However, the reason behind ordering a fresh valuation was a three-year delay and a corresponding change in the financial position of the company. Unlike the previous instances, this decision seems to be on a better footing as there was a valid rationale behind it and the same was not carried out to determine a ‘fair’ valuation. In another recent decision of Economy Hotels v. Registrar of Companies, the NCLAT categorically stated that a “‘[r]eduction of Capital’ is a ‘Domestic Affair’ of a particular company in which, ordinarily, a Tribunal will not interfere because of the reason that it is a ‘majority decision’ which prevails.” This decision seems to respect the internal workings of a company, especially vis-à-vis autonomy of the controllers to take independent business decisions.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nAs the previous parts of this article indicate, in the context of reduction of shares, the authors support the position that the independent business decision-making authority of the controllers should not be interfered with, or should only be interfered with to a very limited extent. A brief analogy can be drawn with the workings of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. In this regard, the author has previously argued that the “commercial wisdom” of the CoC must be respected vis-à-vis Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and should not be subjected to unnecessary checks as suggested by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India. Similarly, except for the procedural checks provided by the provision, the courts should not interfere with the controllers’ commercial decision-making, especially in the context of ‘fair’ valuation.\n\nAlternatively, minority shareholders can rather choose the route of Section 244 of the CA 2013. A company can be held liable for its oppressive or prejudicial acts. Oppression means lack of probity and fair dealing in the affairs of the company, prejudicing some members [Rajahmundary Electric Supply v. A Nageshwara Rao]. To constitute oppression, there must be a wrongful act, the conduct of which is mala fide and against good conduct [Shri V.S. Krishnan v. Westfort Hi-Tech Hospital]. Thus, if the controllers take the decision of conducting share reduction with a mala fide intention of removing a minority shareholder(s), or if the controllers set an unfair price ultimately prejudicing the minority shareholders, they can file a suit of oppression against the controllers.\n\nThis approach ensures that the controllers are in a position to take commercial business decisions in the context of share reductions without being affected, or interfered, by courts vis-à-vis treatment of minority shareholders. At the same time, the minority shareholders have an avenue for filing a suit against the company in case the controllers act, for instance, in a mala fide manner. This two-pronged approach effectively balances the two sides of the same coin: commercial decision-making autonomy and corporate governance.\n\n\nCompanies ActSharesReductionCorporate Governance\nCorporate Law\n763 views\n3 likes.

The SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015 (PIT Regulations) and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR Regulations) respectively criminalize and govern insider trading. Further, the PIT Regulations and the LODR Regulations aim to create information asymmetry by preventing insiders from taking unfair advantage over other shareholders and by maintaining “a level playing field in terms of access to material information between the insiders and market participants”.\n\nHowever, ambiguity in the implementation of the PIT Regulations and the LODR Regulations may lead to selective disclosure practices. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) fined Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and two of its compliance officers  for failure to undertake the prescribed legal recourse upon the selective disclosure of undisclosed price sensitive information (UPSI).\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the fine related to Facebook Inc.’s (Facebook) investment of INR 43,574 for a 9.9% stake in RIL’s wholly owned subsidiary, Jio Platforms Limited. Announcements on the stock exchanges were made by RIL on 22 April 2020. SEBI held that the violations were pursuant to the non-adherence to the disclosure norms with respect to the announcement by the RIL post the UPSI period of the investment. According to SEBI, the UPSI period of this particular investment began on 1 September 2019, when the initial discussion on a potential transaction with Facebook started, and the same ended on 24 March 2020, when the speculative report in the Financial Times, London was published. \n\nSEBI held that because of the publication of the news reports, UPSI had become selectively available and RIL was obligated to promptly provide clarifications on its own accord. RIL denied these allegations and stated that although the UPSI period rightly began on 1 September 2019, it only ended on 21 April 2020, when the binding agreement between RIL and Facebook was signed, and the corporate announcements were made by the companies on the respective stock exchanges. For this, reliance was placed on Principle 1 of Schedule A of the PIT Regulations which requires the disclosure of the information “no sooner than credible and concrete information comes into being”. \n\nReviewing the Availability of ‘Concrete And Credible’ Information\n\nIt was the stance of RIL that since the parties were yet to agree on the final valuation and value of the investment by Facebook, and there was no binding agreement in place as on 24 March 2020, there was no ‘concrete and credible’ information available on the matter which would obligate RIL to make disclosures. \n\nHowever, it may be noted that what is ‘concrete and credible’ has not been defined by the PIT Regulations. Further, upon a review of the SEBI’s earlier orders, it becomes apparent that SEBI has mandated disclosures at different stages. In the adjudication order in the matter of Bank of Rajasthan, it was held that the information in concern had become ‘concrete’ on the signing of the binding agreement which had to be disclosed regardless of the future consequences. The order even provided the instance of an ideal disclosure by TATA Chemicals which made a public announcement of acquiring a 100% stake in British Salt after the signing of a binding agreement. \n\nGiven that it is the responsibility of the entity to prove that they made the right disclosures at the right time, this lacuna of a bright-line test to determine the end of the UPSI period creates a a double whammy. On the one hand, as in the RIL’s case, delay in disclosure of UPSI leads to the violation of the PIT Regulations, and on the other hand, a premature disclosure may amount to inducement and invite penalties under Regulation 4(2)(f) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations 2003. Regulation 4(2)(f) prohibits the disclosure of information which is not true, or not believed to be true – at the pre-dealing stages.  \n\nDid the Information Require Disclosure? \n\nAnother line of defense which, although was not adopted by RIL, is whether the information had the characteristic of UPSI in order to trigger RIL’s disclosure obligations. Any information must comprise three essential ingredients, to be characterized as UPSI. First, the information should be directly or indirectly related to a company or its securities. Second, such information should not be generally available. Third, upon becoming generally available, the information must materially affect the price of the securities. Therefore, one of the ingredients of UPSI is that it is not ‘generally available’ i.e., it is “not accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory basis”.[1]\n\nIn the case of Hindustan Lever Limited v. Securities and Exchange Board of India,[2] where there was a merger of two companies and it was to be determined whether there was insider trading on the basis of UPSI under the SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulations 1992, it was held that where there were a “large number of press reports indicating market speculation on the merger during that period”, then although the information “was not formally acknowledged or published, [it] was in one sense generally known.” In other words, disclosure on behalf of the company was not required where UPSI had become generally available due to its wide reporting. \n\nSimilarly, in the present circumstance where UPSI had become generally available through the wide dissemination on news platforms, RIL could contend that formal acknowledgment via disclosure was not necessary. \n\nConclusion \n\nLaw should be available in a clear, specific, and predictable manner for a just and transparent regulatory system. While there are a host of factors that determine the existence of UPSI, the importance of having an objective test to determine the appropriate stage of the disclosure cannot be undermined. In the absence of correct guidance, companies may face difficulties in managing their affairs and be subject to needless prosecution and hefty fines. This is compounded by the fact that there is little judicial adherence – as the orders passed by the SEBI only have a persuasive value and not precedential value. \n\nIn RIL’s case, one may cull out multiple adjudicatory inconsistencies with potential to cause uncertainty. Companies may be unable to determine the appropriate time to make the mandated disclosures, despite wishing to comply in earnest with the PIT Regulations, among other requirements of the SEBI framework. As the first step, it is recommended that SEBI proactively fill the lacunae in the law through its orders, circulars, FAQs, or informal guidance.\n[1] Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 2015, Gazette of India, pt.

        "content": "Amar Gupta\nOct 2, 2022\n4 min read\nThe Polyvocal Court\n[Amar is a Partner at JSA. The following article was first published on Lexology.]\n\nThe scope of power of the Adjudicating Authority, the National Company Law Tribunal (Tribunal), dealing with an application of a financial creditor under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code) is once again under discussion. One would have thought that the issue had been settled by the Supreme Court’s decision in Innoventive Industries Limited v. ICICI Bank (Innoventive), followed by its decision in E.S. Krishnamurthy v. Bharath Hi-Tecch Builders (Private) Limited (Bharath Hi-Tecch). However, the ‘polyvocal’ court that our Supreme Court is, there is always a possibility of different judicial view of another bench.\n\nIn Innoventive, the Supreme Court held that when an application for initiation of insolvency resolution process is brought before the Tribunal, it must decide the question of existence of default in payment of financial debt on the basis of the records of information utility or the evidence furnished by the financial creditor within 15 days. The court then ruled that “the moment the adjudicating authority is satisfied that a default has occurred, the application must be admitted” unless it is incomplete, in which case, an opportunity is required to be given to the applicant to rectify the deficiency. In case the default is established, the ruling in Innoventive leaves no discretion to the Tribunal to follow any other course except to admit the petition. If there was still any doubt regarding the power of the Tribunal, the court made it clear that “it is of no matter that the debt is disputed so long as the debt is “due” i.e. payable unless interdicted by some law or has not yet become due in the sense that it is payable at some future date. It is only when this is proved to the satisfaction of the adjudicating authority that the adjudicating authority may reject an application and not otherwise”.\n\nIn Bharath Hi-Tecch, the Supreme Court once again examined the scope of enquiry under Section 7 upon a petition by a financial creditor and concluded, “thus, two courses of action are available to the adjudicating authority in a petition under Section 7. The adjudicating authority must either admit the application under clause (a) of sub-section (5) or it must reject the application under clause (b) of sub-section (5). The statute does not provide for the adjudicating authority to undertake any other action, but for the two choices available.” The court affirmed the decision in Innoventive and counselled the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) about the limits of their powers as “creatures of the statute”.\n\nThese decisions held the field until the recent decision of Supreme Court in Vidarbha Industries Power Limited v. Axis Bank Limited (Vidarbha Industries).\n\nIn Vidarbha Industries, the court completely reversed the earlier position. It held that while considering an application by a financial creditor under Section 7(5) of the Code, the Tribunal may “examine the expedience of initiation of CIRP, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, including the overall financial health and viability of the Corporate Debtor. The Adjudicating Authority may in its discretion not admit the application of a Financial Creditor.” The court noted the use of the word 'may' instead of 'shall' in Section 7(5) and for that reason held that in case of financial debt, the statute allows “flexibility”, and it has conferred the discretion on the Tribunal even if the default in payment is established. If facts and circumstances so warrant, the Tribunal can keep the admission in abeyance or even reject the application.\n\nThe judgment in Vidarbha Industries arguably adopts more pragmatic approach to insolvency and seeks to provide respite to companies who may have defaulted due to temporary financial distress but are otherwise solvent and viable. It does make economic sense to not push such companies into insolvency following the rigid rule in Innoventive. \n\nThe judgment, however, is not a good example of judicial law making.\n\nLegal stability and predictability are fundamental to rule of law. Predictability of legal outcome (particularly in case of economic legislation) enables citizens and businesses to arrange their affairs based on past judicial precedents without fear of disruption on account of judicial decision. To achieve these ends, our courts adhere to the doctrine of stare de­cisis and follow previous decision on the same issue.\n\nThe adherence to precedents, however, is not an “inexorable command”. There may be good reasons to overrule or dissent from a previous decision. However, the doctrine of stare decisis requires that, while doing so, the court must engage with the precedent in question and give it careful consideration. I submit that the court failed to do that in its ruling in Vidarbha Industries which reverses the position upheld in Innoventive and Bharath Hi-Tecch. It referred to the Innoventive for expounding on the object and purpose of the Code but totally overlooked the part of the judgment which specifically dealt with the issue at hand. As for Bharath Hi-Tecch, the court did not even refer to the same.\n\nArguably, the court had good reasons for the ruling it made in Vidarbha Industries; however, it ought to have explained its departure from the earlier position upheld in the previous decisions. It is possible that those decisions (or their relevant parts) were not brought to the notice of the court. However, one would expect more rigorous and thorough judicial determination from the apex court, the law declared by which is binding on all courts and citizens.\nVidarbhaInsolvencyIBCInnoventive\nInsolvency Law\n135 views\n1 like.

The following article was published on The Pioneer and Lexology.]\n\nAmid limited healthcare infra, resources must serve Indians.\n\nThe ‘Heal in India’ initiative may have several positives, but being alert on risks is even more important. Cognizance of the impact on the overall approach towards the Indian healthcare model is crucial. While there have been several ‘hits’, the ‘Heal in India’ initiative cuts across the misses that need to be looked at.\n\nAffordability and accessibility are the two key issues in the healthcare sector in India. Almost 2.1% of the GDP is committed to affordability, which is staggering low as compared with the 9.7% in OECD countries. Moreover, more than 50% of healthcare expenses in India are borne by citizens, pushing 55 million poverty-stricken people further down the abyss.\n\nAlmost 28% of the urban population has access to 66% of the beds in hospitals, while the remaining 72% has access to only 33% of hospital beds. In the case of the medical fraternity, 67% of doctors are in the cities.\n\nIndia has two successful models in the West for valuable lessons. One is the insurance-based model in the US and another is the UK’s state-controlled National Health Service (NHS) model.\n\nThe government is doing all to build the medical education base with new colleges, healthcare plans and reforms for a higher output of medical talent. However, this requires a multiplicity of regulatory checks, where merely the cheque-and-fee model should not be the deciding factor.\n\nWhile Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and ‘Heal in India’ initiatives aim to streamline the integrated digital health infrastructure, the ever-increasing healthcare needs of the neglected masses are overlooked. For instance, while the innovative thought of building an online repository of healthcare professionals will enable foreign patients to access the best-suited treatment line, this in no way ensures affordable healthcare for their own citizens. Since COVID-19 brought the world to its knees, nations have supported one another with life-saving vaccinations and medical kits. However, the fine line between the import/ export of products and healthcare professionals may have been ignored and taken for granted. The General Agreement on Trade in Services in the 1990s also aimed to create a liberal healthcare world, and the results were criticized globally. A similar impact is caused by an overdose of medical tourism. When a country’s limited healthcare resources are exploited or, more precisely, stretched to the utmost to serve the healthcare needs of stakeholders other than its own citizens, it makes a massive dent in the country’s health equity.\n\nIndia neither has a strong supply side nor a weak demand base that would benefit from such a repository. Instead, a registry is required at the national, urban, and rural levels to address the mounting healthcare challenges, which are manpower, access, affordability, etc. Such a registry along with strong public healthcare initiatives is the urgent need for India’s current healthcare sector. The online National Health Resource Repository being planned and built robustly by the National Health Authority will require healthcare professionals to upload their professional details and achievements along with their preferred destinations. This will give foreigners a ready list of hospitals available for the most appropriate healthcare services. About 42 allied healthcare services that have been on offer via this portal have been identified, offering professionals access to serve foreign patients in the country of their choice.\n\nIt is time to prioritize our nation’s healthcare needs and move in the right direction for ‘Heal in India’ first and then ‘Heal by India’.\nHealthcareHeal in India\nLaw and Policy\n87 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Tokenization and Securitization – A Comparison with Reference to SARFAESI Act",
        "content": "Mukund Arora, Keerti Nair\nOct 1, 2022\n5 min read\nTokenization and Securitization – A Comparison with Reference to SARFAESI Act\n[Mukund and Keerti are students at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.]\n\nSecuritization is the backbone of complex financial engineering, facilitating the biggest capital markets comprising bonds, debentures, and over-the-counter derivatives by volume. Further, the adoption of decentralized finance and blockchain technology has already resulted in the creation of unique asset classes, redefining finance globally. By July 2022, the cryptocurrency derivatives reached a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion, demonstrating the changing landscape of financial markets. In view of the above, this post will be limited to 2 use-case assets of securitization that are viably being replaced by tokenization in practice – debt/credit/equity instruments, and infrastructure assets. This post seeks to explore critiques on securitization considering tokenization, and how tokenization can be accommodated under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002 (SARFAESI Act). \n\nSECURITIZATION AND TOKENIZATION\n\nSecuritization is the process through which certain types of assets are pooled so that they can be repackaged into interest-bearing securities. Securitization de-links the credit risk of assets from the credit risk of the originators, and creates liquidity from illiquid assets, by converting these assets into layered securities. ‘Securitization’ is defined under Section 2(1)(z) of the SARFAESI Act as the “acquisition of financial assets by any asset reconstruction company from any originator, whether by raising of funds by such asset reconstruction company from qualified buyers by issue of security receipts representing undivided interest in such financial assets or otherwise.”\n\nTokenization is principled on similar lines, except that the procedure is technology intensive. The tokenization of real assets or debt/equity instruments reduces transaction costs through disintermediation and automation. Further, tokenization enhances transparency and reduces size and liquidity requirements due to lower transaction costs. It is an expansion of blockchain technology that allows digital assets to be bought, sold, and traded on blockchains. The primary difference is that while tokenization turns all real-world assets into high-liquidity digital tokens, securitization converts low-liquidity assets into higher-liquidity security instruments which are traded in markets and over-the-counter platforms. \n\nSECURITIZATION: CRITICISMS AND COMPARISON\n\nSecuritization inherently structures financial products that rely on regular dividend payments. However, protracted settlement timelines and manual processes slow down the issuance process. Tokenization allows debt issuers to and address these inefficiencies through automation, transparency, and immutability. Securitization is a complex process and includes various actors such as the original lender, the originator, the sponsor, the special purpose entity (issuer), the underwriter, the credit rating agencies, the third-party credit enhancers, the swap counterparty, the servicer, the trustee, and the investors. Middlemen compound the problem by charging significant fees for these services. However, these entities do not exist in a tokenization procedure. \n\nFirst, tokenization typically focuses on specific assets rather than diverse asset portfolios. Due to this limited scope, tokenization occurs outside of the non-linear pay-out relationships of asset-backed securities. \n\nConfidential financial information such as asset ownership details, lease information, payment-related information, revenue-sharing confirmation, transaction tracking, and digital wallet account verification are included and transparent on the blockchain. Tokenization offers both access to investments and the knowledge required to make investment decisions by bringing communities of specialists together via the blockchain and rewarding the same through tokens.\n\nSecuritization is most frequently used in the context of loans and assets that produce receivables, such as various consumer debt or commercial debt. Bonds that have been securitized also often lack transparency since asset-specific details remain undisclosed. There remains a high degree of information asymmetry as investors are not given access to such information by issuer. Securitized bond expenses are likewise significantly more expensive. In terms of process, securitization is far more difficult to manage because it includes numerous parties and carries a risk of default. On the other hand, tokenization is relatively more transparent as blockchains are immutable and accessible to anyone. Subject to the mode of credit risk assessment, the determination of default probability may be more constructive under tokenization.\n APPLICABILITY UNDER THE SARFAESI ACT\n\nThe main objects of the SARFAESI Act are to “..to govern securitization and reconstruction of financial assets, as well as the enforcement of security interests, and to provide for a centralized database of security interests formed on property rights, and for issues associated with or incidental thereto.” The primary intent behind this legislation was to allow banks and other financial institutions to recover payments on non-performing assets delays without court intervention. Further, the SARFAESI Act is applicable to, among others, financial institutions, insurance companies, banks, state financial corporations, state industrial development corporations, and asset-reconstruction companies (ARCs). \n\nHowever, tokenization protocols allow anyone to tokenize their assets or credit risk and trade it on a blockchain. The tokenization process is not regulated under the SARFAESI Act. Therefore, to include tokenization within the ambit of the SARFAESI Act would require a significant change to scope and applicability provisions. \n\nThe SARFAESI Act pertains to the regulation of securitization and reconstruction of financial assets of banks and financial institutions. The SARFAESI Act mandates the registration of ARCs, prior to commencement of any business relating to securitization or reconstruction. It may be noted that while securitization and reconstruction are governed by statute, higher regulatory requirements may make the securitization process more regulation lengthier and unattractive. Tokenization, on the other hand, does not at present require  special statutory permissions for asset trading. Asset tokenization consists of creating an informatic code presenting the key characteristics of the asset while exposing some functions allowing the user to interact with the digital representation of the asset. From a technical standpoint, this process can be broken down into 4 key steps: \n\n(a)  selection of the model for representing assets;\n(b)   modeling of the asset; \n(c)   technical and security review of the informatic code; and \n(d)  deployment of the informatic code. \n\nAs far as enforcing security interests, and seizing the assets pledged as collateral for the loan is concerned, the tokenization procedure is typically replicated via smart contract functions and automation through blockchain. In this essence, a blockchain can function with the set provisions of the SARFAESI Act and be modified to enforce security interests in specific circumstances. This would require close interaction between the said public blockchain and applicable provisions of the SARFAESI Act, along with other applicable laws. This is possible since smart contracts can be encoded according to prevailing legislations, and perform functions as specified. The above may be achieved through amendments to the SARFAESI Act, or the introduction of a specific legislation (thus making the SARFAESI Act supplemental or separate). \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTokenization is a natural step in the evolution of securitization. It provides liquidity to asset classes that were previously untradeable. As a result, tokenization can greatly improve participation and information efficiency/symmetry in financial markets. It may be argued therefore, that tokenization is poised to transform the securitization landscape and can greatly democratize market participation while ensuring fairness and security.\nSARFAESI ActSecuritizationSecurities MarketTokenization\nCorporate Law\n226 views\n12 likes.

        "content": "Dev Agrawal\nSep 29, 2022\n6 min read\nPress Note 3 (2020): Deconstructing Foreign Investment By Bordering Countries\n[Dev is a student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat.]\n\nThe private equity (PE) industry has contributed to nation building through investments that have helped Indian businesses to become better, both in size as well as in quality. 2021 was been one of the best years for the PE and venture capital (VC) industry with a post-pandemic overhaul in of investments worth $77.1 billion in India. With over 2000 deals, the value of which has tripled since 2016, there were 11 investments of more than $1 billion and alternative investment funds (AIFs) contributed $11.2 billion in investments[1]. There has been a growing trend of investments into consumer tech and alternative formats of commerce such as video commerce, direct to consumer brand aggregators and short-form videos. There has been an increasing shift towards ‘control’ deals by the PE/VC industry – with PE/VC funds showing growing enthusiasm for the growth of Indian assets by being part of key-decision making to foster profitability. \n\nAs of May 2022, more than $24 billion in PE/VC investments were seen across 630 deals. There has been a lot of early-stage deals, in total crossing $500 million in NFT marketplaces, and areas associated with cryptocurrency trading platforms. An emerging trend across 2021 was several employee stock option (ESOP) liquidity events with more than 30 start-up companies announcing ESOP buyback schemes, which has been encouraging for the Indian workforce. Notably, PE/VC investors have placed a prime focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment strategies and are viewing ESG practices as essential elements of value creation and as a key theme to drive value across the full investing value chain. PE/VC funds are increasingly adopting ESG-related goals by embedding such practices through the investment lifecycle.\n\nPress Note 3 of 2020: Concerns and Way Forward\n\nPress Note 3 of 2020 dated 17 April 2020 (PN 3) provides that “an entity of a country, which shares a land boundary with India or the beneficial owner of an investment into India who is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can only invest under the government route”. \n\nDefining 'Beneficial Ownership'\n\nAt the current juncture, the expression 'beneficial ownership' has not been clearly defined. The lack of a clear definition has created uncertainty for investors as the phrase 'beneficial ownership' is understood in differing ways across India’s present regulatory landscape. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s KYC directions, as well as the Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005, 'beneficial ownership' has been pegged to a threshold of 25%. Similarly, under the Ministry of Finance’s General Financial Rules (GFRs) in relation to restrictions concerning public procurement from land-bordering countries, 'beneficial ownership' is defined as “ownership of, or entitlement to, more than twenty five percent of shares or capital or profits of the company”. \n\nOn the other hand, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)’s Standard Operating Procedure in relation to the filing and examination of FDI approval applications refers to the threshold set under the Companies Act 2013, which in turn prescribes a threshold of 10% for the determination of significant beneficial ownership. A fixed threshold for determination of 'beneficial ownership' would greatly benefit investors and clear the current anomaly, where divergent positions are taken by different agencies. This is especially important in the context of PE/VC players, which are essentially vehicles to pool investment from various small investors (i.e., LPs) who do not have any ability to control or direct the operations of the PE fund.\n\nGoing forward, as long as beneficial ownership of such PE/VC funds held by investors in land-bordering countries is below 25%, a framework may be considered where investments by such PE/VC funds are allowed under the automatic route, basis a declaration from the fund that its GP/ Manager is not in a land-bordering country and that the control of the fund is not held by an investor in a land-bordering country. In fact, this approach would also be in line with the ownership-control test under the present guidelines governing foreign direct investment.\n\nPendency of Applications and Delays in Approval Process \n\nWe understand through media reports from June 2022, basis an RTI application, that only 80 out of 382 proposals submitted by investors from land-bordering countries have received government approval, and investments worth billions of dollars remain stick in the pipeline. Currently, the approval process under PN 3 entails long delays on account of applications being considered and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. To promote ease of doing business, the regulatory framework should stipulate a clearly defined process which could be under the aegis of the DPIIT, and set out an expedited timeframe for processing of approval applications for PN 3 in the same manner as is provided for other approval applications. \n\nTo further simplify the process, specific parameters should be provided for the evaluation of applications. For instance, the applicant’s past investment profile, the nationality and credibility of the directors, sensitivity of the specific sector into which investment is being made and whether the applicant is proposing to enter into ‘control deals’ could be considered while assessing proposals from a PN 3 standpoint. It is also observed that different ministries of the government have adopted different approaches in respect to approval applications. In order to ensure that no specific sectors are unfairly impacted on account of such different approaches, it would be beneficial for the DPIIT to spearhead the process of alignment and coordination among the Ministries and officials to further streamline the approval process. \n\nImplications of PN 3 on Downstream Investment\n\nCurrently, the applicability of PN 3 in respect of downstream investment by foreign owned and controlled companies (FOCCs) is unclear, and the government has not provided guidance on the relevant threshold to be considered for requirement of approval for downstream investment. Notably, at present, portfolio companies (whether FOOC or Indian owned and controlled) that may have minority investments from investors in land-bordering countries are required to seek approval for downstream investment under PN 3, due to lack of regulatory clarity. In order to encourage investment and facilitate ease of doing business, the government should consider an approach: where approval under PN 3 should not be required in cases where aggregate beneficial ownership held by investors in land-bordering countries is within the permissible threshold of 25%, unless the investor from a land-bordering country has actual control. \n\nAdditionally, in cases where investment has been received by an Indian entity pursuant to a PN 3 approval from the government, downstream investment in other Indian investee companies, under the automatic route, should not be subject to a fresh PN 3 approval requirement. Given that fund infusion in India have been made a requirement for a fresh approval is an unnecessary hardship for investors. As such downstream investment, after scrutiny of the investor’s profile by the government and after receipt of government approval, it would not entail any fresh infusion of funds into India by investors in land-bordering countries – the requirement of a further PN 3 approval should be done away with at the stage of such entities making further downstream investment in other Indian entities. \n\nForeign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in Listed Companies\n\nBasis detailed consideration, the policy pronouncements were made by the government wherein it was announced that investment by a non-resident in a listed company for a stake below 10% shall be regarded as a foreign portfolio investment (FPI). However, when the entire gamut of exchange control regulations and FDI policy are viewed in depth, it is clear that the enabling framework in relation to the FPI route, as set out under the Foreign Portfolio Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules 2019 (NDI Rules) is only prescribed for foreign portfolio investors that are registered with SEBI, and not for non-residents in general who hold less than 10% in a listed entity. Consequently, even investors (who are not registered as foreign portfolio investors with SEBI) with sub 10% investments are required to ensure compliance with the various FDI related norms and sectoral conditionalities. \n\nIn order to give full effect to the government’s vision in relation to the liberalisation of this policy, the scope of the enabling framework under NDI Rules should be enlarged to cover non-residents in general (i.e., investors who are not SEBI registered foreign portfolio investors) so that they can invest via the FPI route. Thus, given that such non-residents would have their demat account in India, their KYC would already have been undertaken. This approach would go a long way in fostering investment in listed companies as non-residents would be able to make investment without the requirement to comply with sectoral caps and conditionalities that are provided under the FDI policy in so far as passive investments (sub 10%) are concerned.\n[1] Sources: India Private Equity Report 2022, Bain & Company, 16 June 2022; India Venture Capital Report 2022, Bain & Company, 30 March 2022; IVCA-EY; PE/VC Agenda- India Trend Book 2022, March 2022.\nCorporateCompanies ActPress NoteFPIVC\nCorporate Law\n3,068 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Analyzing the Proposed Regulatory Framework for OBTPs: A Necessary Step by SEBI?",
        "content": "Yajush Tripathi\nSep 26, 2022\n5 min read\nAnalyzing the Proposed Regulatory Framework for OBTPs: A Necessary Step by SEBI?\n[Yajush is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe latest proposal by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to establish a regulatory framework for the regulation of online bond trading platforms (OBTPs) was a needed measure. Implementation of this regulatory framework, in all probability, will rule out the majority of concerns highlighted by the consultation paper dated 21 July 2022 passed by SEBI, which also enlists the regulatory measures regarding the OBTPs in a detailed manner. \n\nSEBI came up with these regulations to protect the investor’s interests, specifically to ensure that the confidence of non-institutional or retail investors remains intact. Moreover, to alleviate the fear of the investors that the OBTPs, i.e., fintech companies such as Goldenpi, might misappropriate their investment. \n\nRetail investors’ investment in debt securities or bonds is scanty through the electronic bond platforms. Therefore, OBTPs were brought about, which connect the buyers and sellers, i.e., act as intermediaries for trading purposes. So, to ensure that the investment from such non-institutional investors persists and to crank it up a notch higher efficiently and correctly and for other related aspects, a kind of regulatory mechanism was needed for the smooth functioning of OBTPs. SEBI proposed a regulatory framework to suffice this purpose through this consultation order.\n\nAnalysis of the Regulations\n\nThese regulatory steps seem stringent prima facie, and rightfully so, as, to effectively ensure the above objectives, these regulatory measures need to be stern and nuanced. The step of registering these bond platforms as stock brokers with SEBI and an alternative to it, i.e. authorising SEBI-registered brokers to run the OBTPs, seems the most pragmatic regulatory step. It is so, as this step ensures transparency as to in which debt securities the retail investors invest and in what manner. Furthermore, this would also ensure that the functioning of the OBTPs is free of encumbrances and hardships. The effectuation of this step would be plausible, all the even more, attributable to SEBI's code of conduct for such stockbrokers, within which these OBTPs would now deem to fall. Adherence to the code of conduct would ensure the smooth functioning of OBTPs.\n\nAnother step of locking in for six months the debt securities issued on a private-placement basis and offered for sale on OBTPs, was also necessary since it attempted to address the issue of non-compliance with Section 25(2) of the Companies Act 2013. SEBI essentially brought about this regulatory step to ensure that there is no buying/selling of debt securities interminably.  Moreover, if the current regime continues to persist, then as per the existing framework, the purpose of OTBPs of selling the debt securities to investors on a private placement basis would lose its significance. Eventually, the whole current mechanism of OTBPs would deem to be a public issue.\n\nIn addition, the mandate of SEBI to make all transactions go through the route of the Debt segment's trading platform or the exchanges' RFQ platform is a step which can mitigate the possibility of wrongful transactions. The route of trading them through the trading platform of the debt segment of stock exchanges seems reasonable as it would diminish the settlement risk in accordance with the functioning of stock exchanges. Further, it would give settlements on a ‘T+2’ basis (‘trade date plus two days’ basis) which indicates that the monetary transactions regarding selling and buying of a security shall be settled within two days after the completion of the trade. The ‘T+2’ basis is a standard practice in India for settling trades in stock exchanges. As an alternative to the above route method, SEBI also proposed the route ‘request for quote’ (RFQ) platform of the stock exchanges on a delivery versus payment basis for the transactions done through the OBTPs, which works on the principle of payment for shares by the investors only after the deliverance of it. This step also seems to improve the existing framework as this step, like the above, would not mandate the OBTPs to do away with their current interface and, at the same time, will, in all probability, settle the transactions in a manner conducive to investors. This clears the air on whether the transactions shall be effectuated through cash on a delivery or delivery versus payment basis.\n\nApart from these regulatory steps, the consultation paper also states that only listed debt securities shall be offered by the OBTPs to be bought/sold. SEBI essentially did this to decrease the confusion investors bore regarding the nature of the debt securities whilst purchasing the same. Though per the current regime, the bond platforms themselves mention the listing status of the debt security. Still, for the sake of clarity and brevity for the investors, it was deemed necessary that the selling/buying of both listed and unlisted debt securities be done separately to avoid any iota of confusion. The same has been stated through this clarification by the SEBI.\n\nA Needed Step or a Premature Step by SEBI?\n\nA proposed regulatory framework by SEBI on OBTPs through a consultation paper dated 21 July 2022 can be termed as a ‘needed step’ and not a premature step attributable to all the reasons enlisted by SEBI in the consultation paper itself and owing to the growth trajectory of the OBTPs since its inception.\n\nIn observance of the functioning and growth of OBTPs, i.e., Goldenpi, BondsIndia, and Bondskart, it is palpable that the number of investors buying the debt securities through these platforms has increased exponentially and is continuing to increase because herein, the investors get increased interest returns compared to fixed deposits’ dwindling returns. Owing to these developments, the investors are deemed more susceptible to misappropriation at the hands of the fintech companies as mentioned above. Thus, to prevent any harm to investors and maintain the sanctity of the securities market, a regulatory framework was needed immediately owing to investors’ flourished usage of OBTPs.\n\nSo, it cannot be termed a premature step, as the basis of the proposed regulatory framework is solid and astute. This also can be said based on the reasoning that the size, stature, flow and significance of the OBTPs for non-institutional buyers or retail investors have become equivalent to the online system of stock exchanges and depositories, and as this system has a regulatory framework, the same shall be the case for OBTPs on an immediate basis (else, there can be dire consequences, especially for investors).\n\nConclusion\n\nThus, the reasonable conclusion of the foregoing discussion is that the consultation paper on OBTPs- Proposed regulatory framework dated 21 July 2022 was a much-needed step. SEBI carrying this out seemingly would resolve many concerns that are there in the functioning of OBTPs and also could, in turn, spruce up the possibility of augmentation of market making. \n\nImplementing these steps is subject to public comments that the SEBI has sought through the release of the consultation paper. It seems that the investors or the potential investors would not oppose these regulatory steps, and the only friction it will face would come from the OBTPs, i.e., fintech companies, as they would have to comply with the new regulations. Now, it is on SEBI, based on public comments, to firmly adjudge how this regulatory framework pans out for investors and the fintech companies.\nOnline Bond Trading PlatformsSEBI ActSEBIConsultation Paper\nCorporate Law\n131 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Patil Automation v. Rakheja Engineers: An End to Pre-Institution Mediation Conundrum",
        "content": "Deborshi Sarkar, Tarun Rajput\nSep 22, 2022\n7 min read\nPatil Automation v. Rakheja Engineers: An End to Pre-Institution Mediation Conundrum\n[Deborshi and Tarun are students at Symbiosis Law School, Noida.]\n\nThe jurisdiction of commercial courts in India as postulated under Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 (Act), extends to any and all commercial disputes arising out of states in India to which the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial courts extend. The specified value of such courts has been enumerated under Section 12 and the subject matter jurisdiction has been discussed in Section 2(1)(c). In order to minimize the burden of the existing commercial courts, the legislature by virtue of the 2018 amendment, enacted section 12A. Section 12A of the Act mandates mediation for any commercial dispute arising under the Act, barring the institution of a suit for the same unless an urgent interim relief is claimed. The conundrum existed around interpreting the mandatory nature of the provision which previously had been declared directory in a number of rulings by various High Courts. Recently, the Apex Court in M/s Patil Automation Private Limited and Others v. Rakheja Industries Private Limited has put an end to this conundrum by upholding the mandatory nature of mediation and thereby obliging parties to firstly restore to the an alternate form of dispute resolution before directly approaching the courts. The author through this article aims at analyzing some of the pertinent questions of law attached with mediation as a compulsory form of dispute resolution. \n\nPrevious High Court Rulings\n\nIn Deepak Raheja v. Ganga Taro Vairani [2021 SCC OnLine Bom 3124], the division bench of the Bombay High Court observed Section 12A of the Act to be mandatory in cases where no urgent relief is pursued. Further, the court construed the provision to be in furtherance of speedy disposal of commercial cases and recanted any liberal interpretation of the same in order to declare mediation directory. The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Laxmi Polyfab Private Limited v. Eden Reality Ventures Private Limited and Another [AIR 2021 Calcutta 190] discussed Section 12A of the Act and held that section 12A is mandatary in nature. The very same learned single judge in Dredging and Desiltation Company Private Limited v. Mackintosh Burn and Northern Consortium and Others [2021 SCC Online Calcutta 1458] also upheld the mandatory nature of the provision and stated that Section 12A is absolute. However, notwithstanding the above-mentioned judgment(s), a contrary view  was taken by the Hon’ble Madras High Court in Shahi Exports Private Limited v. Goldstar Line Limited and Others. The court in this case explored the constitutional aspect and stated that mandating mediation would deprive the parties of their right to approach courts thereby violating their constitutional right of access to justice. After harmoniously construing Section 12A along with Rule 3(1) of the Commercial Courts (Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules 2018 (Commercial Courts Rules), the High Court stated that parties could not be deprived of their right to approach courts directly. \n\nDetermining the Mandatary Nature of Section 12A\n\nAlthough a strict interpretation of the term ‘shall’ was adequate for the determination of a mandate, the Apex Court decided to emphasize on the sublime objective of the 2018 amendment  in order to interpret the use of ‘shall’ (paragraph 53). The Apex Court observed that legislature had brought this amendment to majorly decongest and de-clog the commercial courts which was imperative to enhance the ease of doing business in India. By attending the cases which required urgent interim relief, the provision acts as a successful deterrent towards docket explosion of commercial cases in India. The same purpose has been fulfilled by bringing down the specified value of commercial suits from one crore to three lakhs. Drawing inference from Sharif-ud-Din v. Abdul Gani Lone [(1980) 1 SCC 403], the Apex Court asserted that as non-compliance with Section 12A would result in defeating the object, the same has to be construed to be mandatory (paragraph 43). The court refrained from construing Section 12A as a mere procedural law as the same would be in blatant contravention to the mandatory flavor the parliament wanted to implement. \n\nImpediment to Access to Justice\n\nIt has been vehemently argued that mandating mediation would result in a blatant infringement to the parties’ right to approach courts and would thereby infringe one’s constitutional right of access to justice. Nonetheless, the Apex Court has now clarified that parties do not have a fundamental right to file of a civil suit (paragraph 55). The rationale for the same distinctly finds its roots in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (CPC). By virtue of Section 9 of CPC, the cognizance of civil suits can by express or necessary implications be barred. Further, Order VII, Rule 11(d) of CPC, gives courts the suo moto powers to reject a plaint where a statement in the same is barred by any law similar to a bar under Section 12A; thereby, every plaint does not necessarily result in an instituted suit. The very presence of these provision is indicative of the principle that there is no constitutional right to file a civil suit. The Apex Court pointed out that the legislature has carefully vouch-safed immediate access to courts for parties in a suit for urgent interim relief. The same has also been weaved in the text of Section 12A (paragraph 54). Carving out a class of suit and allowing them to obtain immediate relief forms a rational nexus with the objective of speedy justice the provision wanted to uphold. It is due time now that mandatory mediation is perceived to be in furtherance of access to justice. The intention behind the provision is to facilitate speedy disposal of cases. It can be construed as a respite given to parties to escape the clutches of adversarial litigation and achieve an amicable settlement. \n\nRight of Suo-Moto Rejection of Plaints\n\nDrawing inference from the judgment of the Hon’ble High Court of Madras in Olympic Cards Limited v. Standard Chartered Bank [(2013) 1 CTC 38], the Apex Court drew an analogy between presentation of a plaint and institution of a suit. The Hon’ble High Court in this case asserted that mere presentation of suit does not in itself result in institution of the same (paragraph 71). Once a plaint is introduced, the same is given a diary number, registered and then entered into the suit register. It is only after the entry into the suit register can a plaint be considered to have been validly instituted. All steps prior to this registration are preliminary in nature. Once a suit has been registered the same is presumed to be in conformity with Order IV Rule 1 of CPC or that the same is in compliance with Order VI and VII CPC. Further, Order VII Rule 13(d) of CPC postulates the rejection of a plaint if the same is barred by any law. A summon to the defendant can only be issued post the valid institution of suit (paragraph 70). The Apex Court drew this analogy with the sole purpose of pointing out the fact that rejecting a plaint prior to institution of the same would procedurally save courts a lot of time as there would not be a requirement to look into whether the suit complies all due requirements for institution. Further, institution of a suit opens up the scope for adjournment, objections and hearings. Suo moto rejection of the plaint for compliance with Section 12A would actually uphold the objecting of the legislature. Further, the Apex Court also pointed out that post institution of a suit, the same may still be rejected by an application being filed by the defendant under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC (paragraph 67). The same has been upheld by the Apex Court in Patasibai and Others v. Ratanlal [(1990) 2 SCC 42], where it was held that, “the mere issuance of summons by the trial court does not require that the trial should proceed even when no triable issue is shown to arise.” Therefore, any possibility of a temporary suspension of a suit subsequent to the issuance of summons under Order V, Rule 1 of CPC, for subsequent compliance of mediation proceedings has been ruled out. \n\nHarmonious Interpretation with Rule 3 of the Commercial Courts Rules\n\nRule 3 of the Commercial Courts Rules gives a directory flavor to mediation on account of the defendant’s lack of consent to mediate. Rule 3 postulates the filing of an application by the plaintiff for the initiation of mediation and forwarding notice of the same to the defendant. Further, it postulates the delivery of a final notice if the defendant is irresponsive of the notices. However, the issue arises with the declaration of the mediation as “non-starter” by the concerned authority if the aforementioned notices go answered. Declaring a mediation as a “non-starter” would effectively give leeway to the defendant to escape the procedure of mediation. Not-withstanding such a partisan provision, the Apex Court to a great extent insistently went on to uphold that there must be harmonious interpretation between Section 12A and Rule 3. The court rationalized that the use of ‘may’ in the rule did not detract with the mandatory flavor of Section 12A and only provided three different ways for an application to institute mediation. The Apex Court in upholding the mandate in Section 12A has read down Rule 3 and stated that the rule is merely indicative of a modicum of voluntariness given to the defendant and that a “non-starter” would not affect the mandatory nature of Section 12A (paragraph 72). The ruling of the Apex Court is actually indicative of a scenario where if upon non-compliance of mediation proceedings by the defendant, the plaintiff approaches courts for appropriate relief, the same would be rejected for no-exhaustion of the mandate to firstly mediate. Such an anomaly is also in contravention with the procedure for pre-institution mediation and settlement of the Delhi State Legal Services Authority. The SOP of the same states that upon the marking of a matter as “non-starter”, the plaintiff is at liberty to approach the courts for appropriate remedy. \n\nConclusion\n\nWith the Mediation Bill 2021 awaiting approval, potential that underlies mediation as a dispute resolution mechanism largely remains untapped under Section 89 of CPC. Section 89 postulates court ordered mediation, but Section 12A temporarily suspends the interference of courts which initially was the legislative intent behind the 2018 amendment. Owing to the above discussion, it is evidently safe to assert that the ruling will result in substantial reduction in the burden of commercial courts and uphold the larger objective of promoting India as one of the major commercial hubs in the world. It is imperative to construe Section 12A in a mandatory nature in order to prevent institution of suits which do not urge urgent relief, thereby reducing the burden of commercial courts.\nMediationCommercial CourtsDispute Resolution\nDispute Resolution\n1,160 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Analyzing Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel and Power",
        "content": "Harsh Tomar\nSep 21, 2022\n7 min read\nAnalyzing Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel and Power\n[Harsh is a student at National Law School of India University.]\n\nIn Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel and Power Limited (Jagatramka) the Supreme Court opined that the disqualifications placed under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India 2016 (IBC) will also apply to the scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013 (Companies Act) when the company is at the stage of liquidation. In this piece, the author analyses this decision of the Supreme Court. The author has tried to present a critique on the judgment from an exclusive legal positivist and law and economics perspectives and argued that there was no need to take the interpretative approach to which the court relied on. \n\nANALYSIS OF THE JUDGMENT\n\nExclusive legal positivists believe that law requires a source to gain authoritativeness or validity. As per them “all law is source based, and anything which is not source based is not law”. This is generally referred as the source thesis. \n\nNow coming to the judgment, a literal interpretation of Section 230 will suggest that there are no ineligibilities described for bringing a scheme for compromise and arrangement under Section 230 like those which are present in Section 29A of IBC. Section 230 does not disqualify the promoter to propose a scheme of compromise or arrangement. However, by importing these ineligibilities to the concerned provision without the statutory mandate, it is submitted that the Supreme Court in Jagatramka has violated the ‘sources’ thesis. The source for compromise and arrangement is Section 230 of Companies Act. Under this provision, once an application is submitted, the NCLT may call for a meeting between the different class of creditors or members who will then decide by voting on the adequacy of the proposal. If the proposed scheme is approved by the required number of votes,  the NCLT will give a stamp of validity to the accepted proposal and thereby it becomes binding. However, NCLT may refuse to give its approval if there is breach of Sections 230(1), 232 or 68 of the Companies Act. There is no other provision under which NCLT can refuse to give sanction to the proposal accepted in the meeting. However, as per the decision in Jagatramka, if the proposal is submitted by the people falling under Section 29A, it should also be refused. In this case, Jagatramka was the one who brought the proposal and was the promoter of the company. Since promoter is the member of the company, it is no doubt that he is eligible to bring proposal for scheme and arrangement under Section 230.\n\nHowever, the question which then becomes relevant is why the SC came to this conclusion.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for such conclusion of the court was because of their purposive interpretation to Section 29A. It is submitted that this approach towards interpreting Section 29A is nothing new and the judgment in Jagatramka is just an addition to the line of cases where court has relied on such interpretative approach to Section 29A of IBC. In Jagatramka itself, the court cited some of these judgments including Arcelormittal India Private Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Others, Chitra Sharma v. Union of India, and Swiss Ribbons Private Limited v. Union of India. These cases clearly describe the judiciary’s attitude towards Section 29A of IBC. It has already been argued by many that Section 29A is quite broad. Despite this, courts and tribunals have given purposive interpretation to it which has extended its scope further. The judgment in Jagatramka case is one more example of this. \n\nBut is this extension of judiciary’s interference in the insolvency or liquidation stage acceptable? It is submitted that it is not. It is to be noted that the reorganisation under Section 230 is maybe the last possible option available for the revival of a distressed company. Hence, there should be minimum restrictions imposed at this stage and commercial wisdom of the creditors or the members as the case may be should be revered. This will also help in realising one of the objectives of IBC which is to protect the surplus value of the corporate entity and preventing it from piecemeal liquidation. There may be situations where the promoters are willing to propose the highest bid and the creditors also confident that they are better in accepting the proposal of the promoter. In that scenario, the restrictions under the concerned section will result the creditors being devoid of the extra price offered by the promoters. In such case, the judiciary is interfering with the commercial wisdom of creditors. It is argued that by taking a purposive interpretation and reading the ineligibilities to Section 230, the court in Jagatramka seems to be favouring commercial morality rather than commercial wisdom. However, according to Raz, the task of judges is to apply law as it is before them; they are not supposed to use moral acumen to make judgments. In this case, the court by ignoring the literal interpretation relied on the grounds like commercial morality and absurdity to prohibit promoters from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement which was not supported by the law on the same. Hence, it is argued that this is clearly against the exclusive legal positivists' understanding of judges’ role or power in adjudication. \n\nAs per the exclusive legal positivists, the purpose of law is to settle the debate. Hence, it becomes important for judges to apply law as it is posited in statutes. However, when judges make judgments based on moral considerations and go against the posited law, they re-settle such debates. This resettling leads to reallocation of resources opposite to what is envisaged in the statute as it imposes costs on the parties as they make actions on the basis of the settled law assuming it to be the law of the land. However, when court re-settles the debate, they are compelled to change their actions accordingly and hence bear extra costs due to such re-settling.\n\nTalking only about Section 29A, if the creditors whose money is involved are getting what they want and at the same time the resolution plan is fulfilling all the requirements, the need to reject it on ground that the applicant was ineligible at the first place is questionable. Similar argument should also apply to Section 230 if read with Section 29A and Section 35 of IBC. If creditors are fine with the proposal by the promoter, it is argued that there is no need for courts or tribunals to question their commercial wisdom.\n\nIt is to be noted that one of the purposes of IBC is also to maximise the value of assets. If promoters who are the willing to propose the highest amount are prohibited for bringing such proposal and the proposal of the one with the lower bid is accepted, it may be argued that there will not be maximisation of assets for the benefit of the creditors or the members which will therefore defeat one of the important purposes of IBC. It may possibly also defeat objective of effective revival of the entity as the promoters who are familiar with the business and the company are precluded to take part in the process of revival or debt-restructuring.\n\nThe language of the scheme of compromise and arrangement has changed from the Companies Act 1956 to the Companies Act 2013. The difference between the two is that now the scope of intervention of the judiciary has been reduced. Earlier, when the scheme is approved by the required number of votes, the tribunal could interfere with the approved scheme on grounds such as public interests and prejudice to the interests of the members. Additionally, the tribunal also enjoyed some residuary powers to make incidental, consequential and supplemental orders for ensuring full and effective realisation of the scheme. However, the same grounds are not provided under the Companies Act. From this difference, it is clear that the legislature intended to limit the role of judiciary with the compromise or arrangement process and wanted to give deference to the commercial wisdom of the creditors or the members. Additionally, in Miheer Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Limited, the Supreme Court, while discussing the tribunal’s jurisdiction in reviewing the scheme of arrangement, clarified that the jurisdiction is “peripheral and supervisory and not appellate”. However, arguably, the court in Jagatramka has expanded its jurisdiction beyond the legal mandate by reading the ineligibilities in Section 230.\n It is important to remember that the scheme of compromise and arrangement and insolvency resolution mechanism under IBC are two different modes of debt restructuring. They are meant to serve different purposes and work at different stages. The core idea behind these concepts is different. In the insolvency under the IBC, it is debtor-in control model while this is mostly not the case with the scheme under Section 230. IBC and the Companies Act are both economic legislations, hence commercial wisdom of creditors and members should be given deference and such should not be ignored at the cost of morality.\n\nThe process of debt-restructuring under Section 230 is already quite cumbersome. NCLT will divide the creditors and the members in different classes. Each such class will then vote on the proposed scheme. Such scheme is required to be approved by a majority, representing 75% in value of each class of creditors or shareholders present and voting, in separate meetings for each class. Due to such complexities the mechanism has rarely been used and has remained ineffective. Therefore, reading some more complex and unwarranted ineligibilities into the section will further restrict its usage. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe purpose of law is to settle the debate. However, when judges make judgments based on moral considerations and going against the posited law, they re-settle such debates. This resettling also imposes the costs on the parties as they make actions on the basis of the settled law, but when court re-settles the debate, they get forced to change their actions accordingly and hence bear extra costs due to such re-settling. \n\nSection 29A of IBC has laid down a multi-layered standard of disqualification for excluding persons from participating in the resolution process. However, the Supreme Court by its judgment in  Jagatramka has extended its application to Section 230 of the Companies Act. However, at a stage when it is the last possible opportunity for the revival of the company and preventing it from foreseeable corporate death, making such comprehensive ineligibilities can effectively restrict the chances of revival of the company as some important stakeholders will be debarred from bringing proposal to save it which, as has been argued, will also not be in line with the objectives of the IBC. Rather than imposing a blanket ban, a possible solution could be adopted by taking a middle ground where people like promoters and directors who are well aware of the functioning of the company are at least allowed to bring such proposals. At the same time, if the creditors or the members accept their offer and other requirements under the Companies Act are met, certain safeguards should be introduced to ensure that the creditors get what they were promised. Additionally, it is suggested that the judiciary should limit its interference to the extent of ensuring that the sanctity of the process is not compromised. It should allow the creditors and the proposer to negotiate amongst themselves a proposal which benefits the creditors as well as the company. However, the tribunal should interfere when such negotiation causes prejudice to the minority members and ensure that they are well compensated for the same.\nIBCCreditorCIRPSection 29-A\nInsolvency Law\n942 views\n4 likes.

        "title": "RBI’s Double-Edged Sword: The Digital Lending Guidelines",
        "content": "Prateek\nSep 17, 2022\n5 min read\nRBI’s Double-Edged Sword: The Digital Lending Guidelines\n[Prateek is a graduate of Army Institute of Law, Mohali.]\n\nThe RBI implemented the Digital Lending Guidelines on 10 August 2022, based on recommendations of the Working Group on Digital Lending constituted in January 2021. Prima facie, the guidelines are aimed at curbing unfair and predatory lending practices, while providing technological frameworks strengthening privacy and data security, and promoting the use of AI for assistance in underwriting debt by lending service providers (LSP).\n\nConsidering the vulnerability of India’s digital lending userbase to predatory lending practices, the RBI has undertaken these guidelines to perform its duty to safeguard the market. Consecutively, these safeguards ensure that consumer trust in the lending and banking sector is maintained. This is especially relevant for digital lending since the digital divide in India causes the most vulnerable classes to lack digital literacy and legal awareness. Conversely, it is this class of users who are shunned by traditional lending sources, whom the rising digital lending platforms aim to serve. This lack of access to traditional sources of credit is due to the underwriting standards requiring formal employment or credit histories to determine creditworthiness. For classes that are new to the financial scene and lack credit history, or lack employment in the formal sectors, digital lending becomes the only source of easy credit. Thus, the guidelines serve the important purpose of ensuring safety in financial inclusivity with the growing digitization of India’s populous.\n\nOn the consumer end, the guidelines provide for prohibitions on unconsented and automatic increases in borrowing limits by LSPs, provision for cooling off periods and an assertion of regulatory control of the RBI on unregulated LSPs by requiring Regulated Entities to conduct review of the LSPs at regular intervals. Most importantly, the guidelines mandate LSPs to provide prospective users with a key fact statement (KFS), thus reducing opacity in lending.\n\nOn the technological side, the guidelines ensure data privacy through limitations on the nature and extent of data collected by LSPs, along with a mandate requiring localisation of data onto Indian servers.\n\nNeed Analysis: RBI’s Safeguarding Perspective\n\nThe digital lending market in India is undergoing exponential growth, with new products like 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) gaining prominence. Expansion of digital lending is further fuelled by collaboration between the fintech sector with financial players. Market leaders in fintech, like One97 Communications’ PayTM, have also entered the market, with PayTM recently announcing a partnership with Piramal Finance to offer merchant lending services, with long-term plans of entering the consumer lending space. Further, global firms have also begun entering the Indian digital lending space through strategic investments in domestic players.\n\nThis sector is plagued by risky underwriting and predatory lending practices due to a prior lack of regulatory framework. The 'rent-an-NBFC' model, which allows for high-risk underwriting by lenders owing to first loss default guarantee (FLDG) by LSPs, is evidence of the same. The FLDG model allows non-regulated LSPs to guarantee a predetermined proportion of the loan in case of default. This encourages risky underwriting of credit by NBFC partners as they find reassurance in LSPs having some skin in the game.\n\nThus, a need was felt for hegemonizing risky underwriting practices in the digital lending space, especially when Non-Performing Assets are already a major issue in India. Inflation, in the age of consumerism, also increases the propensity for impulse purchases, as evidenced by spikes observed in BNPL models during festive seasons. This provides legitimacy to the regulatory frameworks that the guidelines provide.\n\nThe Dual Counternarrative of Market Incentivisation\n\nWhile the guidelines are fairly comprehensive, the probable counternarrative is dichotomous in terms of market incentivisation. This dichotomy is in the form of disincentives harming consumer adoption, as well as disincentives creating low profitability for businesses.\n\nConsumer incentive in this sector is largely driven by low accessibility to traditional credit sources for certain classes that either lack formal employment, or lack substantial credit history which makes underwriting riskier for institutions. Since these classes are shunned by traditional banking systems with regards to extension of credit, they provide a ripe market for the digital lending market, which till now was lacking any regulatory mandate requiring underwriting standards applicable to the traditional sources of credit. The FLDG model, for instance, makes underwriting loans easier for NBFCs since part of the risk is borne by the LSP. This allows NBFCs to underwrite loans for individuals who might not meet the high standards of creditworthiness set by traditional lending agencies. Regulation of these models will inevitably cause exclusion of the classes that earlier provided a ripe market for these digital lending platforms.\n\nOn the business incentive end, BNPL models are increasingly popular as a business opportunity for FinTech players. RBI has made the Digital Lending Guidelines specifically applicable on the BNPL model as well, thereby increasing the operating costs for these businesses due to regulatory requirements creating compliance cost. This hampers prospective growth for these capital-intensive businesses, since profitability of BNPL business is materially dependent on late fees by consumers for models lacking interest fees. For models that include interest fees, ambiguity on cooling-off period may translate into a regulatory bar on prepayment penalty, thus reducing profitability for them as well. Counterintuitively, competition in the sector is already high, fuelled by domestic and foreign investments hoping to cash-in on the massive potential consumer base. This increased competition also leads to an increase in customer acquisition cost for LSPs due to advertising costs. The lowered profitability paired with a high customer acquisition cost is a death sentence for many of these platforms lacking the necessary capital, creating breeding grounds for domination by larger players.\n\nConclusion\n Digital lending in India is in its nascent stage, with massive scope for driving market growth in other sectors by increasing consumer spending through ease of access to credit. Current limitations range from primacy of traditional credit sources and prevalent credit-aversive behaviour of consumers. Thus, there is a need to create trust in the lending sector to normalise undertaking credit, through the establishment of better recollection practices. Therefore, the debt recovery framework should not be deferred or left to market players for formulation, and should instead be formalised more effectively by the legislature itself. \n\nRBI’s intention is to safeguard consumers from predatory lending practices, while minimizing default propensity. But the guidelines in their current stage, as observed above, fail to provide the necessary levels of debt security. Counter-intuitively, it can be argued that growth of public trust in digital lending spawns a cognitive dissonance in consumer borrowing mindsets where undertaking short-term digital debts are perceived as more viable. Current apprehensiveness regarding data security, debt-recollection, uncertainty on lender policy and costs, create an environment where digital lending might be perceived as an option undertaken as per need, not to simply satisfy wants. As evidenced by spikes in consumer purchases during festive season through BNPL programs, simplification leads to lowered apprehension about undertaking such debts for consumer wants. The guidelines, while currently unable to provide structural debt security, enable systematic changes that create consumer trust in digital lending. This weakens the cognitive dissonance between ease of liquidity that debt provides, against credit aversion, with the latter being weakened by consumer trust. \n\nSuch a systematic change might enable risk-seeking behaviour, and thus, the need for structural modifications to models like 'rent-an-NBFC' are only exasperated by the guidelines in their current state. That being said, the Working Committee’s recommendation of completely eliminating FLDG models would be detrimental to the niche customer base that digital lending businesses aim at targeting, since it is this demonstration of underwriting skills, which allow for disbursal of credit to individuals otherwise deemed less creditworthy by traditional sources of credit.\nRBIDigital LendingBNPL\nCorporate Law\n296 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "The Vidarbha Ruling: Opening up Pandora’s Box",
        "content": "Sanya Goel\nSep 16, 2022\n5 min read\nThe Vidarbha Ruling: Opening up Pandora’s Box\n[Sanya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) was enacted with the intention of simplifying and fastening the process of insolvency proceedings in India while ensuring maximization of value to all stakeholders. Prompt acceptance of defaulting enterprises into the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) to stop additional value degradation due to delay is a crucial step in achieving this goal. However, the Supreme Court in the recent case of Vidarbha Industries Power Limited v. Axis Bank Limited (Vidarbha) has put forth a contention that will have contradictory implications. \n\nThis article examines the Supreme Court’s judgement in this particular case and examines the dire consequences that it will have on the effectiveness on a ground-breaking legislation such as the IBC. \n\nOne Step Forward, Two Steps Back\n\nThe initiation of a CIRP can be done by a financial creditor (FC) or an operational creditor (OC) under Section 7 and Section 9 of IBC respectively. These provisions were probed into and given clarity on in the landmark judgement of M/s Innoventive Industries Limited v. ICICI Bank and Another. (Innoventive). Prior to Innoventive, there was uncertainty surrounding the factors National Company Law Tribunals (NCLT) should consider when assessing an application under Section 7 of the IBC. Common defences used by corporate debtors (CD) included the claim that the default was unintended, brought on by events outside their control, or they were otherwise financially solvent. The Supreme Court's dual objective tests of ‘debt’ and ‘default’, which were established in Innoventive, helped resolve and streamline the Section 7 application adjudication process, bringing an end to this ambiguity. It was stated by the Supreme Court that,\n\n“The moment the adjudicating authority is satisfied that a default has occurred, the application must be admitted unless it is incomplete...”.\n\nThis statement made by the court in Innoventive has been the benchmark for NCLTs and NCLATs to decide cases pertaining to Section 7 of the IBC until 12 July 2022 when the Supreme Court gave the judgement for Vidarbha Industries Power Limited v. Axis Bank Limited. The court decided that despite the court being convinced of the existence of a debt and the CD being in default, Section 7(5)(a) of IBC given the NCLT discretion to refuse to admit an application for CIRP submitted by an FC. Contrastingly, it is also noted that, if an application for CIRP submitted by an OC satisfies the same conditions of ‘debt’ and ‘default’, the NCLT has to mandatorily admit the application. The court pointed out that typically, the word ‘may’ is directory and the phrase ‘may admit’ gives admission discretion. However, the term ‘shall’ implies a rule that must be followed. The court assumed the legislation’s intentions by stating that the use of the word ‘may’ in Section 7(5)(a) in contrast to the use of the word ‘shall’ in Section 9(5)(i) by the legislature meant to imply the discretionary powers that were intended to be given to the court in matters of Section 7(5)(a). The court suggested that this difference in the use of words for two provisions that are almost similar in nature was a conscious effort made by the legislators to imply that the OC will be impacted more severely than the FC in case of a non- payment of admitted dues.  It held that in cases where the application for the CIRP is filed by a FC, the court can take all relevant factors like the financial capability of the CD in exercising its discretionary power to not admit the application if it deems fit. However, in cases where the application is filed by an OC, it is mandatory for the court to admit such an application. It inferred that there is a need for the NCLT to ‘apply its mind to relevant factors’ because the IBC does not intend to ‘penalize solvent companies, temporarily defaulting in repayment of its financial debts’. Additionally, a note of caution was given by the court expressing that such discretionary powers should not be used in an arbitrary manner.\n\nShould the Law Have Room for Subjectivity? \n\nWhile a note of caution for the courts to not use these discretionary powers arbitrarily is added in the Vidarbha ruling, it is important to note that there is an absence of clarity on the parameters for this discretion. The court’s statement in this judgement reverses the clock by taking us back to the chaotic era where the factors of ‘default’ and ‘debt’ were not established by the Innoventive case. Judgements were given differently according to the differing facts of the case and circumstances of the CD. The lack of a proper test to establish whether or not a company should be brought into insolvency proceedings created a considerably unfair and chaotic situation which is why the Court considered the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee and shifted the parameter for CIRP from ‘inability to pay’ debt to ‘default’ in paying debt. This ruling established the unimportance of the cause of default during financial distress and established that as long as a CD had ‘defaulted’ in repayment of ‘debt’, they could be filed for insolvency. Therefore, the fact that the Court in Vidarbha has stated otherwise gives the insolvency law a significant room for subjectivity. \n\nObjectivity in deciding if a CD should be brought into the CIRP can be seen in the insolvency laws of the United Kingdom and the United States of America as well. The UK insolvency law allows a single creditor or a group of creditors to file an application for insolvency proceedings to be started given that the company which is the debtor is obligated to pay more than £750 and the debt is not disputed. Similarly, the American insolvency law allows one or more creditors to file a petition with the Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 7 of their Bankruptcy Code which qualifies a debtor for insolvency proceedings given that the remaining amount after subtracting the debtor’s expenses from their gross income is not sufficient to clear the debt. Hence, it is evident that the insolvency laws in the UK and the USA also use similar parameters of ‘default’ and ‘debt’ to admit an application filed by a creditor for insolvency proceedings which has clearly been working perfectly well in the UK and the USA, as well as India. \n\nTherefore, the ruling in Vidarbha has failed to move alongside not only the landmark judgement in Innoventive, but also the insolvency laws in other prestigious countries and led the Indian insolvency law to considerable amount of subjectivity, which is harmful for the country’s insolvency law in the long run because it makes it incomprehensible and unfair to a certain extent. The insolvency regime in India has already been facing an issue of delays in admission of CIRP applications which is further ignited by the passing of this judgement.  IBC has never been seen as a recovery mechanism, however, financial order among the CDs has significantly improved due to the fear of being sent into the CIRP given that the parameters for the same are fixed, which has been hindered by Vidarbha. \n\nConclusion\n\nThis ruling will open up a pandora’s box to multiple claims of the debtor’s inability to pay along with requests for the circumstances of the debtor to be considered by the court before sending the company into insolvency. The entire purpose of IBC being enacted was to establish an effective framework for insolvency resolution in a time-bound manner which has been hampered by this ruling. Looking into the ability of the CD to pay the debt and its financial health not only questions the aim of IBC, but also adds a significant delay in the admission of CIRP applications which in turn decreases the effectiveness of IBC in entirety. \nIBCVidarbhaCIRPInnoventive\nInsolvency Law\n254 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Evaluating SEBI’s Interpretation of RA and Investment Advisor Regulations Against its Ramifications",
        "content": "Aditya Singh\nSep 12, 2022\n7 min read\nEvaluating SEBI’s Interpretation of RA and Investment Advisor Regulations Against its Ramifications\n[Aditya is a student at National Law School of India University.]\n\nIn May 2022, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) passed a settlement order against Amit Jeswani, a research analyst (RA) for marketing model stock portfolios.[1] The same was predicated by the fact that his actions were in violation of the SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations 2014 (RA regulations) and SEBI (Investment Advisors) Regulations 2013 (IA regulations). In the aftermath of the same, there is news that SEBI has constituted a working group to deliberate on the role of RAs.\n\nThis interpretation of the RA regulations has multiple ramifications. A pertinent one is its impact on the services of fintechs such as Smallcase, WealthDesk, ET Money, etc., as many of the curated portfolios they offer are made by RAs. To look at the industry leader Smallcase, many of the portfolios listed on it are designed by firms such as Windmill Capital, Weekend Investing, Green Portfolio, etc. which are RA firms.[2] Excluding RAs from participating in this market will probably lead to a rise in the investment costs in these products. The other negative effects also include reduced operational efficiency of the markets and reduction of freelance work avenues for RAs, hence jeopardizing their independence, which is antithetical to the objective of RA regulations.\n\nThe objective of this article is to present an alternative to SEBI’s interpretation of the regulations. Further, this article also brings out the need to allow RAs to model portfolios because it benefits all stakeholders including fintechs, consumers, analysts and the market dynamics, consequentially furthering the regulatory objective of the RA regulations.\n\nTo that end, the article will, at first, analyse the relevant regulations to prove that the act is permissible. Thereafter, the article will explore the nexus of the portfolios and their low cost to market efficiency, while also proving that it furthers the regulation’s objective of ensuring RA’s independence. Subsequently, this article will suggest a way forward to prove that it is feasible to carry the proposal forward due to its regulatable nature.\n\nOn the Point of Legal Interpretation\n\nThe analysis of RA regulations and IA regulations requires a two-stage engagement. Firstly, coming to IA regulations, the simplest argument to prove that an RA posting model portfolios on an online platform will not be considered investment advice, would be that the same is available to the public at large hence falling under the stated exception in Regulation 2(l).\n\nApart from that, Regulation 2(l) includes ‘advice on investment portfolio,’ hence it should not cover the activity of just making portfolios based on research and marketing them within its ambit. This is because the definition also requires the act to be in the capacity of ‘financial planning’ [as defined in Regulation 2(h)] which includes identification of various personalized aspects such as the client’s financial situation, goals, etc. Therefore, as long as a portfolio is not made specific to a client’s requirements after consultation, it cannot be said that it is exclusively in the domain of an investment advisor. \n\nMoving on to RA regulations, while Regulation 2(u) defines the duties of an RA, they are labelled as ‘primary duties’ and hence the list cannot be interpreted exhaustively. They should not be prohibited from doing something unless the activity strictly falls under the role of an investment advisor or in public interest in case the conflict of interest is inevitable and cannot be prevented by regulation. Even while preparing model portfolios, the RAs in the process have to make adjoining research reports, hence they are not discarding their primary duty per se. The nature of their work makes them well suited to design and rejig model portfolios owing to their general research on buy and sell points of various stocks without any client-specific considerations. \n\nEfficiency in the Markets\n\nWhile transactional efficiency has been achieved, leading to the addition of more retail investors in the market, the second front of having adequate coverage of various listed companies, availability of quality research at affordable prices and the tools to fructify its usage is necessary. This is a facet of the ‘efficient markets theory’ which states that the true value of an asset is only reflected when all the information is factored in. In the instant scenario, while analysts fulfil one end by aggregating vast amounts of financial data, it must also be traded upon to be factored in the prices. However, for a piece of information to be tradable, there must also be platforms with instruments that enable the same to be converted into a purchase.\n\nThe described fintechs perform both these roles by putting together quality research of analysts as they use the same to build these portfolios. At the same time, it also assists people in investing by enabling them to choose broad trends and sectors as opposed to hand-picking stocks which is a more ambiguous and uneconomical alternative. This theory was also employed by SEBI in their 2013 consultation paper on the proposal to regulate RAs to state their importance in aggregation of raw data and its timely delivery. However, their narrow interpretation of the RA regulations can be a hindrance to achieving the objective. While the article in the next section discusses how the probability of conflict of interest and biased reporting reduces in this model, there is no additional risk of the same as compared to the status quo. Hence, the cost-benefit scale weighs in favour of allowing the RAs to create and list model portfolios on these fintech platforms.\n\nIndependence of RAs\n\nEnsuring the independence of RAs and managing the disclosures of their conflicts of interest happens to be one of the key objectives of the RA regulations. The whole of Chapter III, starting from the requirement of affixing internal regulations to prevent conflict of interests from reflecting in reports in Regulation 15, recording the rationale behind arriving at recommendations in Regulation 25, preventing former company managers from issuing recommendations related to their former companies in Regulation 19(iv), etc. is provisioned to prevent an analyst’s work from being prejudiced by their or their employers’ interests. \n\nNow to view this in light of the practical operations in the stock market, these fintechs provide RAs with a platform to freelance and earn revenue out of their independent research while also building their forum. The alternative line of profession for them is to work for conventional investment banks, brokerages, etc. There is a historical record to show that the probability of production of biased reports is much higher in this setup as there is an inclination to cater to the employer’s requirements.[3] The most suitable example of this would be the ‘Global Analyst Research Settlement’ where the ten largest investment banks in the USA were made to pay a monetary compensation of $875 million to remedy the damages their biased reports had caused. While measures were taken to ensure the independence of analysts and prevent conflict of interests, several banks stopped purchasing external research when the settlement duration ended in 2009.\n\nThere cannot be a better method of ensuring the independence of analysts than promoting avenues of freelancing because the demand for a RA’s work will sustain with consistent returns, the key to which is a portfolio built on unbiased and objective factors.\n\nDuties of the Intermediary and the Way Forward\n\nWhile the SEBI’s concern about analysts’ bias and investor exploitation is valid, a complete ban on RAs from creating these instruments is not the way forward because of its benefits and there being scope for regulation. As stated, most of the listed model portfolios available on fintechs currently are by RAs. \n The way forward is to nurture a tech interface with the maximum transparency possible without overregulation because of the above-stated benefits. This can be achieved by displaying various details such as the methodology and strategy based on which the portfolio was compiled and the credentials including the academic qualifications of the analyst or the background of the company in case the analyst is a corporation. There must also be a list of all the institutional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest while also keeping the analyst’s personal portfolio trackable by the intermediary and SEBI to enable self-regulation wherever possible. The display should also include other details such as the return of the portfolio since its offer date and not just the CAGR of a blanket timeframe such as a year or 5 years. To increase awareness and make assessment easier for the investors, an intermediary vetted SWOT analysis of every portfolio should be present since one of the regulator’s concerns is also of accountability. Furthermore, to ensure that there is no manipulation later on, the analysts in line with Regulation 25 of the RA regulations should also provide the rationale behind rejigging and rebalancing the portfolio, and discretion should be given to the investor wherever possible.  \n\nThese are all fintech interface-specific guidelines that are convenient to implement, enable self-regulation and also further the objectives of the RA regulations that is broadly to promote objective and reliable research which is unbiased. This also satisfies Principle 26 of IOSCO Principles and Objectives of Security Regulation which requires that there should be disclosures “necessary to evaluate the suitability of a collective investment scheme for a particular investor and the value of the investor’s interest in the scheme\", and neither does it violate any of the other principles of regulation of collective investment schemes.[4]\n\nWith only 820 RAs and 1,328 investment advisors as opposed to staggering 11.2 crore investors registered with BSE alone, it would not be logical for SEBI to stick with the current interpretation especially when the sector can be efficiently regulated through both self-regulation and oversight.\n[1] Settlement Order No: SO/GR/BM/2022-23/663 [3].\n[2] Windmill Capital has a total of 54 listed portfolios on Smallcase.\n[3] See also; Fisch (n 9); Jaimee L.

        "title": "Unifying the Divide: Putting a Nail in the Debate of DG’s Ownership under Indian Competition Law",
        "content": "Kabir Singh\nSep 5, 2022\n6 min read\nUnifying the Divide: Putting a Nail in the Debate of DG’s Ownership under Indian Competition Law\n[Kabir is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act) was brought into force with the aim of ensuring fair competition, and it does so by actively stopping activities which cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition. In furtherance of the same, Section 16(1) of the Competition Act allows the appointment of a Director General (DG), who is responsible for assisting the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in conducting inquiries into any contravention of the Competition Act. Widely recognised as the investigative wing of the CCI, the DG is responsible for preparing the final investigative report on the basis of which the CCI determines whether a contravention of the Competition Act has occurred or not. Thus, the DG plays an essential and irreplaceable role in enforcement of competition law in India, making it important for us to understand DG’s structure, and most importantly, ascertain its ownership. \n\nThe question of the DG’s ownership has been a legal conundrum since the enactment of the Competition Act years ago, and addressing it would not only lead to administrative benefits, but also enhance the enforcement of competition law in India. While, on a prima facie glance, one might conclude that since the DG only exists for the purpose of assisting the CCI with investigations, it is the latter which controls the former. However, upon a closer reading of Section 16(1) of the Competition Act, we may come to a different conclusion. Section 16(1) of the Competition Act states that “The Central Government may, by notification, appoint a Director General for the purposes of assisting the Commission in conducting inquiry” (emphasis supplied). While the latter half (“assisting the Commission in conducting inquiry”) furthers the argument of CCI controlling the DG, the section itself begins with stating that it is “the Central Government” which is responsible for the appointment of the DG. This leads to the possibility of the fact that it is the Central Government which is responsible for controlling the DG, rather than the CCI. These two contrasting theories of control require us to examine the nature and extent of control possessed by the Central Government and the CCI over the DG. \n\nThe Central Government: De Jure Control \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is the Central Government which is responsible for the appointment of the DG. Their extent of control over the DG is further reflected from the role played by them under the Competition Commission of India (Director General) Recruitment Rules 2009 (Recruitment Rules) and the Competition Commission of India (Number of Additional, Joint, Deputy or Assistant Director-General Other Officers and Employees, Their Manner of Appointment, Qualification, Salary, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service) Rules 2009 (Office Rules) i.e., rules formed under Section 16 of the Competition Act for the functioning and formation of the DG. Both the Recruitment Rules and the Office Rules grant the Central Government a huge amount of control over the DG, as they allow the former to govern and manage the latter’s appointment, the number of appointments, the qualifications required, key human resources such as salary, offices, leaves etc. \n\nAnother example of the Central Government’s continuous control over the DG is the mandated presence of Central Government officials (such as the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs; Expert-person appointed by Central Government) for not only the appointment of the DG, but also for evaluating their performance and deciding their future promotions under the Departmental Promotion Committee, which is formed under the Office Rules. The usage of the word continuous is to denote the fact that the Central Government’s control over the DG does not cease to exist after the DG’s appointment, and instead continues even after the appointment.\n\nHence, we may reasonably infer from the above, that under the current framework, the DG’s accountability lies with the Central Government, rather than with the CCI. The Central Government’s control over the DG may be described as de jure in nature, as it solely arises from the ownership framework of the DG, as mandated by the present legal framework. \n\nThe Competition Commission of India: De Facto Control\n\nIt is important to note that while according to the current legislative framework the DG’s control lies with the Central Government, the same is not necessarily true in practice. Interestingly, once the DG’s appointment is over, it is the CCI which is responsible for giving the DG directions, keeping track of its actions and dealing with its administrative aspects. To illustrate, only the CCI under Section 26 of the Competition Act may direct the DG to conduct investigations. The DG is also legally obligated to submit its findings to the DG, and must perform its duties without fail. The CCI’s control over the DG has also been recognised by courts at various junctures. For example, the Supreme Court in 2010, in the matter of CCI v. Steel Authority of India Limited, noted that the DG is “a specialized investigating wing of the Commission”. The same assists us in inferring the court’s position in terms of recognising that the DG comes under the purview and control of the CCI, in the form of an investigative wing. This position has also been reiterated in 2019 by the Delhi High Court in the case of Mahindra and Mahindra Limited v CCI and Another, wherein the court emphasised on the DG’s role as an investigative wing of the CCI, and its importance in carrying out investigations. Hence, the same may be used to reasonably infer that the CCI exercises de facto control (Latin for ‘in fact’) over the DG, as while its control does not arise from the DG’s legal framework (like that of the Central Government), it still controls the DG in practice and is able to influence its day-to-day functioning. \n\nThus, while the DG is accountable to the Central Government on paper due to the present legal framework (de jure control), the CCI is the one that actually exercises control over the DG in practice (de facto control). \n\nThe Way Forward: Unifying the Divide\n\nHence, as noted in the beginning of this article, there exists a lot of dubiety with respect to whose purview does the DG actually come under. The current Indian model seems to closely resemble the bifurcated agency model, under which a competition authority carries out specialised investigative functions (the DG), and presents the violations before a different authority which carries out adjudicative functions (the CCI). This model, despite being followed by a few countries such as Chile, Canada, etc. has certain shortcomings, and hence the draft Competition (Amendment) Bill 2020 recommended leaving the current model and shifting towards the integrated agency model. \n\nUnder this model (integrated agency model), a competition authority possesses both investigative and adjudicative powers. Applying the same in India would translate into reality by merging the DG Office with the CCI, thereby putting a nail in the debate of the DG’s ownership. This merger would also bring India in line with established international practice, as the integrated agency model is followed by numerous jurisdictions such as the USA, the European Union, China, Brazil, etc. Moreover, this shift of competition model is not unprecedented in nature, as Brazil too did the same in 2012, for the sake of improving their competition law framework.\n\nTo elaborate, Brazil’s erstwhile competition law regime consisted of – (a) the Administrative Council for Economic Defence (an administrative decision-making tribunal responsible for anti-competitive cases); (b) the Secretariat of Economic Law of the Ministry of Justice (the investigative wing for looking into anticompetitive mergers and cases); and (c) the Secretariat for Economic Monitoring of the Ministry of Finance (majorly performing advocacy functions and giving non-binding opinion in mergers). With the introduction of Law Number 12,529/11 on 30 November 2011, the previously three different competition authorities were unified to form a single all-functioning agency, the new Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE). This agency unification, largely motivated by the need of increasing institutional efficiency, proved to be a massive success. Over the last 10 years, Brazil’s new CADE has shown to be incredibly efficient, by virtue of reducing function overlap between multiple agencies, and is regarded to be one of the most reputed competition law enforcement agencies across the world, especially from an institutional point of view. \n\nA similar merger between the DG’s office and CCI in India, would lead to the unification of the de jure and de facto control over the DG, and would bring the law in alignment with the followed practice. The merger would also yield benefits with respect to administrative matters, conducting investigations and adjudications, by increasing efficiency, reducing timelines etc. Moreover, the merger might lead to the appointment of DG’s who possess greater domain expertise, since appointments made under the CCI need not be via deputation, unlike the current legal regime. \n\nTo conclude, with a view to resolving the debate of the DG’s ownership, alongside improving India’s competition law regime as a whole, it is recommended that the DG’s office is merged with the CCI.\nCompetition ActCCIDGCompetition\nCompetition Law\n662 views\n9 likes.

        "title": "Dark Patterns vis-à-vis Indian Competition Law: A New Dark Horse?",
        "content": "Swetha Somu\nSep 4, 2022\n6 min read\nDark Patterns vis-à-vis Indian Competition Law: A New Dark Horse?\n[Swetha is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nThe term ‘dark patterns’, coined by Harry Brignull, simply means a user interface that has been designed to trick, manipulate and deceive users into acting a certain way in which they wouldn’t have, for the benefit of the business. A few common examples of ‘dark patterns’ are spam mailing, confirm shaming, nudging, roach motel, etc. \n\nDark patterns are mainly approached as a cause of concern in regards to privacy. However, a few of the above-mentioned examples (i.e., roach motel and confirm shaming) show the flip side of the coin i.e. the antitrust concern. This article delves into the antitrust concerns regarding ‘dark patterns’ and how the lack of data protection laws in India should not hinder the Competition  Commission of India (CCI) in regulating and scrutinizing dark patterns.\n\nDark Patterns: An Antitrust Concern\n\nDark patterns in regards to data privacy breach means that the user’s consent to using his personal data is not obtained in a free, unambiguous, and informed way. Therefore, obtaining consent through force invalidates the same. An example of a breach is when the user forcefully consents to provide personal data for the unwanted data processing operation because refusing to consent was not an option. \n\nOn the other hand, in regards to antitrust, the breach is said to happen when the practice of an entity is found to be anticompetitive. Anti-competitive practice is an act done to restrict effective competition in order to sustain or increase their own market share and profit without necessarily increasing the quality or reducing the price. This definition can adequately support dark patterns as an anti-competitive practice as it tends to profit through relevant data taken from customers through one of the many dark pattern practices.\n\nFirms, especially tech-firms, can use these dark patterns to “(i) exclude competition in digital markets; and then (ii) based on their market power, extract resources akin to restricting output in product markets”.\n\nAmazon, for example, displays the information on the number of stocks left for the product that one is currently viewing on its website. It is known as ‘scarcity bias’. It tends to emotionally nudge the customer into buying that product that he would not have bought otherwise. In another instance, Spotify indulges in dark patterns through the ‘roach motel’ technique which makes the process of opting out of a subscription hard and cumbersome thus increasing the chance of a continued subscription. \n\nWhen consumers are forced to use a platform exclusively because their attention is limited, digital manipulation can create barriers to entry that keep upstarts out. This keeps people on a platform even when better user interfaces are available. The example of Amazon’s ‘scarcity bias tactics’ aims to exploit the finite users by coercing them into ordering the product quickly without looking for other alternative platforms.\n\nThe anti-competitiveness can be argued through the potential harm that dark patterns cause the consumers. Dark patterns can be used to fleece revenue from users; and also quietly manipulate customers in a way that degrades the quality of the market. The lengthy process of unsubscribing to Spotify premium services extracts the money from users which otherwise would not have been possible to be tapped by Spotify.\n\nThe quiet manipulation of using inferior quality products reduces the overall welfare of the customers in a market and hence causes a ‘non-price injury’. In Tucker v. Apple, the US court acknowledged both price and non-price injury caused by digital manipulation. Further in United States v. Microsoft, the court ruled Microsoft’s conduct as anticompetitive by restricting competition and coercing users through its product design by integrating Internet Explorer, which was deemed to be of inferior quality, into Windows.\n\nIn short, the above-mentioned examples of dark patterns misdirect and manipulate the consumers to modify their actions in a way that is advantageous and profitable to the business, thus, impeding fair and effective competition. The limitation that needs to be kept in mind is that the difficulty in establishing a line between creative marketing and dark patterns is hard. While not all dark patterns are detrimental, the critical factor is if the design was intended to increase reliance, influence usage, and provide consumers with a product of inferior quality.\n\nCurrent Indian Competition Law Jurisprudence\n\nThe Competition Act, 2002 (the Act) was introduced with the objective of promoting fair competition while regulating any anticompetitive practices in the market. Section 4 of the Act provides for the regulation of entities that abuse their dominant position in the relevant market. Now, the traditional approach to this provision was to hold entities accountable on the basis of pricing, hence making it an important parameter for CCI to exercise its jurisdiction. The famous case of WhatsApp Privacy Policy update in 2016 (WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update (2016)) is a prime example of this approach. CCI refused to entertain its jurisdiction on WhatsApp which was alleged to abuse its dominant position, for profit, by forcing users to share data with ‘Facebook’ in order to use WhatsApp. Therefore, the case was dismissed on the basis that there was no act of predatory pricing found in its practices even when there was a misappropriation of data having the potential to hamper effective competition.\n\nLater in 2021, CCI’s suo moto case of In Re: Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Users (WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update (2021)) hinted at a shift from this traditional approach. The CCI ordered the DG to investigate the prima facie contravention of Section 4 of the Act as WhatsApp showed ‘exploitative and exclusionary’ conduct by obtaining consent from customers to share their data with Facebook companies; which was alleged to be unnecessary for availing WhatsApp services. \n\nThis deviation in approach could be traced back to a market study on the telecom sector released by the CCI. The study indicated CCI’s increased cognizance of “privacy taking the form of non-price competition”. It further acknowledged the detriment to the competition and consumers caused when data privacy is breached. \n US' and EU's Take on Dark Patterns\n\nCases like the WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update (2016) and the WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update (2021) provide opportunities for the Indian competition jurisprudence to evolve by looking into anti-competitive practices through data privacy breaches. However, the absence of well-framed data privacy law provokes confusion and uncertainty as to the extent to which CCI can entertain its jurisdiction in a data privacy breach case. \n\nIn jurisdictions such as the EU and the US, there are data privacy laws and guidelines that seek to acknowledge and regulate dark patterns. The researchers found that ‘dark patterns were harmful and required close supervision by the watchdog. For instance, France’s data protection authority had stated that dark patterns render the user’s consent invalid as it is “using and abusing a strategy to divert attention.” Moreover, the European Data Protection Board had recently published guidelines on dark patterns in social media platforms and how certain practices could contravene the provisions under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. \n\nSimilarly, California Consumer Privacy Act’s objective revolves around enforcing transparent and voluntary conduct of obtaining consent. Furthermore, the upcoming California Privacy Rights Act explicitly deals with dark patterns hence strengthening enforcement against it. The U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner, Rohit Chopra, referred to dark patterns as “often harmful to users or contrary to their intent” and stated that the Federal Trade Commission should “methodically use all its tools to shine a light on unlawful digital dark patterns, and contain the spread of this popular, profitable, and problematic business practice.”\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that both the jurisprudences have taken cognizance of the harmful effects of dark patterns, meanwhile, India still does not have a data protection law on its own to regulate the usage of data; let alone deter dark patterns. This is where the competition law authorities should not hesitate in regulating dark patterns which may fall under the ambit of antitrust laws. Simply stating, CCI’s lack of jurisdiction in data and privacy matters will only continue to widen the loopholes in the legislation. Besides, the CCI has signaled a fresh approach towards non-price competitions. Therefore, if the anti-competitiveness of dark patterns can be proved by CCI, it should not hesitate to scrutinize the same citing its lack of jurisdiction in data and privacy matters. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn sum, the non-availability of data protection law should not cause reluctance in CCI to scrutinize dark patterns under antitrust concerns. CCI should continue to take up jurisdiction as it did in the 2021 case because data is knowledge, and knowledge is power. Companies will strive to leverage this power towards themselves; and through anticompetitive practices, if needed. Thus, it is high time that CCI started to acknowledge data privacy as means of non-price competition and dark patterns as an anticompetitive practice because both consumer welfare and effective competition are ultimately eroded. Nevertheless, in the longer run, a data protection law is needed to address the aspect of consumer privacy violations.\nCompetitionCompetition ActDark PatternsCCIPrivacy\nCompetition Law\n541 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Role of Regulators: An Analysis in the Light of Reliance Industries Limited v. SEBI",
        "content": "Mahadev Nair\nSep 4, 2022\n5 min read\nRole of Regulators: An Analysis in the Light of Reliance Industries Limited v. SEBI\n[Mahadev is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nRegulation of markets of any kind is a very tricky affair. Securities markets are no different. A laissez-faire market approach can manifest in under-regulation – leading to illegal practices such as securities fraud and insider trading, etc. On the other hand, an over-regulated and constrictive market would make investors uninterested and hesitant in investing in the securities market. The challenge, therefore, lies in striking a balance between securities market regulation and activity. It is the job of the government, the regulator, i.e., the Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) in India, and, to some extent, even the judiciary to ensure this balance is preserved and sustained. It is through the sustenance of this balance that a country can grow leaps and bounds economically. \n\nIn India, the regulator of stock markets, i.e., SEBI, has been given much-needed autonomy and authority to handle matters relating to the security markets to protect the investors and engage in market development and regulation. Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 (SEBI Act), SEBI has been given widespread powers. However, such powers can have an adverse effect if exercised unfairly, as it can stifle the involvement and activity of market participants. However, the Supreme Court of India (SC) and the High Courts often keep a check on such practices when such matters are brought to their notice. A case in point is the SC’s ruling in Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) v. SEBI, wherein the SC observed that a regulator must act fairly. \n\nThis article discusses the facts and the ruling in the case, along with its wider implications on understanding the SEBI’s role and functions. \n\nFacts\n\nThe moot issue, in this case, dates to 1994 and is concerned with some share transactions carried out by RIL pertaining to \"fraudulent allotment of equity shares to promoters and group companies\". Reliance had requested for disclosure of certain internal documents in possession of SEBI, including the opinions of the former SC judge Justice BN Srikrishna and a chartered accountant. \n\nWhen SEBI denied this request, RIL filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court (Bombay HC). This was dismissed in 2019. SEBI lodged a criminal complaint before Special Judge, Mumbai against RIL for offences under the SEBI Act and other relevant regulations. The complaint was rejected, and thereafter a revision petition was filed in the Bombay HC. Reliance filed an interlocutory application praying for disclosure of the above-mentioned documents on 28 March 2022. The Bombay HC adjourned this application stating that it can be considered along with the main revision petition. Hence, a special leave petition was filed before the SC.\n\nAnalysis by SC\n\nThe SC laid down that since SEBI is a regulator, it owes the duty to act fairly while it conducts its proceedings or initiates any actions against parties. SEBI is an institute that is quasi-judicial in nature, and because of this, SEBI is constitutionally mandated to act in a fair manner that aligns with the rules given under the law. A regulator is dutybound to deal with issues instead of finding means to get around the rule of law to nail successful convictions. This duty is tied crucially and inseparably with the principles of natural justice, according to which a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to defend its case. \n\nThe hesitation by SEBI to disclose such documents raises eyebrows about the fairness and transparency of the trial. Such practices taint the trials with prejudice and partiality. The SC said, “opaqueness is antithetical to “transparency.” In a country that is based on the rule of law, institutions must compulsorily adopt procedures that back the \"democratic principles\" of accountability and transparency.\n\nAnother important aspect of this judgment was that the SC added a word of caution against initiating frivolous criminal litigation against large corporations. The SC held that initiation of such criminal proceedings in commercial matters must be done after a lot of circumspection, and the courts must act as \"gatekeepers\" in such matters. The reasoning given by the SC behind this word of caution was that such criminal actions would lead to adverse economic consequences for the nation over a more extended period. Hence, the regulator must exercise caution before initiating such actions.\n\nImplications of the Decision\n\nThis decision passed by the SC is one in the right direction as it is an indication of the attitude of the SC that balance must be maintained in the regulation of various players in any market and that all the regulators must exercise their powers cautiously in a manner not obstructive to the freedom and flexibility envisaged by the law of the land. This decision also comes in line with other decisions passed by the SC, such as Swadesi Cotton Mills v. Union of India, wherein it was held that “irrespective of whether the power conferred on a statutory body or tribunal is administrative or quasi-judicial, a duty to act fairly, that is in consonance with the fundamental principles of substantive justice is generally implied, because the presumption is that in a democratic polity wedded to the rule of law, the State or the Legislature does not intend that in the exercise of their statutory powers its functionaries should act unfairly or unjustly.\" The above case was also referred to by SEBI in Shri D.A Gadgil v. SEBI and Others, which is an encouraging sign for all the players in the market as it shows the attitude of SEBI favouring fairness.\n\nIf the legal landscape of a country is such that corporations would feel a lack of freedom to carry out ventures due to harsh consequences such as criminal cases, then it would eventually create a trend where no more investments would be attracted. Such a result would be disastrous to the economy of a country. The fear of frivolous criminal proceedings (or any such draconian measures, for that matter) against a corporation would create an environment where corporations would eventually stop investing more money, which could lead to collateral issues like unemployment and whatnot, especially in a country with an enormous population like India.\n\nSEBI as an institution has been given wide powers under the SEBI Act, and rightly so, considering the various scams that have happened in the past, which have had gruesome on various investors, the stock market, and the economy. Hence, a regulator like SEBI is very much necessary. However, such vast powers can turn out to be risky for the economy if they are too restrictive or if the regulator abuses such powers. Naturally, companies and other players in a market would be apprehensive about the possible consequences of their decisions. If the deterrence caused by the regulator's power goes beyond a certain level, the balance will be disturbed, and obviously, the economy will suffer.\n\nTherefore, such a decision passed by the SC shows that SEBI and other regulators need to keep their powers in check and must not use them at their whims and fancies. As stated above, transparency and fairness must be the cornerstone of any action taken by SEBI. As much as it is the role of SEBI to prevent any wrongdoings in the security market, it is also SEBI's imperative to do so within the principles of natural justice also and while ensuring the welfare of the securities market, which has a massive impact on the economy of the country itself. These duties and these rationales apply to all regulators, too, as the judgment discussed above talks about regulators in general and not SEBI individually.\nSEBIRILSEBI ActSecurities Market\nCorporate Law\n282 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "SEBI’s Perplexing Take on Open Offer Mandate for Indirect Acquisitions",
        "content": "Ishaan Saraswat, Avinash Kotval\nSep 3, 2022\n5 min read\nSEBI’s Perplexing Take on Open Offer Mandate for Indirect Acquisitions\n[Ishaan and Avinash are students at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011 (Takeover Code) categorises acquisitions into two viz. direct and indirect acquisitions. Regulation 4 of the Takeover Code mandates that the acquirer give an open offer to the existing shareholders. This is done in order for the acquirer to attain control over the target company (TC), irrespective of whether it is acquired directly or indirectly.  \n\nNevertheless, the Takeover Code contains certain general exemptions from this mandate under Regulation 10. The relevant exemption for this article is Regulation 10(1)(a)(ii), which removes the obligation to give an open offer if the acquisition is an inter se transfer amongst qualifying persons (the qualifying persons being promoters in the TC) and if the same has been disclosed to be in that capacity to the stock exchange for at least three years (promoter exemption). \n\nOverview of the Issue\n\nOn 6 March 2018, SEBI provided an informal guidance to Navkar Builders Limited (Navkar). Navkar Builders Limited, the TC, had sought guidance regarding two transactions that were to take place. The promoter group of the TC entailed two natural persons, Dakshesh Shah and Samir Patel, and an artificial entity, Navkar Fiscal Services Pvt. Ltd (NFSPL). All three had been disclosed as promoters in the TC for at least three years. \n\nThe three parties collectively had 39.94% shareholding in the TC, with Dakshesh Shah having 6.65%, Samir Patel having 4.46%, and NFSPL having 28.82%. The first transaction was NFSPL acquiring shares of Samir Patel in the TC. This would not affect Dakshesh Shah but would increase NFSPL’s shareholding to 33.29%. SEBI did not mandate an open offer here because it matches the requirements of the promoter exemption. \n\nThe second transaction is the bone of contention for this paper. This transaction is the transfer of shares between the promoters of NFSPL itself. NFSPL only had two shareholders – Dakshesh Shah and Samir Patel, with no change in such shareholding pattern between the two for more than three years. Dakshesh Shah held 50.05% of NFSPL, while Samir Patel held 49.95% of the shareholding. The transaction entailed Samir Patel transferring 49.45% of his shareholding in NFSPL to Dakshesh Shah and 0.50% to Dakshesh Shah’s wife. This gives Dakshesh Shah massive control of NFSPL, which in turn has control over the TC. This would amount to an indirect acquisition of the TC by Dakshesh Shah. \n\nSEBI acknowledged that this was an indirect acquisition pursuant to an inter se transfer between the promoters of NFSPL. Regardless, SEBI mandated an open offer to the shareholders of the TC because the promoter shareholding of NFSPL was not disclosed to the stock exchange, hence failing the requirements of the promoter exemption under the takeover code. \n\nThere are two issues arising here, first regarding the disclosures to be made by a private company, and second whether the disclosures required under the Takeover Code are regarding the promoters of the TC, if such promoters are juridical persons.\n\nMuddy Waters\n\nThe informal guidance stipulated that TC’s promoters, Dakshesh Shah and Samir Patel, were not disclosed as promoters of NFSPL as well to the stock exchange. When it comes to disclosing promoters in the shareholding pattern, the obligation is present under Regulation 31(4) of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (LODR). This obligation pertains to public companies. Per the facts of the case, such disclosures were made regarding the TC, a public company. \n\nIt would be odd to have the public company obligations under LODR imposed on a private company. The new disclosure format does not mandate private companies to provide such information. In the present case, the guidance has the effect of selectively extending the application of LODR to private companies as well. SEBI has no discernible rationale to support this position. \n\nFurther, the informal guidance stated that NFSPL’s promoters were disclosed only as the promoters of the TC and not as promoters of NFSPL to the stock exchange. The promoter exemption’s wording states that the persons should be named as the “promoters in the shareholding pattern filed by the target company”. There is no requirement under the takeover code to be disclosed as the promoter of a promoter company of the TC. \n\nIn the Matter of M/s. SH Kelkar and Company Limited (Kelkar), the fact pattern was similar to Navkar’s. Here, the shareholding of the promoter company (again a private company) was being transferred to a trust, by way of which the trust indirectly acquired the TC. The question was whether the promoter exemption would apply. The court concluded that the trust was not named as a promoter of the TC for at least three years and, therefore, would not be exempted. Accordingly, there was no question of who was disclosed as the promoter of the private company whose shareholding was being transferred. Here, we see that the court only looked at the textual requirements of Regulation 10(1)(a)(ii) and did not lift the corporate veil of the promoter. They only looked at whether the entity was listed as a promoter for the exception to apply. This point on leaving the corporate veil untouched is central to the point of this article.\n\nReluctance to Raise the Veil\n\nPer Laurel Energetics Private Limited v. SEBI (Laurel Energetics), Regulation 10(1) makes it impermissible for the court to lift the corporate veil, either partially or otherwise, in a manner that would distort the plain language of the regulation. The court opined that for where the corporate veil is to be lifted, the regulation itself would expressly state it. Accordingly, per the court, the literal language of Regulation 10 was clear and beyond any iota of doubt; hence, there should be no need to go to the objective of the regulation.\n\nSimply put, in this informal guidance, the transaction entailed a promoter exercising control in a promoter company. All in all, the control over the TC remains within the original promoter group. Applying purposive interpretation as provided for in K. Sreenivasa Rao v. Regional Director, SEBI (Sreenivasa Rao), the objective of the Takeover Code in mandating an open offer is to allow the other shareholders to make their choice to stick with the company after a possible transfer of control to third parties. There was no such situation warranting an open offer in the informal guidance. \n\nTherefore, the promoter exemption makes it clear that the promoters to be disclosed are the ones of the TC. The Takeover Code is not allowing any room for additional obligations, especially that of a private company. In this regard, the informal guidance in question obfuscates the interpretation of the general exemption. Further, looking at Kelkar, Laurel Energetics and Sreenivasa Rao, it is important to note that the SEBI takes a very different position with respect to disclosures of promoter patterns as opposed to the aforementioned cases.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe essence of this article pertains to the reliance that the SEBI has placed on ‘informal guidance’. Informal guidance on a matter that has such far-reach consequences on the functioning of a company, as was in Navkar, would set a dangerous precedent for the manner in which such a statutory body operates. The informal guidance in Navkar had the effect of requiring the company to initiate an open offer for the remaining shareholders, even though the promoters were arguably operating within the textual requirements of Regulation 10(1)(a)(ii). \n\nOpen offer requirements take time and money to implement, which can be a genuine bottleneck in time-sensitive arrangements. More importantly, utilising such informal guidance as the letter of the law can lead to a lack of clarity in what the applicable law is and would not form part of a coherent legal system. The lack of clarity is compounded in situations where promoters of a company are juridical entities themselves. Any disclosures pertaining to such promoting entities would amount to lifting the corporate veil, which, based on common law jurisprudence, cannot be done unless on the grounds of illegality or public interest. Any guidance on disclosures vis-à-vis the promoter patterns of juridical entities acting as promoter companies should be officially notified. \nOpen OfferSEBITakeover CodeAcquirerTarget\nCorporate Law\n821 views\n32 likes.

        "title": "To Break Up or Not: Unfolding the Cross-Border Demerger Conundrum In India",
        "content": "Ishaan Saraswat\nAug 21, 2022\n6 min read\nTo Break Up or Not: Unfolding the Cross-Border Demerger Conundrum In India\n[Ishaan is a student at Jindal Global Law School. The following post has been authored by him with inputs from Prof. Sakshat Bansal at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nOn 31 October 2018, the NCLT Ahmedabad bench (NCLT Ahmedabad Bench) allowed an inbound demerger and transfer of a foreign undertaking with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Inbound Demerger Case). In the very next year, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench, refused Sun Pharma’s application for an outbound demerger since the Companies Act 2013 (CA 2013) did not expressly provide for ‘demergers’ (Outbound Demerger Case). \n\nThe NCLT Ahmedabad Bench’s  judgment in the Outbound Demerger Case hinges on two folds. Firstly, the  NCLT Ahmedabad Bench reasoned that while under Sections 230 and 232 demergers are encapsulated by the terms ‘compromise’ and ‘arrangements’, Section 234 of the CA 2013 does not give reference to either ‘demergers’, ‘compromise’, or even ‘arrangement’. To buttress this, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench also added that neither does Rule 25A of Companies (Compromises, Arrangements, and Amalgamations) Rules 2017 (Compromise, Arrangements, and Amalgamation Rules) (the rule corresponding to Section 234) mention either of these terms. \n\nSecondly, the  NCLT Ahmedabad Bench also opined that a ‘cross border merger’ in the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Draft Regulations 2017 (Draft FEMA Merger Regulations) was defined as “any merger, demerger, amalgamation or arrangement between Indian company(ies) and foreign company(ies) in accordance with Companies (Compromises, Arrangements, and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016”. However, when the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations 2018 (FEMA Merger Regulations) were finally notified, ‘demerger’ was removed from this definition, the corollary being that cross-border demergers are not governed by the regulations.  \n\nCritical Analysis of the Opposing Judgments in Question\n\nWith respect to the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench’s construction of the silence on ‘demerger’ under Section 234 and the Compromise, Arrangements, and Amalgamation Rules as prohibition, this article would like to emphasize the rationale given by the same bench in the Inbound Demerger Case. In that order, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench  had reasoned that Section 232(b) of CA 2013 provided that an undertaking being transferred could be “whole, or any part of the undertaking”, which in its opinion is a demerger. The NCLT Ahmedabad Bench concluded that since Section 232 is titled ‘Merger and Amalgamation’, this phrase would include demergers too by virtue of the provision’s content. The view that demergers are possible under Sections 230 and 232 has also been taken by other benches. Subsequently, according to the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench, since Section 234(1) stipulates that the section shall apply “mutatis mutandis to the schemes of mergers and amalgamations”, it would include Section 232’s understanding and hence include demergers as well. \n\nEssentially, the position of law is that if the letter of the law is capable of being given an alternate meaning, then that must be done by the court; however, if the same is not possible, only then must the ordinary rule of literal interpretation be adopted. The Inbound Demerger Case subscribed to this principle of interpretation by adopting the term ‘demerger’ alternatively for ‘merger and amalgamation’. The Outbound Demerger Case, however, did not seek for an alternate meaning, but rather,  proceeded to adopt the literal construction of Section 234. \n\nFurther, the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations 2018 (FEMA Merger Regulations) removed the word ‘demerger’, contrasted with its inclusion under the draft FEMA Merger Regulations. However, it may be noted that in the Outbound Demerger Case, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench initially reasoned that ‘arrangements’ and ‘compromises’ under Sections 230 and 232 of CA 2013 included demergers. Interestingly, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench did not deploy this construction whilst observing the FEMA Merger Regulations. The FEMA Merger Regulations still define a ‘cross border merger’ as “any merger, amalgamation or arrangement between an Indian company and foreign company in accordance with Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamation) Rules, 2016 notified under the Companies Act, 2013.” While it is arguable that the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench failed to recognize this, demergers can, hence, still be read into the term ‘arrangements’ under Regulation 2(iii) the FEMA Merger Regulations. \n\nLastly, the removal of the term ‘demerger’ from the definition cannot lead to the conclusion that the FEMA Merger Regulations cannot govern the transaction. The process laid down in the regulations regarding inbound and outbound transactions as was present in the Draft FEMA Regulations still remains. Moreover, in the Outbound Demerger Case itself, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench acknowledged that the Reserve Bank of India had approved the cross-border demerger. Hence, a presumption by the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench that the FEMA Merger Regulations do not allow such a transaction would be fallacious. Again, the Inbound Demerger Case fortifies this rationale that cross-border demergers are within the confines of the law.\n\nA Departure from CA 2013\n\nIt may be noted that Section 394(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1956 (Old Act) stated that “a part of the undertaking of any transferor company may be transferred to a transferee company”, where a transferee company as per Section 394(4)(b) refers to an Indian company, i.e., a company within the meaning of the act, while a transferor company includes any body corporate, whether a company under the Old Act or not. Hence, a transferor can be a foreign company too. Essentially, this provides for inbound mergers and demergers but prohibits outbound transactions since the transferee is an Indian entity. \n\nIn the Outbound Demerger Case, the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench acknowledged this and stated that it was very much possible for a foreign company to transfer its undertaking or business to an Indian company under the Old Act, since Section 394 of the Old Act applied to both demergers as well as mergers, which, however, is not possible under Section 234 of CA 2013 since it does not expressly mention ‘demerger’.\n\nTherefore, the rationale that cross-border demergers are not allowed because Section 234 does not mention ‘demerger’, in the context of Section 394 of the Old Act, would result in an incorrect conclusion. This is because Section 394 of the Old Act did not use the term ‘demerger’ either. It simply said that the whole or a part of the business can be transferred, which is also provided by Section 232 of CA 2013, which then applies to Section 234 mutatis mutandis.\n\nWe must also observe the Dr. Jamshed J. Irani Committee’s report (Expert Committee Report) on developing the Old Act in the context of the economic and business environment, and since it played a major role in the formulation of the CA 2013. Per the Expert Committee Report, the committee took the view that the legislation must enable uniformity in pursuance of mergers, demergers, amalgamations, or schemes of reconstruction, to allow Indian firms to be competitive in the restructuring exercise in the global context. The committee also implored the law to be forward-looking and recognize outbound transactions by accepting foreign transferee companies. The decision of the NCLT Ahmedabad Bench in this regard reverses these ideals by altogether barring cross-border, both inbound and outbound demergers.\n\nConcluding Remarks and the Way Forward\n\nThe need for the hour is, therefore, for a policy clarification from the legislature since the judiciary can only either take a textual interpretation or read into the existing black letter – which are both subjective approaches. As per the above analysis, it is evident that demergers are recognized under CA 2013 per Section 232. Further, demergers can also be read into the draft FEMA Merger Regulations under ‘arrangements’. A reference in this respect may be made to other statutes. Section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (IT Act)  gives reference to Section 234 of CA 2013 whilst defining a demerger. Nonetheless, the provision that finally enables the cross-border transaction is Section 234 of CA 2013, which is eerily silent on the possibility of demergers. \n\nThe scenario as is unfolding right now is that the ambiguity is resulting in bottlenecks on investments entering the country (i.e., inbound demergers), and bottlenecks on investments leaving the country (i.e., outbound demergers). Cross-border demergers have the entire regulatory setup available, but the its substantive possibility has become a question mark. Such equivocality reflects instability in dealing with investments, which may be reflected in India’s poor sovereign rating too. The policymakers must be clear on their stance. Countries like the United Kingdom and Singapore expressly bar cross-border demergers, whilst countries like Belgium and Switzerland provide for cross-border demergers by drafting the relevant provisions in an analogous manner to the cross-border merger ones. Only once there is a policy clarification, would India seem like a low-risk country capable of attracting further cross-border M&A activity.\n\nTherefore, there must be an attempt at progressive reform in pursuit of enabling cross-border demergers through regulatory and judicial certainty. From a statutory standpoint, in the Indian scenario, the addition of the term ‘demerger’ to Section 234 of CA 2013 may be a good starting point, since suitable references exist under the FEMA Merger Regulations, the Compromise, Arrangements, and Amalgamation Rules, and the IT Act.\nCross-BorderDemergerCompanies Act\nCorporate Law\n692 views\n19 likes.

        "title": "The Vulnerability in Going Public and the Indispensable Need for ‘Pre-Filing’",
        "content": "Shaurya Singh\nAug 9, 2022\n5 min read\nThe Vulnerability in Going Public and the Indispensable Need for ‘Pre-Filing’\n[Shaurya is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nAn IPO is a door to bring in a substantial amount of capital along with several other opportunities that follow the former. However, due to certain unanticipated circumstances, if the issuer decides to close the door and pull out from the IPO, certain requirements of the procedure which mandate the issuer to disclose key information about the company to the public would affect the issuer regardless. Hence, the situation is a lose-lose for the issuer as it is not only losing the opportunity to raise the capital by pulling out (which usually happens due to an unfavourable event) but also disclosure under The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018 (ICDR Regulations) makes sensitive information about the issuer public, therefore also giving access to its competitors, which can further hurt the issuer. \n\nTo protect the issuers in such a situation, foreign regulators like the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Conduct Authority of the UK have allowed the issuers to pre-file the draft offer document (also known as the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP)) with only the regulatory bodies without making it public during the initial review which eliminates the public accessibility during the period between submission and evaluation of the initial draft. \n\nRecently, the Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) too deliberated with SEBI on the current process of issuance and suggested allowing the pre-filing of the offer document. The Indian capital markets regulator has this reform on its table, so it becomes vital to analyse the issues with the current procedure of issuance and determine the effectiveness of the said reform.\n\nVulnerability of the Issuer\n\nThe ICDR Regulations govern the entire process of an IPO. As of now, the issuer is required to file the DRHP for the initial review with SEBI, while the DRHP will also have to be made available in the public domain including the websites of the stock exchanges, SEBI, issuer, and the merchant bankers. SEBI would then review the DRHP and get back to the entity with approval or comments on the document. SEBI usually takes around 30-90 days to give a nod to the DRHP and allow the issuer to further continue with the succeeding steps of the process. Therefore, even the draft offer document will have to remain in the public domain since the very inception of the regulatory filing process. For instance, the recently listed Campus Activewear received SEBI’s nod after over 2.5 months since it first filed the DRHP on 27 December 2021. Now, this disclosure regulation might not be a problem for a company that eventually gets listed on the exchange. However, the vulnerability of the issuer would truly take its shape when the issuer decides to pull out from the IPO in the period between filling and receiving SEBI’s review. Now, pull-outs at this stage usually happen due to an unprecedented event which is unfruitful or which has a negative impact on the issuing entity. The disclosure would add salt to the wounds of the issuer as the competition would also have the vital data which was disclosed, which may benefit its competition. \n The ICDR Regulations exist to ensure proper disclosure of relevant information to safeguard the investors (and potential investors) while maintaining a fair market environment by ensuring the accessibility of the information. However, it fails to do the same despite making the DRHP public since the very beginning of the process as the red herring prospectus (RHP, the document which contains all the updated information regarding the price and the size of the issue along with the comments received by SEBI after the initial review) stays in the public domain for only 2-5 days before the issue, for a considerably short period of time.\nTherefore, it is pretty evident that there are certain areas the SEBI must focus on and make the necessary changes.\n\nPre-filing of DRHP: A Much Needed Reform\n\nUnlike in a lot of earlier scenarios SEBI, this time is aware of its problem. It did address these issues in a consultation paper- which sought public comments on the introduction of prefilling, released on 11 May 2022. To solve these issues, the paper suggests allowing the pre-filling of the offer document with just the regulatory body without disclosing it to the public. This pre-filing of the offer documents is permitted in foreign jurisdictions like the US, the UK, and Canada where the regulatory authorities review the initial draft offer document, provide their comments, and then if the issuer still is willing to go ahead with the IPO, the document along with the mandated changes is made public. \n\nThe paper also had the framework for incorporating the same in India which was laid out by PMAC:\n\nPMAC suggested that the ‘pre-filing’ of the DRHP shall be allowed without making it public. However, the issuer shall make a public announcement stating that it has commenced the process of an IPO by pre-filing the offer document with SEBI and the stock exchanges. The issuer shall also state that pre-filing of the offer document does not necessarily translate into the issuer actually undertaking the IPO. The issuer and the book running lead managers are also required to submit an undertaking stating that they won't indulge in any sort of marketing/campaign for the IPO at this stage. \nAfter receiving SEBI’s in-principle approval and the observations on the DRHP, the issuer can further proceed with the process if it desires to. The issuer shall now file an updated version of the DRHP with the mandated changes, which is to be referred to as UDRHP-I (a public document). The UDHRP-I has to be made public for at least 21 days on the websites of SEBI, stock exchanges, issuer, and the lead managers for public comments, and only after this stage, the issuer and the lead managers can commence the campaigning for the IPO.\nAfter the 21-day period expires the issuer is required to file the details of the received comments with SEBI. If certain changes are made to the document at this stage either due to public comments or to meet regulatory requirements, then it shall be named UDRHP-II and submitted to SEBI. The issuer shall then proceed further with the regular filing procedure  (file the RHP, a public document, with the Registrar of Companies, the stock exchanges, and SEBI) once SEBI takes note of alterations in the UDRHP-II.\nThis framework by PMAC directly solves the core issue of the issuer by allowing pre-filing and would alter Part VI: Disclosures in and Filing of Offer Documents of the ICDR Regulations. However, it does not explicitly solve the problem of accessibility of the RHP. While it does mention a 21-day period for the UDRHP-I,  that document lacks a lot of relevant information which is usually present only in the RHP, especially regarding the price of the issue and the latest financial data. Therefore, a minimum time period between the filing of RHP and the opening of the issue must be prescribed so that enough time is provided for the RHP to be consumed.  \n\nConclusion \n\nThe Indian capital market is one of the biggest in the world; with huge domestic and foreign inflows, it can prove to be a gateway to tremendous opportunities. However, in order to allow the entities to fully capitalise on these opportunities, it is important to acknowledge the issues with the current set of regulations and act accordingly. The regulator has acknowledged the issue already, and now is the time to act on the same and bring the desired reforms as suggested by the PMAC and also mandate a minimum time period after which the issue could open once the RHP is filed. These reforms would not only safeguard the issuers and their investors but will also eliminate a further deterrence in the minds of potential issuing entities from pursuing an IPO when the short-term market conditions are uncertain.\nPMACICDRIPOPre-Filing\nCorporate Law\n543 views\n18 likes.

        "content": "Sneha Rath\nAug 6, 2022\n6 min read\nScope of NFTs in the Real Estate Industry: Need for a Better Regulation of NFTs? Part II\n[Sneha is a student at National Law University, Odisha. The following post is the second part of the two-part article, the first one being available here.]\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are risky investments because they have been frequently subject to the “pump and dump” schemes in the digital world, similar to a practice in the stock markets which is considered illegal. The pump and dump scheme in the crypto world is a practice wherein crypto investors release misleading information that results in raising the price of a currency post which the same is sold at a profit. Essentially, the investors are pulled first and it is projected as if the value of the stock/currency is soaring and then when the same falls, these investors sell it at a profit, resulting in loss to the other investors. Therefore, since prices can be artificially inflated, investment in NFTs poses risk to retail investors.  \n\nFurther, transactions are carried out in a decentralized network, meaning although the transactions are linked to the online identity of the user in the NFT ledger, it often becomes difficult to track the physical location, nationality and real identity of the user in such cases.  Most transactions involving NFTs are done with crypto wallets i.e., digital wallets holding crypto currencies. However, some recent incidents of crypto thefts and frauds have posed questions on the security and safety of using such crypto wallets. Data has revealed that the latest crypto fraud unearthed in 2022 was that of Morris Coin wherein a website had lured over 900 investors to invest INR 1,200 crore in a fake crypto currency i.e., Morris Coin. Thus, using crypto currencies and crypto wallets for purchasing NFTs will further exacerbate the incidents of Crypto frauds/ Stealing from Crypto wallets. \n\nNFTs are digital tokens that may be subject to copyright law, and through digital rights management (DRM) the rights of the ownership of an NFT can be easily protected. However, it has been speculated that such rights i.e., DRM of the ownership of the digital asset has led to the concentration of powers in the hands of the publisher, limited consumption of the product/token due to ownership rights, and possible monitoring of user activity. While DRM has been identified as a protector of creative works of digital artwork like the NFTs and crypto assets, such limitations have resulted in creating barriers to their entry in the market. Now, money is considered a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account in the world of finance. Money, in most of the countries including India, is held by government/government authorized entities like RBI in the case of India and such authority regulates the way money is supposed to flow in the market. The authorized entities enable payment of money through means such as banks, credit cards, payment wallets, which are in turn licensed by the government to carry out such transactions. This centralized system of regulating the flow of money in the economy is very different from the way cryptocurrencies are used as digital currencies for making payments. There is no centralized authority at present that regulates or recognizes the legal tender of NFTs or cryptocurrencies and thus there is no sovereign guarantee for such assets. This including the speculative nature of the digital assets which bear high risks due to their high volatility in the market ultimately puts the consumers at a disadvantageous position. \n\nGiven this understanding, it is imperative to suggest that it is high time for the Government of India to take reference from countries like Japan and the United States where payment using digital currencies has been allowed subject to their licensing, and introduce laws that can better regulate the use of digital assets in different industries.\n\nAnalyzing the Scope of NFTs in the Real Estate Industry\n\nOne of the most active industries in the market is that of real estate. However, it is also one of the most unorganized sectors. Although we have made significant progress in digitisation of ownership records and maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, we’re still far from complete digitisation of the whole process. The current dependence on the offline process involving paperwork and frequent visits to government offices not only delays the whole process, but also increases the chances of corruption, tax avoidance and other malpractices. \n\nWhile numerous attempts have been made to switch to a digital-only mode, it has still not been completely successful as there is no proper way of maintaining a real-time ledger of transaction history, ownership and change in ownership of properties. \n\nUse of NFTs and blockchain for real estate transactions will reduce the possibility of fraud, errors and risks along with eliminating the need of middlemen or brokers. It will also make the process significantly quicker, enabling the seller and the buyer to save time as well as money. In high valued properties with high price sensitivity, the ability to close the transaction in a matter of a few minutes can benefit the investors in case the price increases due to speculation. Transparency and ease of purchasing will also garner interest from more buyers, especially from first-time buyers. While India is still opening up to the concept of fractional ownership of real estate for investment, NFTs can speed up its adoption, especially among the younger generation. With NFTs, parties who own a fraction of the property can easily prove their ownership and transfer the same without having to sell the entire property. The flexibility provided by NFTs in such cases will not only boost investor confidence, but also allow entry of more retail investors into a sector which has so far been dominated by institutional investors.\n\nApart from the key role that NFTs can play in the entire process of physical real estate management, it has also been observed that NFTs have significantly impacted the metaverse of real estate properties. It all started with the onset of the COVID-19 in 2020 which forced people to distance themselves from the physical world, eventually resulting in tech enthusiasts exploring the digital world by investing in metaverses. Real estate became one of the sought after industries; one such example is the creation of The Mars House by Krista Kim in 2021, which was made open to people for a virtual tour of the property for $200 per ticket with an option to rent the property for [virtual] wedding functions and other parties/social events of the people.\n\nThe disruption caused by the NFTs in the digital world may seem uncanny, especially because the risk in investing virtual currencies lacking government backing/legal tender is very high. However, it could be said that just like in the case social media platforms which were once branded as fad are now the most operated platforms, the metaverses of real estate properties may also boom in the future. \n\nAs such virtual property i.e., real estate NFTs aren’t that different from physical property except that the former can only be perceived by our eyesight but the same cannot be physically experienced. People have been using virtual real estate properties to design their interiors, socialize with people, organize parties and many more such events. Thus, in terms of investment planning, a diverse investment portfolio can be followed in metaverse real estate properties similar to what is done in a real-world real estate management. A diverse investment portfolio is basically a strategic financial planning in real estate properties where the investor/investing party follows an approach whereby a diversified portfolio is created to make money. Essentially, the parties do not invest in just one stock but instead categorically spread their investments in different stocks, companies, bonds, etc. This helps in minimizing the ripple effect that may be created due to any of the investments suffering loss in the market. Further, due to scarcity i.e. limited acres of land, the real-estate properties in the metaverse are heavily priced (inclusive of mortgages with interest rates). However, the scope for renting of properties in the metaverse can help people recover their expenses as well as earn a good income out of it.\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnology is revolutionizing every industry, and real estate is just one of them. Being one of the most active and longest-standing industries, investments in real estate properties are bound to grow in the coming years. NFTs are making things possible which could have never been otherwise possible. People are exploring tech-driven methods to expand their horizons of financial investment and social interaction. NFTs will be a game changer for fractional owners of real estate for investment purposes too, as established earlier. Blockchain technology will help maintain transaction records and further aid in reducing disputes in ownership. \n\nMoreover, NFTs are a certificate of ownership in assets; it is distinct from the existence of the assets per se. Therefore, given the rapid development that is happening with the scope of the use of digital assets, it is important that the Indian authorities take active efforts to effectively regulate the use of digital technologies, be it the NFTs or crypto currencies. Strengthening the regulatory framework will help ascertain the source and operability of such digital assets which are also susceptible to illegal activities such as money laundering, and many more as has been discussed earlier in this paper.\nNFTCryptocurrencyFinance BillReal Estate\nCorporate Law\n115 views\n1 like.

Part I\n[Sneha is a student at National Law University, Odisha. The following post is the first part of the two-part article, the second one being available here.]\n\nWith the presentation of the Finance Bill 2022, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a  major development with respect to the regulation of digital currencies in India, stating that “Income from the transfer of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens will be taxed at the rate of 30%. Any loss incurred from such transfers cannot be set off against any other income or carried forward to subsequent years.” Further, it was stated that the tax deducted at source (TDS) will be charged at 1% for any payments made on the transfer of digital assets. However, there is a divided opinion in the market with regard to the legality of trading in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies in India. Some are of the view that by taxing the NFTs and cryptocurrencies, the government has provided legal status to their existence, while others are of the opinion that mere taxation of the returns from trading in the digital assets does not necessarily confirm their legal status in the financial market. Furthermore, while some view cryptocurrencies as belonging to the asset category, others do not quite agree. Moreover, the Financial Bill 2022 has classified crypto assets to be taxed and surcharges to be levied on the same in the manner similar to how winnings and speculative transactions are treated under the Income Tax Act 1961 (IT Act). In any case, the      IT Act is not concerned with the nature of the manner or means of acquiring the income (i.e., whether illegal or legal source), and therefore the taxation of returns from cryptocurrencies or NFTs does not confirm the legal status of such digital currencies. In current times, it has become important to study the nature of the NFTs and cryptocurrencies because of a two-fold reason: the nature of every digital asset particularly cryptocurrencies and NFTs is different from one another, and there is no definite regulatory framework governing the same. \nThis post has been divided into two parts wherein the first part aims to cover the nature and scope of NFT and crypto usage in the real estate industry through judicial rulings and market trends. The second part presents a perspective on whether regulatory frameworks should be strengthened for their governance in the Indian financial market, through the lens of the practical functioning of the real estate industry.\n\nOverview of the Nature of Cryptocurrencies and NFTs\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is fungible, meaning one type of cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another. Unlike currencies that are regulated by a central authority and are therefore legal tenders, cryptocurrencies are free from such regulation. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology which is a decentralized and trustless data storage protocol, to create unique assets and bring it to the art business’. Crypto collectibles on a blockchain are unique creatures (in the form of images, art, etc.) that may help trace the cryptocurrencies to the rightful owner for every transaction that is made on the blockchain platform. Alternatively, NFTs are non-interchangeable (alternatively known as non-fungible) units of data, which are stored on a blockchain, in the form of a digital ledger, and can be sold and traded in the market in its digital form. As metadata is known to provide information/data describing what the data is (i.e., data about the data), the NFT metadata facilitates information about the content stored on the blockchain is being continuously used to represent different types of assets (in various forms like digital, real, etc.). Developers have the power to limit the number of items, and technology helps to prove one’s ownership. Overall, NFT’s ledger system is beneficial in fraud prevention as it helps in certifying the owner of the digital asset.\n\nTracing the Market Trend on the Use of NFTs\n\nNFTs offers several opportunities to monetize a wide spectrum of assets. The real-world artworks are tokenized to promote authenticity and offer ownership to the artist in artwork and pictures.       The in-game elements or items are allowed to be tokenized and exchanged with other partners in the gaming/sporting events. For collectibles, various unique features like algorithms and value-added features to identify are possible through NFTs. For articles and news posts, licenses, and certifications to authenticate and preserve the ownership of documentation is tokenized. In Sports, game tickets issued on hyper ledger platforms can be tokenized to prevent counterfeit merchandise. Crypto addresses are offered as NFTs where users can buy and sell crypto name services. Virtual assets like virtual land and various virtual world elements can be owned, created, and monetized too. \n\nSome of the recent usages of an NFT in various industries are as follows: Marvel released their NFTs with an image of the powerful Iron Man and the Avengers Logo; AT&T Software is offering high quality NFT marketplace to its customers; Weaver Labs is converting physical assets into NFTs designated to its owner enabling telecom network providers to mount antennas on top of buildings, traffic lights or streetlights; Nonvoice a leading 5G app agency has launched Authentic Digital Collectibles (ADC) as NFTs in Thailand. Experts from consultancy. Additionally, there are  sector-specific and service-specific NFT opportunities worth exploring, such as the below: \nDigital content distribution: Piracy is a major concern in modern internet space that can be overcome using digital ownership, so that content can be traced to the course. \nLot allotment via NFTs: With the chip shortage affecting consumers worldwide, scalping can be tackled by making every order using NFTs which results in fair distribution.\nArtists’ NFTs: The artists associated with Sony, for example, can release their premium merchandise via NFTs which draws in the premium segment from their customer base.\nEquipment tracking via NFTs: Expensive equipment can be tracked via NFTs to minimize theft and prevent duplicity from the original product. \nInformation leak prevention: To prevent information spillage from sensitive decisions, information can be marked with NFTs to make the parties liable in case of leakage. \nDigital collectibles as NFTs: Digital Artworks, comics, experiences, stories, performances in Facebook, Instagram can be converted into NFTs.\nBuilding connection through NFTs: A prime use case for offering NFTs on Facebook and especially Instagram is to give users a reason to open Meta’s Novi digital wallet.\nMetaverse using NFTs: Through NFTs, one can buy experiences, luxury, within the Metaverse. LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton is one of the first brands within the fashion industry to launch a metaverse game called “Lous” where players can collect NFTs. \nWay Forward: Analyzing the Current Legal Standpoint\n\nIt may be reiterated that NFTs are categorized as, among others, digital artwork, and therefore, the nature of their ownership can be understood through the Indian Copyright Act 1957 (Copyright Act). On purchasing an NFT, the copyright in the NFT does not automatically transfer to the purchaser. Such rights can be transferred during the sale of NFT if the contract specifically contains a provision to this effect. In that view, trading of NFTs under contract would also fall under the purview of the Indian Contract Act 1872 and the Information and Technology Act 2000.      \n\nFurthermore in this context, it has been argued by some that NFTs are either derivatives or contracts. However, while the independent contractual aspect of NFTs has been discussed earlier in this paper, it is quite uncertain whether NFTs can be regarded as a contract in derivatives under Section 2(ac) (B) of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act 1956 (SCR Act). Pursuant to Section 18A of the SCR Act, such contracts in derivatives must be traded on legally recognized stock exchange platforms to be considered legal and valid, which is not the case with the status of NFTs under the law. In any case, the latest development in the Finance Bill 2022 requires the taxation of the income earned from digital assets which include NFTs to be classified under the different categories of assets under the IT Act. \n\nThe subsequent part to this of this blog will aim to discuss the scope of NFT usage and the need for strengthening their regulation through the lens of their uses and possible implications therein in the real estate industry.\n\nNFTCryptocurrencyFinance BillReal Estate\nCorporate Law\n114 views\n1 like.

        "title": "Section 29a(H) of IBC: Eligibility of Resolution Applicants",
        "content": "Harshit Joshi\nAug 4, 2022\n6 min read\nSection 29a(H) of IBC: Eligibility of Resolution Applicants\n[Harshit is a student at Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies.]\n\nThe Supreme Court of India (SC) clarified the extent of a personal guarantor's ineligibility as a resolution applicant (RA) under Section 29A(h) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code), in its landmark decision in Bank of Baroda and Another v. MBL Infrastructures Limited (MBL Infrastructures) on 18 January 2022. The SC held that a creditor's claim of a guarantee will be applied in rem to all other creditors who are in a similar position.\n\nSection 29A of the Code lists the ineligibility requirements that prevent an RA from taking part in the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). A guarantor who has signed a guarantee in favour of a creditor is disqualified under Section 29A(h). In terms of its scope, the provision requires further clarification. This article will critically evaluate the ruling in MBL Infrastructures and the legal precedents surrounding Section 29A of the Code. The article will further explain how the verdict affects a guarantor's legal responsibility under the Code.\n\nFACTS \n\nInvoking the personal guarantor's assurance, RBL Bank (RBL) and a few other financial creditors issued a notice in accordance with Section 13(2) of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Act 2002. RBL then submitted a petition to initiate CIRP against MBL Infrastructures Limited in accordance with Section 7 of the Code. Two resolution plans were then delivered to the resolution professional, one of which was submitted by the personal guarantor before Section 29A was inserted into the Code. However, Section 29A of the Code was introduced before the committee of creditors (CoC) could decide on the resolution plan given by the personal guarantor. \n\nConsidering this development, the personal guarantor submitted a request to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) asking for an order stating its exemption from disqualification under subparagraphs (c) and (h) of Section 29A of the Code. In accordance with Section 29A(h) of the Code, the NCLT further ruled that an RA will not be disqualified for merely extending a personal guarantee if that guarantee has not yet been triggered. Additionally, it noted that even if some creditors have used the assurance provided by an RA, such disqualification will not be attracted.\n\nAs a result, the CoC decided to vote on the RA's resolution plan. However, the necessary votes were not cast in favour of the plan. Thereafter, the RA submitted a request for a directive to the dissident creditors to support the resolution plan under Section 60 of the Code. As a result, the CoC adopted the resolution plan. Another amendment to Section 29A(h) of the Code came into effect in 2018, looming RA's disqualification. The NCLT ruled that the matter pertaining to Section 29A(h) of the Code had been previously resolved. As a result, it gave the order for the CoC-approved resolution plan to take effect. The said order then went on to appeal before the SC. \n\nJURISPRUDENCE OF SECTION 29A \n\nThe committee reports and court decisions are essential for advancing our understanding of the Code, in view of its dynamic nature. When addressing Section 29A(h) of the Code in the Insolvency Law Committee Report in 2018 (IL Committee), it was questioned if the provision's intent was to disqualify a guarantor only in situations when the guarantee had been invoked or whether the disqualification applied on non-invocation, as well. \n\nTherefore, it was necessary to foresee and clarify the ambiguities that may arise on interpretation. It was noted that the clause could not be meant to disqualify a guarantor merely for issuing an \"enforceable\" guarantee. The IL Committee recommended that the word 'enforceable' ought to be removed from clause (h) and the phrase 'and such guarantee has been invoked by the creditor and remains unpaid in full or part by the guarantor' should be added to the said clause. The IL Committee correctly recognized that subsection (h) was discriminatory. Consequently, an amendment was passed in 2018 that carried out the above recommendations. \n\nThe courts have emphasized the importance of giving the Code a purposeful construction. The interpretation of the terms 'control' and 'management' was taken into consideration by the SC in ArcelorMittal India Private Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta in order to determine the scope of Section 29A. Accordingly, the court decided that Section 29A of the Code was included to prohibit a backdoor entry of individuals in power or management who initially pushed the corporate debtor toward insolvency. In Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel and Power Limited, it was determined that a person who was ineligible to be an RA under the Code was also disqualified from making a compromise under the terms of the Companies Act 2013. As a result, it was determined that Section 29A of the Code was essential in ensuring that the objectives of the Code were not compromised by allowing 'ineligible persons' to return in a new form of the RA, including but not limited to members of the company’s management.\n\nThe meaning and importance of sub-section (h) of Section 29A of the Code were specifically examined by the two-member NCLT bench in RBL Bank Limited v. MBL Infrastructures Limited. The NCLT held that only those guarantors with antecedents that may have jeopardized the validity of the procedures under the Code may be regarded as being excluded from Section 29A (h) of the Code. Therefore, the sub-section does not exclude all guarantors. In addition, the NCLT noted that the term 'enforceable' in the provision must be in conformity with the overall objectives of the Code. The meaning of the term must not be taken literally. Since guarantors were not given a chance to pay back the debt by utilizing their guarantee, the law could not be allowed to function in a vacuum and punish them. Further, in Punjab National Bank v. Concord Hospitality (Private) Limited, the NCLT stated that an RA would not lose his eligibility merely because he provided a guarantee in support of a corporate debtor when the guarantee is not exercised.\n\nSCOPE OF SECTION 29A(h)\n\nIn MBL Infrastructures, the SC used a purposive interpretation approach to assess the scope of Section 29A(h) of the Code. It was noted that the provision simply specifies that 'a creditor' must avail the guarantee. The insolvency procedure is regarded to be in rem, once initiated, as was stated in the case of Swiss Ribbon v. Union of India. As a consequence, all similarly placed creditors would have equal rights. The SC decided that in the present case, a similar approach would apply.\n\nThe SC also addressed the issue of whether the same creditor should file an application and invoke the guarantee extended by a personal guarantor. It was noted that there would be a bar to eligibility under Section 29A(h) of the Code even if the guarantee had been exercised by one creditor but the application had been lodged by another. \n\nThe SC also pointed out that 'similarly placed creditors' should be the correct interpretation of the word 'such creditor' as it appears in Section 29A(h) of the Code. Other creditors can now utilize their rights to safeguard their interests as a result. The SC took note of the same, keeping in mind that the judiciary's position must be in conformity with the Code's objectives.\n\nFurthermore, it was clarified that the RA's simple submission of the resolution plan does not: (a) provide them any new rights; or (b) revoke any existing rights. As a result, a resolution plan or RA may be subject to a bar on a later amendment until the date of the authority's adjudication or the CoC's approval. The SC decided that the resolution plan is, nevertheless, in the interest of the corporate debtor’s revival, and the resulting interests of employees and other stakeholders.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNumerous concerns involving the obligation of personal guarantors under the Code have been addressed by the courts in the recent past. Another important ruling on the above aspects by the SC was Lalit Kumar Jain v. Union of India. The SC's decision was concerned with the personal guarantor's liability to a corporate debtor. With the judgment now in force, the creditors can file for insolvency against individuals who act as personal guarantors for services rendered to the corporate debtors, such as promoters or managers. As a result of this ruling, the personal guarantors now have a stricter obligation under the Code.\n\nIn conclusion, by ruling that a guarantee invoked by one would be operative as against all, it may be argued that the SC in MBL Infrastructures took a tough stance against the personal guarantors of a corporate debtor. Therefore, the personal guarantors must exercise caution before providing the guarantee to a creditor because doing so might cause the debt due to all creditors to crystallize, infringing on the guarantee's conditions. However, this judgment is a welcome step toward strengthening the guarantors' legal obligations under the Code. In doing so, the SC prevented the stakeholders from hiding behind the technicality of the provisions and abusing the Code’s procedures, so as to defeat the Code’s core objectives.\nCodeMBLPersonal GuarantorInsolvency\nInsolvency Law\n736 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "‘SPACs’ – No More a Chimaera for the Indian Market",
        "content": "Hardik Baid\nJul 26, 2022\n6 min read\n‘SPACs’ – No More a Chimaera for the Indian Market\n[Hardik is a student at National Law University Delhi.]\n\nSpecial purpose acquisition company (SPAC) has become a hot topic in recent years in the Indian and international business landscape. A SPAC is a type of a ‘shell company’ or ‘blank cheque company’ that has no underlying business operations and is incorporated for the sole purpose of merging with or acquiring an attractive private company. The SPAC is floated on the stock exchange by a group of experts, also known as ‘sponsors’, having 15-20% shareholding in it. It raises capital through an initial public offering (IPO) to public investors for financing such merger or acquisition. After listing, the SPAC locates a target and completes the business combination within the stipulated period, failing which they may be required to return the funding to the concerned investors. A SPAC acquisition, therefore, allows the acquired company to benefit from such a listing without having to go through the formalities and rigors of an IPO.\n\nIn the past few years, India has become a fertile land of buoyant business ecosystems, with businesses and investors looking towards SPACs for raising capital in an inexpensive and less cumbersome way. However, India does not have a legislative framework enabling the listing of private companies via the SPAC route. Additionally, current laws and regulations present several complexities, strict upper limits, and tax consequences in cross-border SPAC deals as well. \n\nConsequently, Indian companies such as ReNew Power have started moving overseas and getting listed on foreign exchanges, causing a direct loss of business and revenue for India. This raises demand for the government to allow in-bound and out-bound SPACs in India. \n\nCatering to the same, the government and the market regulator, i.e., the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), have begun undertaking steps to create a SPAC-conducive environment in the Indian market. This article focuses on the recent developments centered around SPACs that shift the current regressive regulatory regime towards the possibility of formulating laws enabling SPACs in India.\n\nThe Current Regulatory Regime \n\nThe regulations pertaining to SPACs place several roadblocks in the way of domestic and cross-border SPAC deals. To begin with, since a SPAC does not have any business objective barring the acquisition of an unspecified private company at the time of incorporation, it cannot fulfil the criteria for registration under Sections 7(1) and 4(c) of the Companies Act 2013. The SPAC would also be subject to action under Section 248(1), which provides that a company’s name may be struck off if it has failed to commence its business within one year of its incorporation if the SPAC fails to acquire a target within that period. Furthermore, the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2018 prohibit the listing of ‘blank-cheque’ companies under Regulation 6, which prescribes eligibility requirements for a company desirous of making an IPO in terms of net tangible assets, average operating profits, and net worth. Cross-border SPAC transactions also have to comply with the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations 2018, which mandate RBI approval. Moreover, the current Liberalized Remittance Scheme disincentivises Indian shareholders from investing in the overseas SPAC by fixing an upper-limit value of USD 250,000 per financial year for acquired securities. \n\nNeedless to say, a SPAC cannot fulfil the requirements under the aforementioned provisions. To resolve the same, the Authorities have taken steps to introduce SPACs in India and develop the governing regulations.\n\nAnalyzing Recent Developments\n\nPrimary Market Advisory Committee by SEBI\n\nIn March 2021, SEBI formed a group of experts under the Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) to examine the feasibility of introducing SPACs, address its concerns, and look into the safeguards investors will need should SPACs be allowed. PMAC is currently in the process of finalising its report and issuing a consultation paper for public comments on the matter. \n\nIFSCA Listing Regulations\n\nOne of the most significant steps in introducing SPACs in India has been the publication of the consultation paper on issuing and listing securities by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) in 2021. The consultation paper provided for the IFSCA (Issuance and Listing of Securities) Regulations 2021 (IFSCA Regulations) which, inter-alia, contain explicit provisions for SPAC listings under Chapter VI. \n\nThe IFSCA Regulations prescribe eligibility criteria for a SPAC to raise capital, including that the target business combination shall not have been identified before the IPO and that the SPAC facilitates redemption and liquidation. It stipulates the initial disclosures in the offer document, offer size (less than USD 50 million), minimum application size (USD 250,000), minimum subscription (75% of the offer size), sponsors’ post-issue holding (15-20%) and a timeline of 36-months to effect the acquisition. The IFSCA Regulations also provide for SPAC-specific obligations until the consummation of the SPAC’s business combination. \n\nWith the regulations in place, the stage is all set to realize the Indian SPAC dream at the IFSC, to begin with. The IFSCA Regulations shall provide domestic and international sponsors opportunities to acquire unlisted companies in India and overseas. Further, these regulations are in line with international laws and provide benefits and safety measures for listing SPACs. Significantly, the IFSCA Regulations provide a skeletal framework for the central government and SEBI to serve as effective guidance for developing the national framework. \n\nReport of the Company Law Review Committee\n\nIn March 2022, the Company Law Review Committee (CLRC) published a report wherein it recommended the introduction of enabling provisions to recognise SPACs and to allow SPACs incorporated in India to be listed on domestic and global exchanges. Noting the desirability of listing Indian companies on overseas exchanges and carrying out business in such jurisdictions, the Committee thought it necessary to enable the listing on global exchanges as well.\n\nThe CLRC recommended the recognition of SPACs as legal entities under the Companies Act 2013 and exempted them from the ‘shell company’ provisions. It further recommended amending existing laws that inhibit SPACs, such as the requirement of conducting business to avoid being struck off. CLRC referred to Section 23(3) of the Companies Act 2013, which enables certain classes of public companies to issue securities to list on permitted stock exchanges in foreign jurisdictions, and Section 23(4), which allows the Central Government to exempt such public companies, inter-alia, from the provisions of Chapter III and IV. It opined that the commencement of these sections is a necessary pre-condition for the foreign listing of an Indian-incorporated SPAC. \n\nThe CLRC recommendations are hailed as a progressive step expected to give much-needed regulatory clarity and solve several regulatory and tax concerns for companies and investors, thus developing a conducive ecosystem for listing SPACs in India.\n\nSuggestions and Conclusion\n\nThe recent development envisaging the incorporation of SPACs in the Indian market reflects the positive outlook of the regulators to quickly adapt to the changing business requirements and welcome new investment routes such as SPAC. \n\nThe foremost thing to do to enable SPACs in India is to adopt a definition of ‘shell companies’ in a way to exclude SPACs, following the recommendation of CLRC. Inspiration can be taken from the definition of ‘shell companies’ under ¶1160.2 of SEC’s Financial Reporting Manual, which excludes a company having an asset-backed issuer from the ambit of a shell company.\n\nIt is also crucial to address the concerns about SPACs while formulating a framework regulating them. The sheer nature and structure of a SPAC raises some concerns—from dubious business practices to questionable disclosures and misalignment of interest between people selling SPACs and the people buying them. Hence, the national framework should provide minimum sponsor contribution and post-issue lock-in in the merged entity to ensure the sponsors’ skin in the game. Further, to ensure transparency and investor protection, it should provide for minimum thresholds of IPO subscription, sponsors’ shareholding, and lay down disclosure norms and accounting standards to be followed by the sponsors and the target company. It should also provide exit options to the dissenting shareholders who disagree with the proposed merger. \n\nIndia can take inspiration from other jurisdictions that already have SPAC-centred regulations, especially the USA and Singapore. In the USA, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed ‘revised rules’ for enhancing transparency and investor protections by increasing the potential liability for SPACs, underwriters, and target companies and specialised disclosure obligations for SPACs. Singapore Exchange Ltd. has introduced a listing framework (SGX Rulebook) governing SPACs that strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of the sponsors and shareholders. Pertinently, it has introduced additional requirements (Rule 625) which mandate disclosures by SPACs, including the issuer’s structure and inherent risk factors, business strategy, acquisition conditions and potential conflicts of interest. These regulations can serve as a guide for SEBI and the Indian government in preparing a framework for SPACs. \n\nIn the string of recent developments and ever-increasing demand from the industry, it is evident that SPACs will no longer remain chimaera in Indian markets. While introducing SPACs would facilitate and promote greater ease of doing business in India, a cautious approach must be adopted to ensure appropriate dealing with the concerns and issues over SPACs. The best time for introducing SPACs in India can be best decided by the government and SEBI. \nCapital MarketsSecurities RegulationMergersAcquisitionsSPAC\nCorporate Law\n478 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Is SEBI a Capricious Regulator? A Review of the Ruchi Soya FPO and the LIC IPO",
        "content": "Praveen Sharma, Sakshi Nalawade\nJul 24, 2022\n5 min read\nIs SEBI a Capricious Regulator? A Review of the Ruchi Soya FPO and the LIC IPO\n[Praveen and Sakshi are students at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the regulatory body entrusted with promoting the Indian securities market and the protection of investor interests. In pursuance of these objectives, the SEBI must appropriately consider other related matters concerning the Indian securities market, along with the interests of non-investor participants. The power bestowed upon SEBI must be exercised with great care and caution to maintain market stability. \n\nThis post highlights two recent instances wherein the SEBI acted in an 'unprecedented' and 'uncertain' manner, raising questions concerning its procedural accountability. These actions further implied  a compromise of rationale and transparency while exercising its ‘discretionary powers’ – thus possibly costing the faith instituted in it as a regulator.\n The Ruchi Soya FPO Case\n\nRuchi Soya, a listed entity, and Patanjali Ayurved’s subsidiary came out with a Follow on Public Offer (Ruchi Soya FPO) to comply with the SEBI's regulation of minimum public shareholding of 25% for a listed entity as prescribed in Rule 19(2)(b) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957. On 28 March after the trading hours, SEBI decided to allow all the investors except the anchor book participants who participated in the FPO to withdraw their bids. This was based on an unscrupulous SMS sent to prospective investors urging them to invest in the FPO. SEBI stated the contents were \"misleading/fraudulent\" and not in compliance with the SEBI Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (ICDR Regulations). Accordingly, Patanjali’s bankers were directed to inform the investors of the withdrawal option and circulated unsolicited SMSs in view of this development. The withdrawal window was kept open for three days. Consequently, nearly 97 lakh bids were withdrawn.\n\nSEBI would have been justified in opening a withdrawal window for three consecutive days only if it had some evidence associating the promoters with the unscrupulous messages. Although ‘protection of investors’ is one of the primary objectives of SEBI, being a regulated entity itself, it cannot act on mere suspicion. The direction implied the existence of actual fraud and manipulation in the FPO. It cast doubts in the minds of the investors, resulting in a massive withdrawal of bids. A similar move could be made to disrupt any IPO or FPO in the future. \n\nFurther, as per Regulation 179(1) of the ICDR Regulations, qualified institutional buyers are not allowed to withdraw their bids after the closure of the issue. This is to prevent any possible  manipulation; however, there was non-compliance with this requirement under the SEBI framework.\n\nMoreover, the stock exchanges were not fully equipped to smoothly carry out the withdrawal action. The FPO disclosure webpage was shut down by both the exchanges as simultaneous updates of the withdrawals could not be calculated. Thereby, the investors were kept uninformed throughout the process. Accordingly, as per the principles of natural justice, the transparency of the process was compromised. Putting together the basis of the direction, its execution, and its future implications - it may be concluded that this was not a calculated move. \n The LIC IPO Case\n\nState-owned LIC’s initial public offering (LIC IPO) was the biggest-ever public listing and was dubbed India’s Aramco moment. The interesting points in the LIC IPO were the instances wherein SEBI chose to bend its rules to streamline the initial public offer (IPO) process for LIC. Before February 2021, it was standard procedure for companies to divest at least 10% of their stock in a public offering. The Indian government went ahead to amend the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Rules 1957 (SCRR), through a notification on 19 June 2021, to change the divestment rules. After this amendment, companies with a market valuation of more than INR 1 lakh crore at the time of listing, were allowed to hold up to 5% of their shares. The government anticipated the market would not be able to absorb the entire offer, thus this adjustment was designed with LIC in mind.\n\nFurther, after 30 days from the date of allotment, anchor investors were allowed to sell only 50% of the shares allotted under the ICDR Rules . However, in the case of LIC, according to news reports, after 30 days from the date of assignment, LIC anchor investors were permitted to sell 100% of their allotted shares.\n\nWhat becomes a point of concern here is not only the exemptions provided but the loss borne by the participating investors. Almost $17 billion has been wiped out since the LIC listing and in fact, it has been termed Asia’s biggest wealth destroyer. With the exemptions provided, already setting a ‘wrong precedent’, the huge losses suffered by the investors creates greater responsibilities for the SEBI, in view of the expedited and streamlined the IPO process.\n\nThese exemptions granted to LIC imply that in the future, if a company requests an exemption from specific ICDR Regulations, it can rely on the exemptions granted to LIC. In essence, following natural justice principles, every company seeking to list should now be permitted to set aside a quota of IPOs for their consumers. When there is a national or global crisis that impacts the market, relaxation of the lock-in term for anchor investors may be sought based on the same considerations.\n\nSEBI’s Execution of Discretionary Powers: An Analysis\n\nIt may be argued that SEBI’s actions are ‘discretionary’ coming under the ambit of Sections 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act 1992 (SEBI Act). The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has often directed the SEBI on the bits of power and discretion under these provisions. For instance, in Videocon International v. SEBI, the SAT observed that the power under these sections is remedial and not punitive. Further in Manu Finlease Limited v. SEBI, the SAT defined “remedial action” as an action to correct, remove or lessen a wrong and not to impose a penalty. Notably,  Pancard Clubs Limited v. SEBI, the SAT  stated that the discretion bestowed upon SEBI under Section 11(1), 11(4), and 11B of the SEBI Act, could not be exercised in a disorderly manner.\n\nDuring a time when the SEBI has been planning to introduce tougher pricing norms for startup IPOs, giving leeway to a state-owned company such as LIC may send out the wrong message. With India breaking into the world's top five clubs in terms of stock market capitalization, SEBI’s onus increases before taking any major regulatory steps. Such unprecedented and hasty actions may hamper the SEBI’s public perception. The exemptions and adjustments made for, what may be, LIC’s convenience may have long-term implications for the Indian capital market.\n\nThus, while taking any (remedial) discretionary action, the SEBI should ensure that it has a strong rationale and is guided by sound principles of natural justice and fair play in action. In the Ruchi Soya FPO and the LIC IPO, there is no doubt that the SEBI was statutorily empowered to exercise ‘discretion’ for its actions. However, the-after-effects of such actions could be that in the future, market participants could contest similar treatment from the regulator on the grounds of natural justice. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn view of the above arguments, SEBI may need to consider its overall objectives and regulatory actions in the Indian securities market. In the future, SEBI will have to take immediate discretionary actions to maintain market stability and protect all its participants. Therefore, there should be an established procedure with fixed parameters – and  adherence to this procedure should be mandatory. This procedure could include, for instance, iterating the criteria guiding the decision and intended objectives for such decisions. This would ensure compliance with the principles of natural justice and transparency.\nSEBIRuchi SoyaICDR\nCorporate Law\n198 views\n3 likes. Post not marked as liked\n3"

        "title": "Ban on Loading PPIs from Credit Lines: A Bewildered Space",
        "content": "Jeezan Riyaz, Aakash Arun Rao\nJul 23, 2022\n6 min read\nBan on Loading PPIs from Credit Lines: A Bewildered Space\n[Jeezan and Aakash are students at National Law Institute University, Bhopal.]\n\nSelling goods and services on credit is an age-old idea. For the most part, it appears to be a win-win situation for the buyer and the seller. Since buyers need not worry about the necessary resources needed within a stipulated timeframe, on the other hand, the sellers are most happy when they are able to clear out their stock much quicker. In recent years, several fintech companies in India have developed products to cater to this segment of the market. However, an RBI short circular address issued on 20 June 2022 (not uploaded to the RBI website) seems to restrict or strictly regulate, by reiterating its bank vs non-bank position, the credit flows.\n\nIn India, several fintech firms in this segment have structured their products using the pre-paid instruments (PPIs) to their benefit. Some of these popular products are often dubbed as ‘buy now, pay later’ options available across a variety of e-commerce portals wherein the instrument itself is issued by a partner who holds a PPI licence and it is loaded by the credit from another partner typically a bank or a non-banking financial company (NBFC). For instance, let us take the example of cards issued by X. It has partnered with Y (Bank), which holds a valid PPI license, for the purpose of issuing cards. Now, X uses its quadrillion finance strategy by asking the partnered NBFC to load credit in the card instead of approaching the formal credit structures, i.e., the financial institutions. This structure involves several players contributing to making available credit products that cater to the simple needs of a customer. \n\nHowever, what the RBI’s recent diktat essentially does is to rule out NBFCs from extending credit by narrowly interpreting the provisions contained in the master directions on PPIs to hold that such loading cannot be permitted since only cash, debit or credit cards, PPIs (as permitted) and other payment instruments issued by regulated entities in India is allowed.  In simple words, the RBI has sought to disrupt the existing structures as aforementioned to clearly demarcate between the bank credit and non-bank credit over PPIs. The post intends to analyze the RBI’s master direction on PPIs while scrutinizing the validity of the fintech spaces and the ever-expanding partnership model between NBFCs and fintech companies. \n\nBank v/s Non-Bank Credit\n\nBack in the day, availing of credit was strenuous as it was out of the reach of the poorer section of the society and the student community in general; therefore, in order to bridge this aperture, NBFCs were established. The bequest of NBFCs in supporting the economic activities has been colossal and their role as a derivative channel of credit arbitrament alongside banks is well acknowledged. This is because if an individual possesses a card, and cannot load money into their wallet, the same shall be taken care off by the NBFCs, giving a hassle free facility of availing of credit. Herein, the facility in terms of credit, provided by the NBFCs would not come from a bank but from a revolving line of credit, which has been disapproved by the RBI.\n\nThe logic behind the RBI’s emphasis on the separation of bank and non-bank credit can be traced to the fact that bank credit usually is availed after taking into account factors such as collateral or a person’s credit history or worthiness to pay back the secured amount. In contrast, the non-bank credit line is a predetermined borrowing limit. Such credit lines allow for flexibility as one can access credit at any time, as per need and give the borrower a levy to tap a straight line of credit for its intended use. \n\nNBFCs also provide for regulatory support as loading of money through a revolving line of credit was recognized by the RBI in Prudential Framework for the Resolution of Stressed Assets and accordingly is permitted to issue all categories of prepaid payment instruments, provided it meets the requisites laid down by the RBI. But now, the RBI is keen on regulating PPIs with security over flexibility in mind. Therefore, if a customer is not in a position to repay the amount, the onus is on the NBFC and not the partnered bank to ensure that the debts are not accumulated in the economy. \n\nEffect on Products such as BNPL\n\nWith credit percolating and the fintech companies permeating liquidity into the market, RBI has become skeptical of such an orchestration, and accordingly discredited the ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) model. The circular does not restrict funding PPIs through credit cards but credit lines, as many fintech companies offering BNPL products are funded through receipts, availed from a revolving line of credit, specifically an NBFC, even though it is beyond comprehension as far as now, whether or not the intention of the RBI is to allow funding PPIs through credit lines, approved and authorized by banks.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of the emergence of BNPL companies in the fora which usually partner with traditional banks (some market examples include SBM, RBL and IDFC) to issue PPIs (including physical cards) and further partner with NBFCs to load amounts in the wallet over a credit line.  As a consequence, now the BNPL companies find themselves in a pickle since they would have to reimagine the existing structures with credit only flowing from the banks and without the involvement of NBFCs in such an equation.\n\nThe banks will have to step up their role in this partnership for the sake of the survival of such structured BNPL companies. However, as mentioned earlier, several factors such as security or a person’s creditworthiness determine the scope of availing of formal bank credit. Therefore, BNPL companies that typically aim to facilitate very short-term minor amounts of credit might not be in a position to fully address their existing market requirements with formal bank credit into the equation. \n\nSocial Impact of This Move\n\nThe RBI does not allow setting up neo-banks or fully digital banks without the appropriate blend of physical and digital infrastructure. The opposition comes from negating the human touch from the design. Therefore, neo-banks can operate only by the way of an outsourcing arrangement. In such a structure, they only provide an interface and undertake initial steps, which is ultimately backed by the credit from the banks and non-banks under supervision and control the reserve bank.\n\nInterestingly, RBI seems that there is a strong backing for this sort of banking arrangement. Quoting the present RBI Governor Mr Shaktikanta Das, “the existing architecture is sufficient to enable existing players to leverage the innovations.” He went on to comment that BNPL companies should be approached carefully without causing interference. Incongruously, this view is in stark contrast to what the reserve bank has done in the instant case. \n\nNot only has the RBI put restrictions on the concerned fintech companies from leveraging the existing infrastructures to its benefit for building scale, but it has also restricted the flow of credit to such ‘uncreditworthy’ sections of the society. Such sections that are largely kept out of the formal credit system earlier found access to minor credit for purchases. It is anticipated that in India, the BNPL industry would flourish as the number of users could rise to 80-100 million by 2026, as compared to 10-15 million customers currently. However, the issuance of bank credit instruments such as credit cards has not kept up with the credit appetite. \n\nTherefore, this move has not only dented an industry quickly working to create innovative products to cater to this market, which is predicted to grow up to 7% of the total retail GMV by end of FY 2026 but also affected the poorer section of the society, who will have to go back to the hassles of the formal credit lending structures as RBI wanted the economy to do away with “no credit loaded cards through a revolving line”.\n\nConclusion with Remarks\n\nThe fintech space in India has a steep potential to bank the unbanked but the sharp pull from the RBI has disrupted the entire status quo of these spaces as loading of wallets through credit lines. The main drawback of the findings of the RBI is premised on the growing partnership between fintech companies and NBFCs.\n\nIn a similar vein, RBI is telling the ecosystem that innovation can only be brought about by the banks and not non-banking financial institutions, which is a serious concern amidst the ever-expanding fintech space. Therefore, in light of the same, RBI curbs innovation as a lot of the private equity and venture capital monies have come into the fintech space in the last few years. Even the delinquent ratio (used to characterize a financial institution’s lending portfolio) in terms of ticket lending of these NBFCs or PPIs is preposterously low as compared to the big corporate loans. If such an overly precautionary approach continues in India, then she will eventually be losing out on fintech advancements and will lag behind the techno-powerful markets of China, America and the European Union.\nRBIPPIBNPLFintech\nCorporate Law\n•\nCommercial Law\n108 views\n1 like.

        "title": "The Issue of Exclusive Agreements: Analysing the Bookmyshow Case",
        "content": "Aditi Dehal, Aayush Mishra\nJul 23, 2022\n6 min read\nThe Issue of Exclusive Agreements: Analysing the Bookmyshow Case\n[Aditi and Aayush are students at Himachal Pradesh National Law University, Shimla.]\n\nBookMyShow is often the first application that comes to our mind whenever we are booking a movie ticket. It is operated by Big Tree Entertainment Private Limited and is an intermediary that enables the online buying of tickets for movies, plays, concerts, and sports events in India. On 16 June 2022, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) directed the Director General to investigate BookMyShow in the matter of Re: Vijay Gopal v. Big Tree Entertainment Private Limited [Case Number 46 of 2021]. In this lawsuit, BookMyShow is accused of abusing its supposed dominating position in the market and eliminating competitors on many occasions. In particular, CCI considered the Kalagato report, wherein BookMyShow’s share in online booking of movie tickets during January 2017 to March 2017, in terms of booking volume, was 78%. The same year, in January, BookMyShow acquired Hyderabad based online ticketing platform MastiTickets. In February, it acquired a majority stake in Pune based DIY events ticketing and registration platform Townscript. According to one of the charges, BookMyShow has engaged in exclusive arrangements with specific cinemas and theatres, preventing other online ticketing brokers from entering the Indian market and thereby, hindering the competition. This article mainly focuses on the topic of exclusive agreements and its intermittent conflict with India’s antitrust regime.\n\nARE ALL EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS ANTI-COMPETITIVE?\n\nExclusive agreements are a type of vertical agreements in which one party commits to sell all or a significant portion of its output of a service or product to a certain customer. Section 3(4) of the Competition Act 2002 (Act) explicitly specifies that exclusive supply agreements, exclusive distribution agreements, or a failure to deal agreement would be considered anti-competitive if they are likely to have a significant adverse effect on competition (AAEC) in India. However, the Act does not define the word AAEC. Instead, it relies heavily on the CCI's established precedents and reasoning. CCI must examine a non-exhaustive set of considerations outlined in Section 19(3) of the Act for deciding whether an agreement results in AAEC or not. This includes an assessment of parameters such as hurdles to entry, driving current rivals out of the market, advantages to customers, elimination of competition, improvement in distribution of goods/services, and promotion of scientific, technological, or economic progress. There is no established criteria or reasons for evaluating the AAEC caused by exclusive agreements or for deciding which element should be accorded greater weightage than the others. Accordingly, such determination takes place on a case-to-case basis. The CCI also noted that in the event of any modifications, fresh approval ought to be sought.\n\nAll exclusive agreements are not unlawful or anti-competitive per se. If the agreement reflects the potential to significantly harm the competition in India, only then is it regarded as anti-competitive behaviour. Section 3(4) is frequently interpreted in accordance with Section 4 of the Act, which prohibits enterprises from abusing their dominating position. While dominant position is primarily determined by a party's market share (if it exceeds 50%), CCI has repeatedly weighed in, among other factors, the market structure, entry hurdles, and longevity of the agreement for the purposes of evaluating an agreement under Section 3(4) of the Act.\n\nIn the case of BookMyShow, it would be difficult for the company to simply ignore the anti-competitive nature of the agreements if the restrictions in the exclusive agreement with theatres have created an entry barrier in the market. The CCI has observed that BookMyShow holds a large market share i.e., at least 90% as compared to its competitors in the market for “online intermediation services for booking movie tickets in India”. However, it is also essential to realise that BookMyShow states that their exclusive partnership with theatres benefits them, as these theatres lack the ability to set up online ticket buying systems, hence enhancing distribution. It asserts that the agreement has a greater number of pro-competitive advantages than anti-competitive disadvantages.\n\nHOW DOES AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT BECOME PRO-COMPETITIVE?\n\nTo ensure fair competition in the market, there must be a balance between the anti-competitive and pro-competitive impacts of an exclusive arrangement. A party can justify an exclusive agreement on the grounds that it seeks to resolve the free-rider problem and leads to an increase in the sales or distribution efficiency, which ultimately benefits the end-user. In a paper written by a member of the Chief Economist Team of the European Commission, the author used economic analysis to demonstrate that the pro-competitive effects of an exclusive dealing are highest when the firms are symmetric and on the other hand, are nearly non-existent when one party has greater market power than the other. For instance, if Paytm, a competitor of BookMyShow, is entirely symmetric to it; or in simpler terms, if customers prefer both Paytm and BookMyShow equally; or if theatres are indifferent in dealing exclusively with either of the two companies as long as they charge the same price, then the pro-competitive effect of the exclusive dealing will be evident. However, if BookMyShow has a greater market dominance or negotiation leverage in the same scenario, the benefits may not exist at all. \n\nGenerally, the party imposing the limitation in an exclusive agreement argues that the agreement provides efficiency advantages to end-consumers, does not destroy effective or efficient competition in the market, and that exclusivity is a necessary condition for pro-competitive market efficiency. These grounds are also included in the updated and comprehensive Recommendations on Vertical Restraints of the European Commission. Nevertheless, there is no precedent in India for relying on these recommendations in their entirety. India has not yet adopted a similar regulation.\n\nAnother criterion is the ‘no economic sense’ test, which argues that a party's behaviour should not be considered anti-competitive until and unless it is making no economic sense, i.e., not leading to monetary profit for the party and eliminating or restricting competition. If BookMyShow successfully provides economic arguments for entering into an exclusive deal in the market, then its actions may become acceptable. However, in its response to allegations, BookMyShow has claimed that it holds not more than 20% of the market share. Yet, what becomes questionable is its inability to support its claims. As per the CCI, BookMyShow has only revealed the total number of tickets sold, but not the actual value of tickets, thereby rendering the data inconsistent for the computation of market share.\n\nThe consumer welfare balancing test is another test which seeks to evaluate the merits and demerits of the action in relation to customer welfare. This test is rarely addressed since the party imposing restraints may readily identify consumer benefits resulting from the exclusive dealing; therefore, it cannot be the only determining element.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nIn order to explain how competition rules are to be construed, it is reasonable to argue that competition agencies and commissions must provide clear reasoning in their rulings. Even if there are several standards, as noted previously, to evaluate improper behaviour in terms of exclusive agreements, Courts often rely on established precedents and avoid deviating from them. In nations such as the United States and Ireland, in cases where no action is taken, the judgments are accompanied with an explanation for the same. Such a strategy, if adopted in India as well, can lead to the refinement of the legislation on the issue and assist CCI in making decisions that are more reasoned and evaluated, thus eliminating any ambiguity regarding the event when an exclusive agreement ceases to be pro-competitive. The analysis presented in no-action instances can assist individuals to comprehend that what may look anti-competitive at the first glance is actually a competition on the basis of merit. If considered by the CCI in its judgements, the European Commission's Guidelines on Vertical Restraints can help streamline decisions regarding Section 3(4) of the Act or decisions regarding exclusive agreements.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that antitrust laws scrutinise exclusive agreements more frequently than other types of agreements. There is a narrow line between the anti-competitiveness and pro-competitiveness of these agreements, which is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The party imposing the constraint tries its best to stress upon the pro-competitive efficiency and conceal the anti-competitive aspects of the agreement, but it is the responsibility of the CCI to evaluate the situation objectively in order to maintain fair competition in the market.\n\nSince the BookMyShow lawsuit is ongoing, it would be too early to evaluate the nature of the agreement entered into by BookMyShow with cinemas and theatres. Once the report of the Director General is submitted, the matter will become clearer. The ruling in this case can serve as a significant precedent for parties seeking to engage into similar exclusive agreements in a narrow market.\nCompetitionCompetition ActBookMyShow\nCompetition Law\n701 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Analysis of CCI’S Order Against BookMyShow and The Increasing Accountability of Intermediaries",
        "content": "Nardeep Mahesh Chawla\nJul 21, 2022\n5 min read\nAnalysis of CCI’S Order Against BookMyShow and The Increasing Accountability of Intermediaries\n[Nardeep is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai.]\n\nOn 16 June 2022, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) directed an investigation against Big Tree Entertainment Private Limited (BookMyShow) for allegedly abusing its dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act). The contentions raised by a social worker who is also a founder of an online ticket booking platform called “Showtyme” was that BookMyShow abused its dominant market position by entering into exclusive agreements with cinemas and multiplexes and used cash deposits and loans as leverage to create an impenetrable market.\n\nBookMyShow in its reply submitted that they are merely an intermediary platform facilitating movie ticket bookings – and  that there was no separate “market” for online bookings as the market is too wide to comprise physical bookings at the cinemas as well as other players such as PayTM, justticket.com, ticket4u.com and websites of cinema multiplexes like PVR, INOX, CINEPOLIS, etc. BookMyShow also contended that it was not “dominant” as it had a market share of only 20% in the last 5 years. Lastly, BookMyShow argued that it does not provide any monetary support in return for exclusivity - rather it only provides security deposits to adjust the ticket price and revenue share to the cinema theatres.\n\nCCI’S CONSISTENCY IN OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe CCI was not so convinced by the ticket booking platform’s arguments and decided against its contentions, one by one countering them in a reasoned and consistent manner. Firstly, the CCIobserved that there exists a separate market for online bookings of movie tickets in which BookMyShow, is the most well-known and used platform. Further, the CCI iterated that online websites of multiplexes, single-screen theatres, or even the box office cannot provide the same services for the booking of movie tickets as BookMyShow. Using the internet intermediation services of the intermediary platforms, a customer can search for and compare a variety of theatres and movies, as well as the ticket pricing, other offerings, and the seats available for a given show. Therefore, the CCI decided to define the relevant product market as the “market for online intermediation services for booking of movie tickets”. \n\nSecondly, the CCI on determinisation of dominance, looked at information that was already in the public domain rather than the data provided by BookMyShow. The CCI took into account the Kalagato Report, which stated that PayTM had a market share of 13 percent and BookMyShow had a market share of 78 percent as per online movie ticket booking volume in the period from January to March 2017. Additionally, the CCI took into account a media report from December 2018 that stated BookMyShow had a market share of between 70 and 75 percent for movie tickets. \n\nThirdly, the CCI noted that BookMyShow's ability to sign exclusive contracts within India demonstrates the position of strength it enjoys, and the various clauses in its agreements with movie theatres and multiplexes demonstrate its superior negotiating power when determining contractual terms. The CCI showed exceptional commitment to pursue big tech and big players after choosing to rely upon independent research studies about the market share rather relying solely on BookMyShow’s contentions. The CCI also drew a clear-cut distinction between the broader intermediatory market and the narrower ticket booking market. The CCI drew attention to the fact that BookMyShow had not provided information on its market share for its online intermediary services for purchasing movie tickets in India. Instead, BookMyShow had provided information on the number of tickets sold, which indicated total yearly footfalls rather than the money value of tickets. Such records were reportedly untenable and inconsistent for computing BookMyShow's market share even in the broader intermediary market, per its own contentions. \n\nEXCLUSIVITY IS THE PRICE \n\nOn the questions of abuse of dominance, the CCI took into account the various agreements signed between BookMyShow and the single screen theatres and noted that the exclusive agreements with single screen cinema theatres do not permit these cinemas to engage anybody directly or indirectly for services that are similar to those of BookMyShow or for facilitating the booking/sale of tickets through any online medium. This is because they may force competing intermediary platforms or new entrants to incur sizable additional costs to persuade theatres to renounce their exclusive contracts with the dominant platform with market power. Therefore, such exclusive agreements carry  potential to close or reduce competition in the relevant market. \n\nThe CCI also noted that the security deposits were used to create an exclusive market thereby restricting other market players. A similar decision was taken in the CCI’s enquiry against MakeMyTrip back in 9 March 2021, wherein the CCI had passed interim reliefs for Treebo and Fabhotels as MakeMyTrip had delisted the properties by Treebo and Fabhotels from their platform after they had signed an agreement with OYO Hotels (OYO). It may be noted that these hotel chains were seen as competitors to OYO. The CCI had noted that the continuation of exclusionary contractual terms between MakeMyTrip and OYO may change the competition landscape and tip the markets in favour of the two companies.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn view of the above, while the BookMyShow case prima facie appears to be a case of abuse of dominant position in the market, the final enquiry can reveal greater facts about the circumstances in which these exclusive contracts were signed and whether imbalanced bargaining powers were used by BookMyShow to garner more competitive advantage. Furthermore, it is pertinent to note that the competition watchdog is not hesitant to go after big names, and that too - on the application of a common man. The CCI acted with resilience on asking BookMyShow to submit its reply to the allegations. Further to what seems to be a careful perusal, the CCI passed an order of enquiry under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act (CCI Order). The CCI in its ending remarks also noted that although there is a clause for exchanging data in the contracts BookMyShow has with multiplexes, BookMyShow has reserved the right to data collection, ownership, and storage without the cinemas having any right, title, or interest in such data. The  exclusive possession of, and access to data by a dominant intermediary demands scrutiny since it has the potential to significantly bolster the platform's negotiating leverage over time. This shows that there is now growing responsibility upon intermediary platforms to act in a fair manner and not abuse their middleman status bereft of any business responsibilities. It is relevant to note, that the earlier case of MakeMyTrip had indicated that intermediaries are often inclined to engage in unfair market practises through exclusive dealings for greater market share. Arguably, the CCI Order in the present case is a positive step towards better antitrust regulation, particularly in an age where market participants rely increasingly on technology as a tool of business dominance. \nCompetitionCompetition ActCCIAbuse of DominanceBookMyShow\nCompetition Law\n703 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Need for Specialised Resolution Laws for Financial Institutions in India",
        "content": "Chhavi Singh\nJul 12, 2022\n6 min read\nNeed for Specialised Resolution Laws for Financial Institutions in India\n[Chhavi is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nResolution is the process of restructuring banks while safeguarding public interest, depositors’ interests, and continuing critical banking functions. In the Indian context, the resolution of banks and insolvency proceedings are governed by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) which also governs corporate insolvency in India. Most jurisdictions, be it developing countries or developed ones, have a separate law for resolving banks. \n\nHow are Financial Institutions Different from Non-Financial Corporates?\n\nBanks and other non-banking financial institutions (NBFC(s)) are very different from non-financial companies. Banks and NBFCs play a very critical role in a country’s economy. They are direct sources of liquidity and credit creation for any economy. They are interconnected within themselves and the economy.  Considering the main functions performed by banks, if there are concerns regarding a bank’s financial viability, the “value of the bank franchise dissipates very rapidly.”[1] “The bankruptcy costs of a bank failure are considerably higher than the bankruptcy costs of a non-financial firm” (emphasis supplied).[2] The negative externalities of bank failure become far more serious due to the interrelatedness of banks and financial institutions with the entire economy leading to a contagion effect / domino effect[3] and the spread of the failure or crisis in other regions and other financial companies, respectively. \n\nWhy is There a Need for a Separate Law?\n\nStandard insolvency and bankruptcy laws, like the IBC in the Indian context, are not best suited for resolution of banks and other financial institutions (FIs) as they are situated very differently from non-financial companies/institutions. Initially, it was envisaged that the resolution of FIs would happen under a separate law and the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill 2017 (FRDI Bill) was passed by the Parliament which was later withdrawn due to concern over the bail-in clause and deposit insurance cover. \n\nThe main objective of bank insolvency is ensuring the stability of the financial sector as opposed to general insolvency and bankruptcy rules like the IBC which aims to resolve claims of creditors and maximize returns for them. Under standard insolvency laws like the IBC, the focus is generally on protecting the creditors and the shareholders, with no mention of depositors in the order in which claims of different stakeholders are paid off. However, protecting depositors’ interests and preserving financial stability is the goal of all bank resolution laws in the world. The IBC was never meant to be applied to FIs and banks, but it can still be used for the resolution of banks or FIs under Section 227 of the IBC on directions from the Central Government or on the authorization of the RBI by the Central Government to invoke IBC for bank resolution under Section 35AA of the Banking Regulation Act 1949. In November 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs passed a new set of rules to expand the scope of the IBC to include financial service providers within its ambit. \n\nCorporate insolvency procedures are largely centered around negotiations involving creditor committees whereas the onus to give due regard to creditors and shareholders’ rights is on the bank regulator or supervisor on whose direction the resolution process is initiated. The rationale is that the object of corporate insolvency is to maximize returns for the creditors whereas the objective of bank insolvency is to prevent systemic problems and ensure stability of the economy while continuing critical banking functions and cushioning the damage to the banking system. Under the IBC, the insolvency process called the corporate insolvency resolution process kicks in only upon the occurrence of a default by the debtor. In the case of banks and other FIs, pre-emptive measures for preventing at-risk banks from going bankrupt are also very important given the large-scale systemic risks associated with such financial distress. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules 2019 (Insolvency & Bankruptcy FSP Rules) provide for the institution of CIRP against financial service providers (FSP) only on the occurrence of default by such an FSP under Section 4.\n\nResolution of banks requires different tools which general corporate insolvency laws do not envisage. According to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “national authorities should have appropriate tools to deal with all types of financial institutions”. The failing bank assets with rapidly decreasing value need to be resolved timely. The Financial Stability Board issued some key attributes for effective resolution of financial institutions which state that laws for effective resolution should provide for resolution tools such as transferring ownership of assets, and liabilities, critical functions to bridge banks, sale of non-performing assets, converting unsecured debts or liabilities to equity. The IBC is not equipped to use such resolution tools, whereas special insolvency laws for financial institutions in the US and the UK are. Transfer of assets, for instance, can be done much more rapidly if standard bankruptcy procedures are not followed and speed is key, to cushion the impact on the economy. Typically, the RBI has only two tools at its disposal- winding up or compulsory amalgamation/merger of a financially weak bank with a more stable bank. Resolution of FIs should be carried out by administrative resolution authorities in the interest of speed and efficacy. The Reserve Bank of India is significantly involved in resolutions of FIs and banks despite not being equipped to carry out such procedures. \n\nThe Government of India recognizes the need for a more efficient regime for the resolution of banks and protection of the interests of the depositors, which led to the introduction of the FRDI Bill in 2017. However, it had to be later withdrawn in 2018 due to opposition from depositors and stakeholders to the bail-in provision which allows either for writing down/canceling the liabilities of the institution, or conversion of debt into equity. Creditors were dissatisfied despite the fact that Section 55 states that creditors shall end up “redeeming more value of their claims than what they would be entitled to in case of a waterfall provision upon liquidation of the bank.” \n\nAnother concern is that the prudential regulator for financial institutions, the Reserve Bank of India in the Indian Context, should not be responsible for the resolution proceedings of financial institutions. If the supervising body is also made responsible for conducting the resolution process for FIs, any failure of an FI will reflect poorly on the supervisory function performed and it will be in the supervisor’s interest to delay the initiation of insolvency and resolution proceedings against FIs. A separate body is needed which has the appropriate resolution tools as well. An RBI Working Group itself has recommended that a single authority for the resolution of financial institutions is needed and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation should be given powers to act as receivers and liquidators of failed banks. The Ministry of Finance also recommended in 2016 that an independent body called the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Corporation should be set up for performing resolution functions for financial institutions. \n\nContinuity of banking functions and access to the market is critical for the stability of the economy overall. Corporate insolvency processes impose a blanket moratorium on enforcing claims, which would make continuity of critical functions very difficult. While a moratorium is important to ensure that resolution authorities can consider available options without facing pressure from creditors trying to enforce their claims. However, blocking all payments and claims will not be appropriate “given the needs of bank customers and households.” The Insolvency & Bankruptcy FSP Rules provide for an interim moratorium from the date the application for resolution is filed. While the said moratorium does not extend to “third-party assets or properties in custody or possession of the financial service provider”, what third-party assets/properties mean is not defined clearly. More clarity is needed to ensure that creditors do not end up suffering. \n\nWe need specialized provisions incorporating the attributes discussed above for effective resolution of banks and other FIs. \n\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe FRDI Bill was a welcome move as it has many of the important attributes needed for the resolution of financial institutions. Additionally, as opposed to common understanding, the bail-in tool cannot be used as per the government’s fancies and there are many checks and balances in place. However, to further protect depositors, the coverage of depositor insurance may be increased “in accordance with the savings of middle-class households.” A ‘bail-in clause’ should be used only as a last resort and its impact on other creditors should be properly considered. With these few changes, the FRDI Bill can be made even better and it will become more depositor and creditor friendly. A separate resolution regime for banks is something India desperately needs to properly tackle bank failures and ensure stability of the economy. \n[1] John Armour et al, ‘Bank Governance’ in Law, Dan Awrey, Paul L.

        "title": "NFTs and Mapping its Regulation in India",
        "content": "Prakriti Patnaik\nJul 12, 2022\n7 min read\nNFTs and Mapping its Regulation in India\n[Prakriti is an Advocate practicing at the High Court of Odisha and a Legal Research Associate at the Department of Public Policy in KIIT Deemed to be University, Odisha.]\n\nTraditionally, owning anything was primarily physical in nature, but the introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFT(s)) changed it. An NFT is a digital token or asset that cannot be changed throughout time. Fungible tokens are divisible and non-unique like the dollars or fiat currencies, whereas NFTs, are unique and non-divisible. They are a form of deed or title of ownership for a one-of-a-kind, non-replicable item, like an artwork.\n\nNFTs represent the ownership of things on a digital platform that is fully secure and registered in the individual’s name. It is a token or a code that is owned by an individual who is on the block formed under the technology of the blockchain. A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology by which transactions may constitute various information, a number, a code, or a token, which are secured through the process of verifying or substantiating them on the network through the process of cryptocurrency. Therefore, the process of purchasing and selling NFTs is very secure and transparent as the history of NFT ownership is verifiable by blockchain users. The market price of an NFT is contingent on the digital file it substantiates and the demand for purchasing NFTs decides the market value. While NFT trading began circa 2017, it gained popularity in early 2021. \n\nWhat Does an NFT Purchase Constitute?\n\nAn NFT purchase constitutes the purchase of data or a code that indicates to a server that hosts the picture or a video which we all see as an NFT. It is not the image that we purchase but the specific code or data which represents that image that one owns on the blockchain by issuing a unique cryptographic key to represent the item. It is essentially metadata that is minted on a blockchain and stored in the form of a link. Furthermore, it functions as a digitized token that symbolizes real-life objects, like a certificate of ownership for virtual or physical assets. Generally, NFTs are part of the blockchain called “Eth”. Ethereum (Eth) - a cryptocurrency, just like “BTC” or “Doge”. \n\nNFTs could be anything at all - an image, a video, music, sports collections, even tweets, and a signature that can be bought or sold as NFT. However, why should one purchase an NFT, when it is possible to find the exact copy over the internet to download for free? One approach is that NFTs are designed to provide the purchaser with a unique asset incapable of reproduction, in addition to the fact that the artist may still hold original copyright and reproduction rights of the (physical or digital) artwork, moreover, the prints or artworks which are available for ‘free’ online are mostly pirated versions, therefore, free downloads are available but not necessarily legal. As an example, the reader may consider that anyone can purchase a copy print of the famous painting of the Mona Lisa but only one France owns the original. Therefore, NFTs are emerging as a new avenue for artists to earn from their artwork. \n\nIndian Regulatory Framework \n\nThe Government of India has included NFT in the virtual digital assets in the Finance Bill 2022 (Finance Bill) and thus, taxes have been imposed at a 30% rate. Apart from imposing taxes, there are no other regulations that have been made for regulating them in India. As cryptocurrencies are taxable under the Income Tax Act 1962 as ‘virtual digital assets’, hence NFTs are also included as ‘virtual digital assets’ in the Finance Bill, due to the similar concept of trading and storing data in blockchain technology. They can be considered a subset of cryptocurrency. The primary barrier in NFT trading appears to be the uncertainties surrounding the legal legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, through the issuance of a circular, cautioned users by prohibiting them from dealing in virtual currencies (RBI Circular). Soon thereafter, the Supreme Court of India set aside the RBI Circular on 24 March 2020, in the matter of writ petition (civil), Internet and Mobile Association of India v. Reserve Bank of India, which violated the fundamental right of Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution. Thus, the RBI came up with another circular that did not prohibit the users to deal with virtual assets but instructed banks and other entities to carry out necessary due diligence processes for transactions in virtual currencies, in line with the governing standards for the know-your-customer guidelines and anti-money-laundering regulations, to ensure compliance with relevant provisions under the (Indian) Foreign Exchange and Management Act 1999 and International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism 1999. The exchanges of the marketplace are identical to cryptocurrency exchanges. An NFT is auctioned on the platform and the highest bidder gets it. The medium of exchange being cryptocurrencies, a few NFTs can also be bought in dollars or fiat currencies. \n\nRegulation Of Ownership \n\nNFTs represent various types of things, but the digital art form is the most popular form of NFT in India. Consequently, it is a digital copy or a token of an underlying original work, however owing an NFT does not confer the ownership. A smart contract is made available prior to any transaction of the NFT which mentions the terms and conditions of the sale establishing the ownership of the NFT by the buyer, such as if the buyer has the copyright rights or is authorized to use it for personal non-commercial purposes; they are a predefined contract which is drafted by the platform in the form of computer code and processed by the blockchain, however, contracts for NFTs may be in digital form as well due to the grey areas in the regulation. Once the rights are determined in compliance with the Copyright Act 1957 (Copyright Act), the buyer would be treated as the owner of the specific version of the original copyrighted work. The contract comes into effect once the payment has been made and both the parties would be regulated under the laws of the Indian Contract Act 1872. The parties to this smart contract are the seller and the purchaser with the platform companies (Binance, WazirX, etc.) being mere intermediaries. Moreover, irrespective of the contractual terms between the parties concerning among others, the copyright, and the moral rights of the artist (here, seller) are protected under Section 57 of the Copyright Act. Particularly, these rights exist independently and comprise the right to (a) claim authorship of the work; and (b) the right to claim damages for distortion to the work, or any adverse reputation effects. Therefore, the key distinction between the difference between purchasing an NFT and the original work, is that the copyright in the original does not automatically vest in the buyer on the purchase. \n\nSecurities Law Regulation\n\nRenaming cryptocurrency into a crypto asset is brought under the governing ambit of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), under the proposed  Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 (Crypto Bill), to avoid the overlapping between ‘crypto-assets’ and the ‘digital currency’. ‘Cryptocurrency’ is being considered as a ‘digital token’ i.e., a digital representation of the securities that are evidenced on and can be electronically received and stored using distributed ledger technology and therefore brought under the security regulations. However, categorizing NFTs as commodities can create many complications. It would be difficult to regulate them as these digital assets do not have a pre-set value as they are subjected to the free market. Presently, due to a lack of definition, there is ambiguity on whether they are currency or a commodity. \n\nNFTs as Derivatives under Securities Law\n\nAs discussed above, NFTs are yet to be categorized as securities under, among others, the SEBI framework. Some argue that NFTs are merely contracts, while others argue that NFTs are derivatives because of their properties. If the latter is true, it would provide legal backing to a ban on trading. Section 2(ac) of the SCRA states that derivatives include: (a) a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security; or (b) a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities. Additionally, derivatives of a contract are only valid if they are traded and settled on a recognized stock exchange in accordance with the laws of that exchange, as per Section 18A of the SCRA. Therefore, until NFTs are categorized or recognized as ‘securities’, NFT trading platforms will remain largely unregulated.\n\nAs previously noted, being non-fungible, and the inability to be replaced sets them apart from other securities. As a result, designating a particular NFT as security (derivative) would be inappropriate if it simply pertains to an existing asset and is given as a guarantee of the asset's validity. Rather, contract rules should be used as a guide. If classification and authorization will go hand in hand, it may be unlikely for the regulator to classify NFTs as a derivative and permit trading. Be that as it may, there is no requirement of authorization as they are constructed more like platforms for exchanges where a purchase takes place with a payment of a nominal gas fee (it is an amount paid towards the computing energy to validate NFT transaction on the blockchain).  A lot of the leeway has to do with marketing gimmicks, and the Advertising Standards Council of India released guidelines for crypto advertising. \n\nConclusion\n\nCertainly, there are a lot of concerns, particularly when the nation is still struggling with the cryptocurrency conundrum of regulation. The easy trading of NFTs in India requires the legalization of cryptocurrencies. Trading is risky unless and until a definitive decision on the legality of cryptocurrencies is reached. In India, there is currently no specific legal framework for regulating NFTs, hence they are controlled by general contract principles. Nevertheless, if the Crypto Bill would build out exemptions for NFTs apprehending its extensive demand and new regulations would be capable of providing long-term solutions to this new facet of technology. Although the future of NFTs remains uncertain, it is dicey that they are here to stay and be regularized.\nCryptocurrencyNFTBlockchainDigital TokenRegulation\nCorporate Law\n889 views\nPost not marked as liked"

        "title": "Invesco v. Zee: Can Independent Director Nominations by Shareholders be Entertained at EGMs?",
        "content": "Pravah Ranka\nJul 9, 2022\n5 min read\nInvesco v. Zee: Can Independent Director Nominations by Shareholders be Entertained at EGMs?\n[Pravah is a student at Gujarat National Law University.]\n\nOn 22 March 2022, a division bench of the Bombay High Court approved the appeal by Invesco Developing Markets Fund (Invesco) against a verdict dated 26 October 2021, in Invesco Developing Markets Fund (Invesco / Appellant) v. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (Zee / Respondent). The injunction restraining Invesco from calling for and convening an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of Zee was granted by Justice GS Patel at the Bombay High Court on 26 October 2021 (Impugned Order). The Impugned Order concluded that Invesco's proposed resolutions aimed to create an \"illegality\", which would put Zee in breach of various statutory obligations. One of the requests made in the requisition notice was to propose the appointment of independent directors. The key contention was whether Invesco as Zee’s shareholder had the right to suggest nominations for the appointment of independent directors.  This article will attempt to explore the above-stated contention in the context of statutory requirements and related judicial precedents.\n\nThe Role of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Companies Act 2013 (CA 2013), under Section 178, sets out the requirements for a nomination and remuneration committee (NRC). The board of directors of every publicly listed company (Board) must constitute an NRC. Further, under Section 178(3), the NRC is entrusted with formulating criteria for, (a) determining the qualifications, attributes, and independence of a director; and (b) recommending a policy to the Board for, among others, determining remuneration payable to directors, key managerial personnel, and other employees.  The Board is required to consider these recommendations [and how they satisfy the integrity and expertise requirements, which are required under Section 149(6) of the CA 2013].  \n\nCalling an Extraordinary General Meeting \n In Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Escorts Limited  (Escorts), the Supreme Court of India held that for the purpose of Section 100 of the CA 2013, every shareholder of a company has the right, subject to compliance with the procedural requirements prescribed under the CA 2013, to call an EGM.\n                                                                                         Section 100 requires the fulfilment of 2 procedural conditions for an EGM requisition to be valid, which are: (a) the requisition must only be made by the shareholders holding 1/10th of the company’s share capital as on the date of the requisition, and (b) the requisition must be signed by the requisitionists and set out the matters for the consideration under the proposed meeting, and thereafter sent to the registered office of the company.\n Contentions of Invesco / Appellants\n The Appellants contended that the statutory right of a shareholder to call for an EGM cannot be disputed before a court. The ruling in Escorts by the Supreme Court is directly relevant to the circumstances of the current case. The Appellants further contended that a company’s board of directors cannot refuse to convene a meeting in response to a shareholder request if such request complies with the requirements set out in Section 100 of the CA 2013.\n\nContentions of Zee / Respondents\n\nThe Respondent contended that an EGM requisition is unattainable under law as the shareholders have not been vested with the right to recommend nominations for independent directors. The heart of the contention is not the ‘validity’ (legality) of an EGM requisition, but rather the legality of matters proposed to be considered at said EGM. It is settled law that if the matters proposed under the requisition have the effect of inviting the shareholders to do something which at law, they have no power to, the directors stand entitled to refuse to convene the meeting.  Accordingly, there is no concept or statute for the direct nomination or appointment of independent directors by shareholders. It is not open for shareholders to suggest a management change or restructuring in a manner inconsistent with the applicable statutory framework. \n\nIn view of the above, the Respondent concluded that the EGM requisition to appoint 2 independent directors was unattainable under the law since shareholders do not have the right to recommend such nominations for independent directors in the first instance. \n\nIt is a settled principle that if an EGM aims at passing, in effect, ineffective or invalid resolutions, then, as a matter of commercial practicality, the directors need not call such an EGM.  Accordingly, the directors will be entitled to refuse convening a meeting if the outcome of such EGM would be unmaintainable.\n\nAuthor’s Observations\n\nAccepting Nominations via a Harmonious Interpretation of Section 100 and Section 178 of the CA 2013  \n\nIn Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., it was held that \"a business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.\". In Centron Industrial Alliance Limited v. Pravin Kantilal Vakil, it was held that even if the form in which the proposed resolution is called is irregular, the board of directors is compelled to call the EGM if \"ultimately a decision taken in a meeting can be implemented in a legal manner\". In the present case, it must be understood that the shareholders are not trying to overtake the authority of the NRC to formulate policy and make appropriate recommendations. Academics have suggested that since the shareholders are only giving nominations to the NRC through this EGM, the NRC can subsequently recommend these names as per the CA 2013. In view of the above analysis, it may be argued that shareholders’ requests, if harmoniously interpreted under the provisions of Sections 100 and 178 of the CA 2013, can be legally effectuated. \n Corporate Governance and Shareholder Primacy\n\nThe objective of Section 100 of the CA 2013 is to allow shareholders to seek emergency meetings. Therefore, providing suggestions for nominations is not a violation of the CA 2013, particularly the provisions of Section 100 of the CA 2013. Therefore, where shareholders only seek an opportunity to be heard, terming such attempts to voice concerns as “illegal” may be extreme. It may also be noted that independent director nominations are being welcomed as advisory requests in various jurisdictions. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Division of Corporation Finance) recently issued a staff legal bulletin stating that the shareholder proposals should state “as clearly as possible” the course of action that the proponent believes the company should follow as an “advisory request” for company action.\n\nConclusion\n\nTherefore, the objective of Section 100 of the CA 2013 is to allow shareholders to ask for a meeting and provide suggestions. Such action is neither barred generally under the CA 2013, nor specifically under Section 100 of the CA 2013. \n\nA reference may be made here to the J.J. Irani report, which stated that the law must balance the need for effective corporate decision-making based on fair consensus. Nonetheless, a majority of Indian listed entities continue to be promoter-driven and controlled entities. Therefore, the protection of minority shareholder interests assumes even more importance. Indian courts, therefore, must consider allowing such EGMs with a view to uphold minority interests and promote fairness in corporate governance. \nCorporateCompanies ActShareholder ActivismInvescoIndependent DirectorEGM\nCorporate Law\n296 views\n2 likes.

        "title": "Activism in Boardroom: Trends, Impediments & Windows of Opportunity in Indian Shareholder Activism",
        "content": "Samrudh Kopparam\nJul 7, 2022\n6 min read\nActivism in Boardroom: Trends, Impediments & Windows of Opportunity in Indian Shareholder Activism\n[Samrudh is a student at Jindal Global Law School.]\n\nWith increased volatility in the stock market, public shareholders have begun to exert a substantial influence on companies in which they hold their shares. The emerging wave of participative governance accompanied by proxy advisory firms, technological advancement, and regulatory reforms spearheaded by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have contributed to the colloquially termed phenomenon of Shareholder Activism. An example of such activism in the contemporary context is the recent show of no-confidence by the shareholders of Vedanta Limited in the special resolution against adopting annual financial accounts and reappointment of independent director UK Sinha. Similarly, the shareholders of Eicher Motors Limited, (i.e., the parent company of Royal Enfield) have also voted against the reappointment of the Managing Director (MD), Siddhartha Lal. However, Vedanta’s accounts were adopted, and Siddhartha Lal was reappointed with revised remuneration due to promoter and public non-institutional support. This transition of shareholder attitude from passivity to an active and combative role has recently been observed in the Invesco-Zee case. By analyzing the case, this article seeks to answer whether combative activism is feasible in the Indian context.\n\nTracing the Changing Trends of Shareholder Activism in India\n\nShareholder activism can be defined as a proactive effort to change the firms’ behaviour or influence management functions. Furthermore, it is a living phenomenon that evolves with changing socio-economic conditions. In the Indian context, we observe shareholder activism being molded into different forms. Firstly, we observe passive activism that involves investors who vote with their feet. If such investors are unsatisfied with the company’s management, they sell their shares and exit the firm. This unpretentious practice of the ‘wall street walk’ indirectly inculcates a disciplinary effect and garners accountability within the company. Passive activism was prevalent post-independence, with equity markets being substantially shallow. However, in the contemporary context, the efficacy of such activism would be negligible unless a prominent investor who wields a substantial shareholding and influences managerial decisions exits the company. Secondly, introducing liberalization policies and opening up the Indian economy attracted Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). This ventilated participative activism, wherein global corporate governance standards influenced shareholders to assume a more significant managerial role. The basic principle of such activism lies in the assumption that greater participation from non-institutional shareholders could impact the outcome of corporate decisions. Thirdly, post the global financial crisis of 2008 and its impact on the stock market, shareholders became increasingly cautious and took greater responsibility for monitoring their investments. This paved the path to contemporary ‘interactive’ activism, which has been instrumental in developing engagement between shareholders and the company vis-à-vis managerial affairs. We observe the fourth kind of shareholder activism (i.e., combative activism) emerging with the slow westernization of the economy. In combative activism, shareholders voice their dissatisfaction by resorting to litigation through derivative or direct action to ensure that their interests are not adversely affected. Despite such activism being nascent, it caught the public-eye through the Invesco-Zee fiasco, wherein proxy fights and litigation were employed to ameliorate inept management.\n\nBattle of Thin Lines: Shareholder Activism versus Proxy Control \n\nAt the crux of the Invesco-Zee saga is the interpretation of Section 100 of the Companies Act 2013 (Companies Act). At the outset, Section 100(2)(a) is indispensable for shareholder activism as it empowers shareholders holding at least 10% of paid-up share capital with the right to call Extraordinary General Meetings (EGM) and propose special resolutions. Additionally, Section 100(3) requires a requisition notice containing the proposed resolutions to be sent to the Board of Directors (BOD). Section 100(4) permits shareholders to hold the EGM themselves if the BOD does not take any steps to call the EGM within 21 days of the notice. In this regard, Invesco, which held an aggregate 17.88% shareholding, sent a requisition notice to Zee to hold an EGM. The resolutions to be considered in the EGM were removing MD Punit Goenka and appointing 6 independent directors. Subsequently, Zee refused to call the EGM as the requisition was allegedly illegal. Zee also contended that the requisition contravened several laws such as SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (SEBI LODR), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting-Policy Guidelines for Up linking of Television Channels from India 2011 (MIB Guidelines), and SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011 (SEBI Takeover Regulations). These contentions culminated in Invesco approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which ordered Zee to favourably consider the request for EGM. Subsequently, Zee approached the Bombay High Court, which at the first instance contravenes Section 430 of the Companies Act, conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the special courts to hear company law matters. This resulted in creating a jurisdictional tussle between the civil courts and NCLT. Notably, the single-judge bench ruled in favour of Zee, albeit with a flawed rationale by encroaching the jurisdiction of the NCLT and ruling on the validity of the proposed resolutions– which ran contrary to established precedents. Consequently, Invesco appealed to a division bench of the Bombay High Court, which settled positions of law vis-à-vis shareholder activism.\n\nAnalyzing the division-bench judgment, let us first demystify the thin line of difference between shareholder activism and hostile takeovers. The SEBI Takeover Regulations govern hostile takeovers and defines control under Regulation 2(1)(e) as the right to appoint a majority of the directors or control managerial decisions by virtue of shareholding. Therefore, the question arises, did Invesco attempt a hostile takeover by gaining ‘control’? The answer can be inferred from the proposed resolutions and the precedent set in Arcelor Mittal v. Satish Kumar. In this case, the Supreme Court held that when an acquirer has the power to appoint a majority of the directors, he can be said to be in ‘control.’ Furthermore, only when an acquirer is the prime driving force of the targeted company can he be in ‘control.’ In this regard, the resolutions proposed the appointment of six independent directors in contrast to the threshold of twelve specified in the articles of association. This results in appointing half of the directors, (i.e., 50%) and not a majority (i.e., >50%). Moreover, the appointment is of independent and not nominee directors, which does not put Invesco in a power position. Therefore, it can be asserted that Invesco engaged in combative activism as it did not hold the requisite ‘control’ for a hostile takeover.\n\nA Window of Opportunity: Significance of the Invesco-Zee Judgment\n\nThe judgment settled two crucial notions of law. It clarified that shareholders have the right to appoint directors by a harmonized interpretation of Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR and provisions of the Companies Act. The court elucidated that whilst Regulation 17 requires appointments to go through a nomination and remuneration committee, it merely envisages situations of appointments made by the BOD and not activist investors. Consequently, Section 160(1) of the Companies Act is attracted, which upholds the shareholders’ power to propose candidates for being appointed as directors. Moreover, Regulation 17 mandates the presence of an executive director, which is lacking if Punit Goenka is ousted. In this regard, the court cited Section 203(4) of the Companies Act, which allows the executive director position to be filled within 6 months of vacancy. Additionally, Zee contended the requisition to be non-compliant with Clause 5.10 of MIB Guidelines that mandates prior permission before effectuating a change in the BOD. In this regard, the court opined that in the interest of corporate democracy, permission subsequent to the EGM may be taken for the appointment of directors. Furthermore, the court reaffirmed the right of a shareholder to call an EGM as it comes within the purview of the shareholders’ indefeasible right to hold the BOD accountable. On this point, heavy reliance was placed on LIC v. Escorts Limited, wherein the apex court held that shareholders’ right to demand the BOD to call an EGM cannot be curbed if the requisition meets the requirements of Section 100 of the Companies Act. Furthermore, the court opined that no court could restrain a notice requesting EGM. In this manner, the Invesco-Zee case has been pivotal in striking a balance between the board’s powers and shareholders’ rights, thereby facilitating a new wave of shareholder activism led by FIIs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Invesco-Zee case illustrates a manifestation of the change in governance amongst the shareholders of a company. Such combative activism was bound to face traditional resistance, mainly due to impediments such as the phenomenon of family capitalism rampant within promoter-driven companies and poison-pill mechanisms unique to the Indian context. Furthermore, whilst the courts clarified the shareholder’s right to hold EGMs and appoint directors, it missed an opportunity to demarcate the powers of the civil court and the NCLT. The court did not adequately engage with the consequences of interfering with corporate democracy. Consequently, we observe that Invesco could not hold an EGM for over 6-months, thereby stripping the legislative intent of Section 100. During this period, Zee announced its merger with Sony, which improved Zee’s grasp on the Indian over-the-top sector and empowered the promoter family with greater control. Accordingly, despite a favourable judgment by the division bench, Invesco decided to call off the EGM and support the merger. Therefore, as evidenced by the Invesco-Zee tussle and ongoing Yes Bank-Dish TV facade, such combative shareholder activism is currently infeasible in the Indian context.\nCorporateInvescoZeeShareholder ActivismCompanies Act\nCorporate Law\n328 views\n13 likes.

        "title": "Orator Marketing v. Samtex Desinz: A Case Comment",
        "content": "Diya Dave\nJul 4, 2022\n6 min read\nOrator Marketing v. Samtex Desinz: A Case Comment\n[Diya is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nIndia has had a very unstable insolvency law regime where the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC or Code) has provided a breakthrough. Unlike the previously lopsided insolvency laws, IBC has well-distinguished concepts of financial and operational debts, a distinction that carries importance when creditors go for a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). Section 5(7) defines a financial creditor (FC) as “any person to whom a ‘financial debt’ is owed”. Thus, the definition of financial debt holds significance.\n\nSection 5(8) of the IBC defines financial debt as “a debt along with interest, if any, which is disbursed against the consideration for the time value of money and includes- (a) money borrowed against the payment of interest…”. The time value of money (TVM) is the most essential element of financial debt and is usually reflected by the interest charged against a loan. In the case of DF Deutsche Forfait AG v. Uttam Galva Steel Limited, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) said that a “transaction is financial (and not operational) if money is lent in contemplation of returns in the form of interest”. However, interest is not the only factor reflecting the TVM. For instance, in the case of Shailesh Sangani v. Joel Cardoso, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) held that interest is not the only indicator of financial debt but the only consideration is that a loan should be given “against the time value of money, with or without bearing interest”. Therefore, these rulings give rise to a dilemma about what exactly constitutes the TVM. \n\nFurther, the definition of time value in the Black’s Law Dictionary is “the price associated with the length of time that an investor must wait until an investment matures or the related income is earned”. In majority of the cases, the price associated with delayed time is paid in the form of interest. Hence, the recent Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Orator Marketing Private Limited v. Samtex Desinz Private Limited raised eyebrows as it expressly held that interest-free loans can constitute financial debt in case of defaults. \n\nCase Summary\n\nBackground  \n\nM/s Sameer Sales Private Limited (lender) granted an interest-free loan to its sister company, M/s Samtex Desinz Private Limited (corporate debtor) for a period of two years. The debt was payable to M/s. Orator Marketing Private Limited (FC), a third party, who filed for a CIRP when the loan was defaulted. The contention before the courts was whether a loan given without an interest can be ‘financial debt’ under Section 5(8) of the Code.\n\nThe NCLT and the NCLAT dismissed the claim stating that an interest-free loan is not financial debt due to a lack of “consideration for time value for money”. Thus, the petitioners are not FCs and cannot initiate a CIRP. \n\nObservations of the Apex Court\n\nSurprisingly, the Supreme Court reversed the NCLAT judgment and asked the NCLT to revive the petition for CIRP. The court took a contrary view in its landmark ruling giving the following rationale. \n\nLegislative Intent\n\nIn order to understand the overall object and purpose of the Code, the Court looked at the legislative intent behind it. The court cited Innoventive Industries Limited v. ICICI Bank Limited. (Innoventive Industries) where Nariman, J. asserted that default must be interpreted in the widest possible manner as per Section 3(12) of the Code. Reading all definitions and the larger purpose of the code in conjunction with one another, the court concluded that a CIRP can be initiated by an FC whenever there is a debt that has been defaulted, which holds true for the present case. \n\nS.5(8) is Inclusive and Not Exhaustive\n\nThe court remarked that the tribunals had misinterpreted the definition of 'financial debt', ignoring the words “if any”. It read the definition in the sense that financial debt is the principal amount due in respect to any loan granted along with interest, if there is any. In case there is no interest payable, the financial debt only amounts to the principal that is due.\n\nMoreover, the court also laid emphasis on the word “includes” in Section 5(8). Citing the Privy Council decision in Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps [(1899) AC 99], it opined that when a definition mentions the word “includes”, it is meant to enlarge the scope of definition. It will be exhaustive only when the provision sufficiently indicates otherwise. The court opined that the section is not exhaustive and has a larger scope than what has been previously interpreted. \n\nComment and Analysis\n\nThe Supreme Court looked at the concept of financial debt narrowly. The series of judgments that have come forth with respect to the IBC show that the code is supposed to be read in a unison, meaning that the major scheme of the code must be given importance. However, the judgment is an individualistic interpretation of Section 5(8) of the Code, in the sense that it was only based on a literal, word-by-word reading of the text which forms the core of its critique. \n\nCommercial Effects of Borrowing\n\nThe court said that the loan given in this case has “obvious” commercial effects due to it being granted to fulfil commercial requirements. Court’s understanding of the “commercial effects of borrowing” seems vague as the court fails to provide sufficient explanation for the same. The phrase “commercial effects of borrowing” was explained in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited and Another v. Union of India and Others. In that case, the court said that the word “commercial would generally involve transactions having profit as their main aim”. In the present case, the objective was not to earn profit as there was no interest charged against the loan even after the due date of payment expired. \n\nThe court justified its reasoning by saying that the profit can be realised in any form and manner. In Kolla Koteswara Rao v. S.K. Srihari Raju, the court observed that since an interest-free loan and a waiver of loan amount leads to a profit for the corporate debtor (CD), it must have the commercial effects of borrowing. The element of profit is largely seen from the perceptive of the creditor who realises it in the form of interest. Considering the lender and the CD were sister companies, it could be argued that the profit could be realised in the form of commercial growth of the debtor company. However, applying this rationale to the present case, the commercial revival of the debtor company would be profitable to the lender as opposed to the FC as both entities are separate in this case. The creditor, in fact, had no incentive in the said transaction, and thus, it is a mere financial aid provided by one party to the other. \n\nTime Value of Money\n\nThe court overlooked a primary element of financial debt, the TVM. The Supreme Court has overturned multiple precedents which have asserted that TVM is reflected by the element of interest in a loan transaction. For instance, cases such as Shreyans Realtors v. Saroj Realtors and Narendra Kumar Agarwal v. Monotrone Leasing have time and again asserted that interest-free loans are not financial debt and that interest is the most common indicator of the TVM. \n\nAn assertive interpretation of the TVM was given in the case of Nikhil Mehta v. AMR Infrastructure (Nikhil Mehta) where the NCLAT said that “the legislature has included such financial transactions in the definition of 'Financial debt' which are usually for a sum of money received today to be paid for over a period of time in a single or series of payments in future. It may also be a sum of money invested today to be repaid over a period of time in a single or series of instalments to be paid in future”. Paying the time value is a vital element according to Section 5(8) as that factor must be present irrespective of there being an interest. Thus, the rationale of the court in saying that mention of the words “if any” gives a free pass to eliminate the TVM factor, is flawed and superficial. The interpretation of the legislative intent is also very narrow in Orator Marketing as opposed to Nikhil Mehta. In the latter, the interpretation is based on the practical and popular meaning of the phrase “time value” which is monetary value of the time for which the money is borrowed.  \n\nA report by the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee has mentioned that for one to qualify as an FC, his relation with the CD should be purely financial. In the present case, the transaction was not entirely financial as the no-interest clause was added only due to the relation of sister companies between the parties. Further, the court made an analogy with cases like Innoventive Industries and Swiss Ribbons Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Others noting that debenture holders and fixed deposit holders can also initiate CIRP as FCs. However, the court fails to note that both debentures and fixed deposits have the element of time value present in some or the other form and, therefore, directly fall under the purview of Section 5(8).  \n\nConclusion\n\nThe judgment will have massive impact on the future insolvency proceedings in India. This will give rise to excessive claims as the number of unsecured transactions in the country is very high. The reasoning of the court was very narrow, derived by only a bare reading of Section 5(8) in isolation with the Code. This judgment blurs the line between unsecured creditors and large secured financial institutions and banks. Clearly, the latter holds more importance because they give huge amounts of loans for longer periods, non-payment of which can lead to serious loss to the trade and economy. In the author's opinion, this degree difference was ignored by the court while understanding the larger scheme of the code. \nCodeInsolvencyFinancial DebtTime Value of Money\nInsolvency Law\n378 views\n5 likes.

        "title": "Leniency Regime for Single Economic Entities: An Unsettled Dilemma",
        "content": "Kinjal Keya, Aditya Pratap Singh\nJun 27, 2022\n6 min read\nLeniency Regime for Single Economic Entities: An Unsettled Dilemma\n[Kinjal and Aditya are students at Chanakya National Law University.]\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI / Commission) in its recent ruling in the In Re: Cartelisation by Shipping Lines Case has penalised four motor companies for their anti- competitive conduct in the maritime transportation sector. Apart from being a meticulously investigated instance of cartelisation, this case has major significance from the standpoint of the ever evolving yet relatively nascent leniency regime of Indian competition law. \n\nIn this case, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (OP-3) and Nissan Motor Car Carrier Company (OP-4) submitted before the CCI that there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship amongst them and that they constitute a Single Economic Entity (SEE); therefore, OP-4 must be granted all the benefits that OP-3 may receive in terms of reduction in penalty in consonance with its priority status. However, the CCI rejected the plea stating that the concept of ‘group’ or SEE is inherently unknown and inapplicable to leniency proceedings and that the Competition Act 2002 (Act) has not extended the definition of ‘group’ to leniency proceedings.\n\nIn this article, we will highlight the shortcomings of such rejections and subsequently provide for a constructive solution for addressing such inconsistencies which is in consonance with the object and spirit of the Act and also the well international established international practices in this regard.  \n\nLeniency for the Single Economic Entity: A Missing Piece in Leniency Puzzle  \n\nThe ground of reasoning relied upon by the CCI in denying uniform benefits to the SEE in the Shipping Lines Cartel Case is erroneous as it does not differentiate between the application of the SEE doctrine for the purpose of Section 3 analysis (ascertaining the anti-competitive conduct of entities) from its application for the purpose of granting leniency which refers to granting reduction in penalty to the entities.  \n\nThe provision for leniency is not concerned with the question about existence of liability but rather deliberates upon the extent of the liability which is invoked after the anti-competitive conduct has been ascertained and it empowers the CCI to grant reduction in penalty to the member of the cartel who provides full, true and vital information regarding the cartel.  A failure in recognising this crucial distinction primarily raises two problems:\n\nFirstly, if a subsidiary (which had operated in the cartel along with its parent company) fulfils its duty of cooperation during investigation but fails to file a separate application for lesser penalty, it would be devoid of a reduction in penalty imposed by the commission. \n\nSecondly, there is unreasonable discrimination in the numerical extent of the reduction in penalty granted to the subsidiary and the parent company even though they form an SEE and there exists unity of economic interest among them. This would mean that their conduct or misconduct is for the benefit of the same unit but the financial burden on their turnover is different as they are subjected to the marker system and given priority according to the sequential order of their separate applications.  \n\nLegal Inconsistencies: Interpreting Parent Act and Implementing the International Decisional Practice \n\nThe current practice of not applying the SEE doctrine to the leniency proceeding needs to be securitised primarily on two bases, its inconsistency with the Act and direct contradiction with the established decisional practice of the European Union. \n\nAs per the Act, lesser penalty is granted to an ‘enterprise’ and Section 2(h) of the Act describes this term as inclusive of the other investments made by the company including acquisitions, holdings, units or divisions. The Lesser Penalty Regulation of 2009 explicitly clarifies that the meaning of ‘applicant’ has to be construed according to the term ‘enterprise’ under the Act. The terminology resembles similarity with the concept of ‘undertaking’ under the EU Law which is inclusive of subsidiaries and other forms of holdings. \n\nTherefore, the question of joint application does not arise as the parent statute itself creates considerable scope for the SEE to benefit from the leniency programme of CCI in capacity of an “enterprise” through a single application filed either by the parent or subsidiary that form part of the SEE. \n\nIn the Shipping Lines Cartel Case, despite the significant evidence regarding OP-3 and OP-4 constituting a SEE, the requirement for filing separate applications was emphasised by the CCI and different percentages of reductions were granted to the concerned companies. Such an approach is violative of the practise of uniformly granting leniency to the entire SEE established in the European Union through a series of decisions which includes the RWE Case, where the General Court (GC) observed that the term “undertaking” has to construed on the basis of the nature of the economic entity. Further in the SKW Ruling and LG Display Case, the GC reiterated that the term “undertaking” refers to the economic entity as it exists at the time of the submission of the application and the concept of undertaking used in the leniency notice is identical to the term used in Article 101 TFEU. The GC, added that it is not only the entity submitting the application which benefits from Commission’s leniency program, but the whole undertaking. Therefore, in Shipping Lines Cartel Case, the unity of economic interest that existed among OP-3 and OP-4 in capacity of a SEE should have been ideally analysed by the CCI in more detail.\n\nFurthermore, in the Organ Peroxides Commission Case, it was observed that when a company submits evidence for benefiting from a reduction in fines, any reduction granted will benefit the whole undertaking of which such company forms part. Therefore, upon cooperation or vital disclosure by any part of the SEE, the whole SEE would be eligible for uniform leniency benefits. However, in spite of the fact that in the Shipping Lines Cartel Case, both OP-3 and OP-4 have duly cooperated in the investigation, the CCI failed to adopt a uniform method of granting leniency to both entities. Moreover, in the Rubber Chemicals Commission Decision though the facts dealt with a scenario involving joint ventures, the observation is pertinent in answering the question regarding leniency to the SEE. The European Commission (EC) observed that if the parent company has exercised a decisive influence on the joint venture, they can be considered as an SEE and subsequently, the parent company could benefit from the leniency application filed by the joint venture even without being a separate applicant.\n\nAdditionally, through its orders in the International Removal Services Commission Decision and the Hoechst Commission Decision, the EC has further emphasised that the concept of leniency applies to the entire undertaking and not the specific legal entity which has officially applied for it. \n\nHence, the international practice recognises the use of SEE doctrine in matters of leniency, and its implementation in the Indian context would serve as a viable measure for overcoming the discriminatory variation in terms of the exact numerical extent of the reduction granted to companies or procedural compulsions such as separate applications meted to the companies that form part of an SEE.\n\nStrengthening the Leniency Mechanism for Future Challenges \n\nThe Indian practice of demanding separate applications from components of the same SEE fails to address certain modern-complex forms of anti-competitive agreements that may seem hypothetical to the Indian jurisprudence presently but have been a constant point of contention in other mature jurisdictions such as the EU. \n\nSuch complex anti-competitive arrangements include the scenario wherein an entity tries to achieve its anti-competitive purpose through cartelisation although without being a direct member. For example, in Sumal Judgement, the European Court of Justice had made observations regarding the situation when a subsidiary can be held liable for anti-competitive conduct of its parent. In such an arrangement, the subsidiary implements the object of the cartel based on information accessed through its parent company which forms part of that cartel. Subsequently, when the investigation takes place, upon being a non-member of the cartel, the subsidiary is barred from filing a separate application for lesser penalty, and its only recourse would be to benefit from its parent’s application which is currently discouraged in the Indian competition law practice. \n\nTherefore, by duly recognising a single leniency application for the entire SEE, we can effectively deal with various unconventional forms of cartelisation and also present a great incentive for more whistle blowers to come to the commission without the burden of obliging with excessive compliance mechanism.\n\nConclusion \n\nIncorporation of best practices from other jurisdictions is an effective way for developing robust domestic leniency mechanisms. One such practice is reflected in the consistent approach adopted by the French Competition Authority through its leniency program under Articles L. 464- 2 IV and R. 464-5 of the Commercial Code which endorses that all entities belonging to “a single economic unit” at the time of the leniency application are eligible to be covered under the benefits of the leniency programme. Such practices can be analysed, and if deemed fit, can be incorporated in the Indian leniency regime to establish consistency and clarity regarding the application of SEE. \nCompetition Commission of IndiaLeniency RegimeCompetition Act\nCompetition Law\n285 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "The INDEX Act: A Ban on Free Reigning by Indexers",
        "content": "Priyanshi Jain, Simran Lunagariya\nJun 26, 2022\n6 min read\nThe INDEX Act: A Ban on Free Reigning by Indexers\n[Priyanshi and Simran are students at Institute of Law, Nirma University.]\n\nThe pioneer of passive funds, John C Bogle, had cited his fears against the increasing supremacy of index funds. He stated that index funds were successful at the time of their inception, but he had a strong hunch that down the lane, index funds may do too much for their good. The inflows from the active investments have been plunging while, on the other hand, passive investments have been progressing, accounting for 60% of the equity assets. However, the recent instance of fund investors missing out on Tesla’s appreciation depicts that buying the haystack has done no good to fund investors. \n\nThe three giant indexers in US, namely BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have not developed a level playing field and have gained control of the market. This concentrated corporate ownership has upended the voting powers of the fund investors. \n\nTherefore, to deconcentrate the ownership and restore the voting powers of the fund investors, the INDEX (Investor Democracy Expected) Act (INDEX Act or Act) has been introduced in the United States. That said, how this will ever be brought to India, where the passive funds are still at the development stage, is still riddled with ambiguity. The authors, through this blog, juxtapose the growth of passive funds and the declining interest of the fund investors. To begin with, the authors list down the issues which have significantly helped in the inception of the INDEX Act in the US. Second, the authors seek to emphasize the above fallacy in the Indian context. Lastly, they state a few recommendations to address this problem. \n\nThe Advent of INDEX Act – A Saving Grace? \n\nThe backdrop of this Act resulted from two problems: firstly, there was significant concentration of power in the hands of a few indexers. The passive indexing caused the dispersed shareholding to be so concentrated that it began to distort the market. The studies have shown that the three indexers accounted for almost 1/4th of the total votes at the annual meeting, thus raising the level of influence in discussions. Secondly, the question about the casting of voting rights remained unvoiced. There was an interesting controversy; the index advisors of passive funds voted proxies as per their discretion and gave little regard, if any, to the fund investors, while the fund investor, who were the real owners, did not have any say in the voting decision. For instance, the American retirement funds have been used as per the whims of the indexers for a long. \n\nTherefore, in one fell swoop, it is significant that indexers have failed to act as a steward. Together, these problems created an absurd paradox: the fund investors had no powers to change the corporate governance scenario; on the other hand, the indexers had too much control to turn the table in their favour. To remedy these issues, the INDEX Act was brought into force. The Act stipulates that the indexers have to dutifully pass through the vote to proxies only as per the instructions given by the fund investors and not as per their own choice. \n\nMore often than not, these indexers succumb to the pressure from the activists who do not have any vested interest in the issuer’s company and only under the guise of political agenda, try to fulfil their demands. Therefore, the Act will change the corporate governance framework initially governed by the shifting of the votes by three dominant players and take account of the unheard voices of the fund investors. \n\nAdditionally, implementation of “pass-through voting instructions” will be relatively easy as the proxies are usually part of the fund. Therefore, it could be established without any legislative and regulatory measures. The indexers can also conduct an issue-centric survey and record how the fund investors respond to each corporate governance issue. In this case, indexers will be hard-pressed to act as a steward. \n\nIn a nutshell, this Act will decrease fund investors’ apathy towards voting, make indexers more accountable to ultimate investors by way of a proxy voting system and mitigate the risk of concentrated corporate ownership. This will also extend the fundamental principle to index funds, that the principals and not the agents should vote. Moreover, since passive investment is all the rage today, it might overtake active funds. Therefore, it becomes all the more necessary than ever to account for the rights of fund investors at a time when some proposals seemed to have been blocked. This can be done by way of fund investors’ instructions and by allowing the voting mechanism to be solely governed as per the wishes of fund investors.  \n\nIndian Context\n\nIndexers in India refrained from voting on almost 90% of issues before 2010. Mutual Fund absenteeism fell, and participation surged significantly after SEBI's rule in 2010 and a subsequent amendment in 2013 on voting. The proportion of those who do not vote has declined because of the SEBI’s proactive measures. During the 2014-2015 fiscal year, 20.9% of total votes consisted of absenteeism, according to data. During the 2018-2019 fiscal year, this figure decreased to 12.5%.\n\nIn the past, the majority of passive funds have \"voted in favour\" and expressed minimal issues in the majority of resolutions so far. It is rare for financial institutions to ignore management recommendations, even in extreme circumstances like the YES Bank’s fiasco. Consequently, the passive fund's stewardship function was underutilised. They, on the other hand, did not care about their stewardship responsibility until the Stewardship Code of 2020 came into effect. Though not mandatory, the stewardship code instilled a feeling of guilt in passive funds to actively engage in the governance of the firm they invest in to protect the rights of fund investors.\n\nDuring the 2010 and 2013 mandates of SEBI, the passive funds were needed to document and report the basis for using their voting rights in corporations, but they were not obligated to vote. SEBI mandated that funds vote on all corporate resolutions on 5 March 2021. The regulator requires all schemes to be voted upon beginning on 1 April 2022, even if the company's equity shares are held passively via an index fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). Now, indexers can cast votes at the scheme level if they disagree with a fund house's decision, which was previously limited to the fund house. Indexers are now required to certify to the fund house's trustees every quarter that the votes taken have not been influenced by any cause except the best interests of the fund investors. The public disclosure of the votes that funds cast on various resolutions provided by their investee corporations is also to be disclosed. \n\nThis indicates that Indian regulators have prioritised enhancing the voting participation of passive funds in the decision-making of investee companies. The new notification of SEBI has increased the voting power of fund management companies. Furthermore, high-weighting index funds in India's most important sectors and equities often lead to concentration issues. While several equities have rallied recently, the remainder of the index has been stagnant or declining. SEBI created new indices to reduce concentration concerns in ETFs and index products. Broad market indices should have no more than a 25% stock weight, whereas sector/thematic indexes should have a 35% stock weight. However, these guidelines still enable concentrated index fund portfolios.\n\nTherefore, due to indexer’s right to vote and market concentration issues, India is likely to face asset management firms’ undue influence in the proxy voting patterns of these funds. The index fund market in India is in the developing stage and is vulnerable to face issues similar to the USA. The new guideline requires the management companies to work in the best interest of fund investors. However, the regulators must also consider “instruction-based voting” (similar to INDEX Act) to prevent fund management companies from prioritising their interests above those of the investors in future.\n\nRecommendations for INDEX Act\n\nINDEX Act has been a positive initiative in regulating proxy voting malpractices in business since its implementation. However, the following proposals should be included in the legislation to make it more effective. \n\nAt times the passive funds' ownership is extremely intermediated and dispersed, making it difficult and costly to identify shareholders. Indexers may also struggle to communicate directly with investors. These specific challenges raise costs for funds to carry out regulatory duties to get shareholder approval every time. When funds and advisors vote, it is challenging to secure vote confirmations due to the many intermediaries involved, from transfer agents to tabulators. Concerns over the precision and speed of vote confirmations may resurface. While legislators are obligated to solve these difficulties, they may incorporate intermediaries, such as transfer agents, to convey vote-confirmation information and utilise other ways utilising artificial intelligence to secure votes.\nIndex funds should have an independent supervisory board with full authority for all corporate governance-related decisions.\nThe Index Act shall include penalties for violations; otherwise, it would not be an effective measure.\nIndex funds shall do timely and complete public disclosure of their voting procedures and public record of each interaction with company executives. This would go a long way toward fostering a culture of openness and cooperation in government.\n\nConclusion\n\nGlobally, the market for passive funds is increasing due to a large number of individual investors. The abuses of proxy voting by the three largest index fund managers in the United States have caused several repercussions for industry participants. The introduction of the INDEX Act is a positive development, notwithstanding certain limitations. The legislation would serve as a model for other nations whose passive fund markets are developing. While India is seeing an increase in the engagement of passive funds in proxy voting, it would be prudent to learn from American reforms to minimise future inequities.\nPassive FundsIndex FundsINDEX Act\nCorporate Law\n171 views\n6 likes.

The Code provides for a mechanism to revive an ailing company and authorizes a corporate debtor, operational creditor or financial creditor to present an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) and elude liquidation.\n\nBy dint of the process, the control of the corporate debtor is legally endowed to the Committee of Creditor (CoC), which generally consists of the financial creditors. The CoC is considered as a decisive authority in the decision-making process during the insolvency resolution and is empowered with the control of the corporate debtor. Every action of the resolution professional necessitates ratification of the CoC. Nonetheless, the paramount responsibility of the CoC is to examine and approve the most appropriate resolution plan in compliance with Section 30(4) of the Code. Once the resolution plan is approved by the CoC, it is submitted before the NCLT for its approval. Subsequently, when the NCLT approves the resolution plan, it operates as a formal order and is legally binding on all the stakeholders.\n\nIn recent times, the Adjudicating Authority has disapproved several resolution plans on the ground that the principles of fairness, objectivity and reasonableness were not observed by the CoC while approving the resolution plan. Hence, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has proposed a code of conduct for the CoC to consolidate the insolvency regime and to regulate the conduct of the CoC. It consists of certain ethical norms that the CoC is expected to comply with, while carrying out its day-to-day operations. Further, the proposed code of conduct seeks to safeguard other stakeholders against the arbitrary approval of a resolution plan which may be disadvantageous to their interests.     \n\nIrregularities in Functioning of CoC\n\nThe Code is formulated on the concept of the creditor in control model, wherein the CoC is the primary decision-making authority. The Adjudicating Authority earlier considered CoC as the sovereign decision-making body, however, its commercial wisdom and conduct has been subsequently questioned in series of judgments. In Jindal Saxena Financial Services Private Limited v. Mayfair Capital Private Limited, the NCLT condemned the delay in the insolvency resolution process due to the incompetency of representatives of the financial creditor. Subsequently, the Adjudicating Authority in K Shashidhar, MD, Kamineni Steel and Power India Limited v. Kamineni Steel and Power India Limited and Others, enunciated that the deliberate delay on the part of financial creditors in approving the resolution plan is against the spirit of the Code. It further held that the conduct of the committee of creditors is unreasonable and the Reserve Bank of India should monitor the mechanism of the concerned banks with respect to non-performing assets. However, the apex court in Essar Steel case held that the time frame is merely directive and not mandatory in nature, hence, the adjudicating authority can extend the time frame under certain circumstances. \n\nSection 12 of the Code promotes timely disposal of cases to maximize the value of assets belonging to the corporate debtor. This was introduced to rectify the loopholes in the Sick Industrial Companies Act 1985. However, due to incompetent representatives, deliberate delay by the committee of creditors and lackadaisical conduct of the financial creditors, the CIRP process becomes less favourable. \n\nIn Bank of Baroda v. Mr Sisir Kumar Appikatla and Others, the Adjudicating Authority did not grant its approval to the resolution plan proposed by the CoC.  The commercial wisdom of the committee was questioned as it deliberately disguised the restructure plan as resolution plan. It condemned act of CoC for taking undue advantage of the powers vested under the Code. Further, in case of Andhra Bank v. Sterling Biotech Limited and Others, the Adjudicating Authority disapproved the resolution plan as the majority of the members of CoC misused their voting power whereby former promoters of company and certain people refrained under Section 29A attempted to take over the company camouflaged as a one-time settlement under Section 12A.\n\nThe above precedents highlight the rising irregularities in functioning of the committee. The primary reason being that the powers and conduct of CoC is not regulated. The various stakeholders tend to lose their confidence in the efficacy of the insolvency process due to mismanagement, delays, unfair advantage to the committee, conflict of interest, etc. Thus, it becomes the fiduciary responsibility of the CoC to make wise decisions in the best interest of the stakeholders.\n\nThe UNCITRAL in its legislative guide on insolvency law observed that the dilation of committee’s powers leads to greater accountability in the insolvency regime. It states that the CoC should act in a bona fide manner and refrain from taking undue advantage of its powers. Further, the guide urged the states to adopt a mechanism of removing or replacing any representative or member of the CoC in case of negligence, incompetency, conflict of interest or fraud. Many countries such as the UK and the USA have a comprehensive set of guidelines to monitor and regulate the conduct of various participants in the insolvency regime. It acts as a guiding light for the stakeholders and reinstates their faith in the resolution process.  Therefore, India should also regulate the conduct of committee of creditors for promoting efficiency and timely completion of CIRP.  \n\nThe Proposed Code of Conduct \n\nAt present, there exists no guidelines or regulations whereby the conduct and working of the CoC is regulated. Moreover, concerns of lack of transparency in the decision-making of the CoC and its unethical conduct were raised by a legion of stakeholders. Thus, to address the above issue and to protect the interest of the varied stakeholders, the Code of Conduct for CoC was proposed by the IBBI. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance in its 32nd report has also stressed upon the need for formulating a code of conduct for CoC.\n\nThe proposed Code of Conduct primarily focuses on maintaining transparency and aims to promote principles of fairness by the CoC in furtherance of discharging various duties and functions as envisaged under the Code. It provides that the CoC must act in a non-partisan manner and should not render decisions under coercion, favour or undue influence. CoC must not make any private gain and shall provide details about a potential conflict of interests when encountered. Further, it states that the CoC shall always act in consonance with the provisions of the Code while discharging its duties and exercising various powers under the Code.\n Impact and Analysis\n\nThe proposed code of conduct envisages basic principles that the CoC ought to follow regardless of them not being explicitly provided under the Code. The proposed principles revolve around the transparency and accountability of CoC in decision making which are integral in building the trust of the stakeholders. Thus, the proposed code of conduct will not result in the fall of the supremacy of the CoC as the powers vested upon the CoC shall remain intact, and merely the modus operandi in the exercise of the powers would be streamlined.\n\nThough the form in which the code of conduct would be implemented is yet to be ascertained, it remains indisputable that the CoC will continue to command greater control in the insolvency regime.\n\nNevertheless, arbitrary and partisan decisions of the CoC in ratifying the resolution plan are generally set aside or revoked by the Adjudicating Authority when the resolution plan is presented before it under Section 31 of the Code for its approval as discussed in the aforesaid case laws. Thus, the Adjudicating Authority ensures that only the resolution plan which safeguards and caters to the interests of the various stakeholders sees the light of day\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its inception in 2016, the Code has been modified frequently to eliminate impediments to smooth functioning of the Code. IBBI has made concerted efforts to strengthen the code by improving the efficacy of CIRP process. The recent proposal of IBBI regarding code of conduct for the CoC is a revolutionary measure to inculcate the fundamental ideals of transparency, fairness and ethical conduct in the insolvency procedure.\n\nThe proposed code of conduct will not compromise the supremacy of the CoC as it shall continue to retain potency even after the enactment of the guidelines. The said code will only make the process more efficient and will reinstate the trust of stakeholders in the CIRP. Nevertheless, the code of conduct is not a panacea to address the loopholes in the existing insolvency regime. Other reforms such as effective strategy to curb non-performing assets, increase in number of NCLT benches to manage the burden of cases, efficient data management, disposal of cases within the prescribed time and other procedural or infrastructural changes will be needed to consolidate the insolvency procedure in order to realize the Sustainable Development Goal 8 i.e., to stimulate economic growth in India.\nCodeCoCCode of ConductCorporate Insolvency Resolution Process\nInsolvency Law\n328 views\n7 likes.

        "title": "Need for Judicial Scrutiny of the Commercial Wisdom of COC",
        "content": "Gaargi Singh\nJun 13, 2022\n7 min read\nNeed for Judicial Scrutiny of the Commercial Wisdom of COC\n[Gaargi is a student at National Law Institute University, Bhopal.]\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has been in effect since 2016 with an aim of reorganizing the company going through insolvency. There was a paradigm shift from the former insolvency laws as IBC was a more creditor friendly legislation. Under the IBC, financial creditors are a part of the committee of creditors (COC) who are the supreme decision making party in a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). It considered the fact that creditors hold the highest stakes in a company which puts them in a better position to adjudge the situation during insolvency process. \n\nThe Supreme Court of India in its judgment of K Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank and Others held that the commercial decision of COC for approval of resolution plan is non-justiciable and hence, is required to be sanctioned by the Adjudicating Authority. The Indian courts have time and again given a wider interpretation to the commercial wisdom of the COC for approval of a resolution plan with a sole restriction that the resolution plan must comply with Section 30(2) of the IBC. The issue arises when the resolution plan fulfils the requirements of Section 30(2) but fails to take into account certain key features of the IBC. \n\nThe article aims to address the issues relating to flexibility given to the COC and the resolution professional (RP) in the name of commercial wisdom while approving a resolution plan since the Adjudicating Authority has no role in evaluation of the commercial decision of the COC. These issues are in the form of approval of unsolicited plan and delay in completion of CIRP. Furthermore, it deals with the question of whether there is a need of code of conduct for the COC by discussing certain guiding principles for creditors and resolution professional around the globe while approving a plan.\n\nWhy there is a need for code of conduct\n\nIBC was consolidated with an objective to provide time-bound insolvency process for maximisation of value of assets of such persons. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 (CIRP Regulations) provides a model timeline for the CIRP. The resolution plan should be approved within 165 days since the commencement of CIRP. \n\nThe timelines are not enforced strictly since resolution plans are being approved by the COC even after the expiry of the deadlines. In Kalpraj Dharamshi and Another v. Kotak Investment Advisors Limited and Another, the Supreme Court of India allowed the acceptance of the resolution plan after the expiry of the deadlines since it was a decision based on the commercial wisdom of the COC. Commercial wisdom of the creditors became an important ground than assessing the qualitative analysis of the resolution plan. Similar view was also observed in Supreme Court of India’s judgment in Ghanashyam Mishra and Sons Private Limited through the Authorized Signatory v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited through the Director and Others. The acceptance of such resolution plan delays the entire CIRP and may raise objections on the arbitrary conduct of the COC.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that delay in CIRP will also lead to reduction in the value of assets of the corporate debtor. Further, increased delay in process causes erosion of stakeholder confidence in process. According to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), of the 4,500 cases that have been admitted, only 14% of the 4,500 CIRP applications have been settled, while the rest are either closed or still under investigation. Of the ongoing cases, 75% have already exceeded the mandatory time limit of 330 days.\n\nAnother issue was raised in Maharashtra Seamless Limited v. Padmanabhan Venkatesh and Others, wherein the COC approved a resolution plan which was valued below the liquidation value by 87.10% of the votes. The Supreme Court of India noted that there are no provisions in the IBC or the regulations which provide that the bid of any resolution applicant has to match the liquidation value arrived at in the manner provided in Clause 35 of the CIRP Regulations. Furthermore, courts cannot intervene on the merits of the resolution plan which is approved based on the commercial wisdom of the COC.\n This wider interpretation of the scope of ‘commercial wisdom’ may be detrimental to the aims and objectives envisioned in the IBC. The court in the Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Others, held that the COC cannot approve a resolution plan that goes against the objective of the code. Approving a resolution plan bid that is less than the liquidation value violates the fundamental principles and objectives of the code. \n\nThe current practice of Indian courts giving primacy to ‘commercial wisdom’ can be seen as a starting point for the unlimited power of COC under the garb of ‘commercial wisdom’. The Supreme Court of India has restricted the scope of judicial review in relation to decisions of the COC to Section 30(2) of the Code. The provisions of Section 30(2) fail to cover an important objective of the code that is timely resolution of the corporate debtor. There is no mention of adhering to the timelines which has led the COC to discuss resolution plans submitted even after the deadlines hence resulting in delayed resolution process as well as haircuts in total dues. The haircuts on the claims have arisen from an average of 55% in previous years to 60% in the financial year 2020-2021.\n\nFurthermore, courts have failed to take note of the reasoning behind the commercial decision of the COC. There are no regulations or guidelines to assess the conduct and the decisions making process of the COC. The IBBI has realised an urgent need for such code of conduct which will define and circumscribe the decisions of the COC since they have larger implications for the efficacy of the IBC.\n\nPractice around the globe           \n                                                                 The COC is the most appropriate body to resolve and revive the corporate debtor thus making it more necessary to further strengthen their framework. While deliberating on the powers of the creditors, it is worthwhile to refer to the position of such creditors under the insolvency scheme in international jurisdiction. In the USA, Section 1129 (a)(7) of the US Bankruptcy Code (US Code) provides that a resolution plan can only be approved if it meets certain ingredients including vote of at least one impaired class where there are classes that are impaired under the plan. The US Code also provides for creation of a group of unsecured creditors for the purpose of representing their interest. \n\nIn the UK, the role of RP is equivalent to that of an Administrator. The Administrator has broad scope of powers and can do anything necessary or expedient for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company, keeping in mind the best interest of the creditors. The British court has provided for a ground to judge the decisions taken by the Administrator. In Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No.2), the court noted that the administrator is to be judged not by the standards of the most meticulous and conscientious member of his profession, but by those of an ordinary, skilled practitioner. In order to challenge the decision of the administrator, one has to prove that the administrator has made an error which a reasonably skilled and careful insolvency practitioner would not have made. \n\nProposed draft and suggestions\n\nIn India, the IBBI proposed the draft Code of Conduct that requires the COC to maintain integrity and objectivity while exercising decisions and refrain from any such action which is detrimental to the objective of the IBC, not engage in any illegal means, cooperate with the resolution professional and so on. The issue with the current draft is that the IBBI has failed to mention how the code will be implemented (i.e., whether it will be incorporated in the statute / regulation or whether it will  merely be in the nature of guidelines having no implication in case of non-compliance). Furthermore, the purpose of bringing such code of conduct in force was to check in the unlimited powers given to the COC in the name of ‘commercial wisdom’. The terms used in the draft code such as “objectivity”, “integrity” are quite broad and do not provide any additional clarity to the current scenario. The draft code has merely provided an additional ground to challenge the resolution plan without providing any concrete substance to grounds of challenge and hence will further delay the process of CIRP.\n\nIt becomes important to suggest changes to the Code of Conduct that further strengthens the framework of insolvency in India. This can be done by restricting the scope of decision making powers of COC within a scheme of guiding principles. IBBI can consider adopting certain guiding principles for the COC which are similar to that of US Code such as Section 1129 (a)(7) or establish certain grounds to judge the commercial decisions of the COC as they have for an Administrator in the UK. Another important principle could be that the commercial decision of the COC should be backed up with fair reasoning. Introducing better due diligence of the resolution applicants will further help in speedy resolution process. Such principles will strengthen the ability of the COC to exercise its commercial wisdom for the benefit of the corporate debtor along with fulfilling the objective of value maximization and balancing the interest of various stakeholders.\n The proposed Code of Conduct is a positive step towards creating an effective regime for implementing insolvency laws in India and ensuring transparency in the entire resolution process. At the same time, a potential drawback is that more lawsuits may arise as a result of the implementation of the Code of Conduct, thereby delaying the resolution process. While regulating the unfettered commercial wisdom of the COC, caution must be exercised to ensure that it is not misused and does not result in a succession of legal proceedings.\nInsolvencyIBCCoCCodeCommercialResolution Plan\nInsolvency Law\n1,283 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Pre-Packaged Insolvency for MSMEs in India: A Shot in the Arm?",
        "content": "Shivam Bhattacharya, Naman Jain\nJun 1, 2022\n5 min read\nPre-Packaged Insolvency for MSMEs in India: A Shot in the Arm?\n[Shivam and Naman are students at Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar.]\n\nThe pre-packaged insolvency resolution process (PPIRP) was brought into effect by way of an ordinance in April 2021 by amending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code), to provide relief to the distressed micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the pandemic. Recognizing the need for reviving the MSME sector, Chapter III-A comprising of Section 54A to 54P was added to the Code to provide an alternative, rapid and cost-effective insolvency mechanism for the revival of these companies, marking a major shift away from the traditional process of insolvency resolution. This speedy resolution under the Code was felt way back in 2015, evident from a report prepared by the Ministry of Finance wherein it was stated that “speed is of the essence for the working of the Bankruptcy Code”.\n\nIn this article, the authors analyse the reasons for the introduction of this resolution process, the objectives it seeks to achieve, its advantages over the traditional insolvency process, and the potential challenges it faces.\n\nWhy was it brought into effect?\n\nWith businesses shut down due to a series of lockdowns, consumer demand being seemingly low and businesses not preferring to go through the conventional insolvency process, the pre-packaging resolution plan has come as a saviour and a tool for revival for the distressed companies. It envisaged the restructuring of liabilities of the company by way of an informal agreement between the corporate debtor, creditors and other stakeholders of the company. Furthermore, the gamut of eligible MSMEs was increased by modifying the criteria for being a MSME, by stating that any business entity having a turnover up to INR 250 crores can claim benefits of the PPIRP process. \n\nBenefits over the traditional insolvency process\n\nThe advantages of PPIRP over the traditional corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be characterised into the following pointers:\n\nEfficiency / value maximization\n\nIn contrast to the time taken by conventional CIRP for resolution, pre-packaging serves as a much faster and more efficient process for debt resolution of a distressed company. It provides that the entire resolution plan has to be submitted before the adjudicating authority (NCLT) within 90 days, and the NCLT has to decide on its approval within 30 days. \n\nThe restructuring procedure is further helped by the provision of stimulus package, which would ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained in the system and adjustment in the asset classification norms by the Central Government. It would thereby lead to a much-needed impetus to the businesses affected by the pandemic, a chance to recover and rejuvenate itself. \n\nDebtor-in-possession model\n\nThe ‘debtor-in-possession’ feature, introduced via Section 54 H(a) of the Code, provides that the effective management of the distressed company would continue to be vested with its board of directors, and the activities of the company would be continued to be controlled by them. They would be responsible for supervising the process of revival of the company. The major benefit arising out of this feature would be that the existing management, being aware of the functioning of the company, would be in a better position to make decisions affecting the future of the company. It would also provide a strong protection against business disruption or derailment of the activities of the company. \n\nBinding nature of the final order\n\nThe statutory protection provided by the NCLT approval would greatly aid in ensuring the finality of the order passed. The conclusive and binding nature of the approval plays a significant role in easing the apprehensions of the stakeholders for the recovery of their due amounts. It would imply that the company would be able to focus solely on its revival, without being bothered about any further disputes or counter-claims, thereby avoiding any court litigation. \n\nKey objectives of this resolution mechanism \n\nThe main objective of this resolution process is to work out a solution in an informal manner, through collaborative efforts between the creditors and the debtors, so that the debt resolution of the company is done in a systematic and efficient manner. The statement of objects of the ordinance provides a key insight, by stating that the main objective is to provide MSMEs with a swift and value maximizing mechanism for the resolution and debt recovery. \n\nMoreover, a clear-cut benefit of this process is that the maximum period involved in the pre-pack resolution process was 120 days, as opposed to the conventional CIRP procedure wherein the time limit was set at 270-days. PPRIP has a clearly delineated timeline for completion - 90 days for the preparation of the resolution plan and 30 days for the approval of the plan by the adjudicating authority. \n\nAnother key feature is the cost-effectiveness of this process. The conventional insolvency process involves a lot of expense for the corporate debtor. These costs have to be managed from the stressed assets of the company, making it an extremely difficult task for them. PPIRP, on the other hand, “allows for a smooth transition of the assets of the company in a cost-effective manner”. \n\nThe mix of formal and informal mechanism in this process provides the management of the company with the requisite flexibility to take decisions without being restrictive in their approach.  The pre-initiation phase where the debtors, creditors and the other stakeholders of the company negotiate amongst themselves for reviving the company is informal in nature, whereas the post-initiation phase which involves submitting the resolution plan and seeking approval from the NCLT is formal in nature. \n\nPotential challenges of this insolvency resolution model\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the success of the pre-packs in India is that it is only applicable to  MSMEs which are registered with the government entity. The apex court had in a recent case of Silpi Industries v Kerala SRTC stated that, for an MSME to claim benefits, it should be registered under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act 2006. However, a staggering 90% of the MSMEs are currently not registered, according to a report, thereby vitiating the entire purpose of providing relief to the stressed MSMEs. \n\nAlso, the provision that the ‘corporate debtor’ would need the approval of 66% of the financial creditors for filing the application for the initiation of the process could prove to be detrimental in case the distressed company is not able to bring on board the required number of creditors.  \n\nFinally, a key point which has a divided opinion within this model has been the over-reliance on the board of directors and thrusting upon them the responsibility of reviving the company. The critics of this are of the opinion that entrusting the same people under whom the assets of the company became stressed, with the responsibility of revival, might not lead to the desired results, and instead, it would have been better if external auditors or experts are appointed.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe ramifications of this new model on the MSME sector in India have been huge, with several of them being saved from becoming insolvent or being burdened with bankruptcy proceedings. With its central theme of providing an efficient, alternative scheme of resolution and providing support to MSMEs during difficult times, the scheme has led to a fresh lease of life in the sector. \n\nAt the same time, this transition from the formal insolvency procedure to a pre-packaging resolution has not been smooth, and there is still a lot of ground to be covered. Though there are still some challenges which need to be addressed as has been stated above, this model has been a major positive step forward in providing for an efficacious, comprehensive and alternative model for insolvency resolution. \nInsolvencyIBCNCLT\nInsolvency Law\n704 views\n6 likes.

        "title": "Collective Dominance Through Tacit Coordination: Application of Game Theory to Indian Antitrust Law",
        "content": "Charu Sharma, Rishabh Periwal\nApr 26, 2022\n9 min read\nCollective Dominance Through Tacit Coordination: Application of Game Theory to Indian Antitrust Law\n[Charu and Rishabh are students at National Law University, Jodhpur. The following post is one of the winning entries in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nSection 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) has often been criticised for not penalising collective dominance. While the legislation clearly penalises abuse of dominant position by a single entity, it does not recognise the concept of collective dominance and the same has sparked a legal debate as to whether or not India should recognise and then, penalise abuse of collective dominance. \n\nWhile the criticism regarding the Indian legal position on collective dominance had been mounting up, the 2019 Report of the Review Committee on Competition Law (Report) addressed doubts regarding whether or not collective dominance can be recognised in India. It stated that Section 4 does not recognise the concept of collective dominance. However, at the root of it, the concept of collective dominance seeks to attack anti-competitive trade agreements and the same is sufficiently covered by Section 3 of the Act. The committee, therefore, concluded that there was no gap in the law and no need to exclusively recognise the concept of collective dominance. \n\nIn light of the above-mentioned, the authors partly agree with the Report. The issue of collective dominance is unavoidable in an oligopoly and the same has been explained through the application of game theory. However, even though Section 3 of the Act seems sufficient to deal with the issue of abuse of collective dominance, it falls short in recognising the signs of collective dominance through tacit coordination due to a lack of uniform standards for identifying tacit coordination, a key part of abuse of collective dominance. \n\nWhat is Collective Dominance?\n\nIf one were to view an oligopolistic market as a game, the enterprises engaged in the market would be the players who seek to obtain the winning prize of the game, which are maximum possible profits. In an oligopoly, the quantity that each firm will be able to sell of a non-differentiated product depends heavily on the difference in the selling price of the products. Consider the following example of a market that has two firms that are considering how to determine the price of their products.\n\n\nIn the above matrix, both the firms are able to get a profit of ₹50 if they sell their products for ₹5. If Firm I were to sell its product at ₹5 while Firm II sells its product at ₹10, Firm I will be able to derive a profit of ₹100 while Firm II derives a profit of only ₹25 and vice versa. If both firms sell their product at ₹10, then they both will be able to derive a profit of ₹75. When these firms analyse the strategies available to them, they shall come to the conclusion that the best strategy possible for them is to sell their product at ₹5. \n\nHowever, the problem arises in an oligopoly when the collectively dominant firms are tacitly coordinating and thus are aware that even if they increase their price to ₹10, the firm that it is competing with will also increase their price to ₹10. This limits competition in the industry and results in a situation where the collectively dominant firms start abusing their dominant position. \n\nLegal Recognition \n\nThe United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) recognise the issue of collective dominance. Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union emulates the provision against abuse of collective dominance. It describes abuse of dominant position such as to include abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market. \n\nThe EU General Court, in the case of Irish Sugar plc v. Commission, further clarified the meaning of collective dominance: \n“A joint dominant position consists in a number of undertakings being able together, in particular because of factors giving rise to a connection between them, to adopt a common policy on the market and act to a considerable extend independently of their competitors, their consumers, and ultimately consumers.”\nWhile the English law also states that two companies can have ‘collective dominance’ if they ‘are linked in such a way that they adopt a common policy on the market’, there have not been any cases wherein the concept of collective dominance had been established. Section 47 of the Singapore Competition Act also states that ‘any conduct on the part of one or more undertakings which amounts to the abuse of a dominant position in any market in Singapore is prohibited’. However, in Singapore too, there have not been any cases where the concept of collective dominance was used. \n\nThe main reason that critics employ to say that Indian law does not recognise collective dominance is the wording of Section 4. It clearly states “…position of strength enjoyed by an enterprise”. The expression “enterprise” has been defined in Section 2(h). It means either a person (including a company) or a department of the government. When it was suggested in 2012 by way of a bill that the phrase “jointly or singly” should be included in Section 4, the same was rejected by the legislature. \n\nIs There Room for Recognising Collective Dominance in Indian Law?\n\nIt must be noted that Section 3 of the Act prohibits an enterprise or a person or any association of enterprises or persons from entering into anti-competitive agreements. It covers agreements in respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of services which cause or are likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition within India. The courts have clarified at multiple instances that such an agreement may be formal or informal. \nFor instance, the Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) in International Cylinder (P) Limited v. Competition Commission of India (CCI) recognised and penalised an anti-competitive concerted agreement inferred from the conduct of the parties. This lends support to the Report’s assertion that Indian competition law has enough legal provisions to counter collective dominance by recognition of anti-competitive trade agreements, executed both overtly and covertly. While it is true that Section 3 and its jurisprudence is sufficient in recognising abuse of collective dominance through overt anti-competitive trade agreements, the same is not true for recognition of abuse of collective dominance through tacit coordination in an oligopoly.\n\nDefining Tacit Coordination \n\nTacit coordination or tacit collusion refers to an oligopolistic market phenomenon where leading firms take advantage of certain features of a market and coordinate their behaviour on prices, output, etc., by taking into account their competitors’ strategies and likely reactions without getting into an overt agreement. \n\nThere need not be any communication between the parties for them to collude tacitly. It is referred to as tacit collusion only because the consequences may well resemble those of explicit collusion or even of an official cartel. \n\nStandard for tacit coordination in India\n\nAs stated before, Section 3 allows for the penalisation of tacit collusion. However, the standards to determine whether collusion has taken place or not have not been uniform across case laws.\n In Tyre Dealers Federation v. Tyre manufacturers, the CCI recognised the possibility of collusion in an oligopolistic market but with fair caution that such parallelism can only be liable for penalisation when it is rational and agreed upon and not when it is a result of market practices. It stated:\n“Thus, high concentration may provide a structural reasoning for collusive action resulting in parallelism (price or output), yet it is very important to differentiate between ‘rational’ conscious parallelism arising out of the interdependence of the firms' strategic choices and parallelism stemming from purely concerted action. Thus, inferring of cartels would require further evidences. Economic theory has demonstrated convincingly that ‘conscious parallelism’, is not uncommon in homogeneous oligopolistic markets. Competing firms are bound to be conscious of one another's activities in all phases, including marketing and pricing. Aware of such outcomes especially where there is little real difference in product the CCI is of the opinion that it is quite probable that in many such instances, conscious parallelism may be dictated solely by economic necessity. Avoidance of price wars is a common instance where this takes place.”\nWhile this distinction between conscious parallelism and parallelism as a result of market practices is an important observation to delineate collusion from business sensibility, the case did not provide a set criterion for recognising tacit collusion.  \n\nThen, in In Re: Suo motu case (LPG Cylinder case) against LPG cylinder manufacturers, the CCI laid down that in order to prove an ‘agreement’ through circumstantial evidence, the evidence must tend to “exclude the possibility of independent action”. While elaborating on what can constitute the circumstantial evidence to prove parallelism, the CCI, in the same case, held that meetings of the firms and price communications constitute evidence of an agreement. However, in a similar case in the same industry (In Re: Alleged cartelisation in supply of LPG Cylinders procured through tenders by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL)), the CCI held that circumstantial evidence, in absence of any corroboration by an independent witness is not admissible as evidence and conclusions cannot be based on such uncorroborated circumstantial evidence alone.\n\nThen, in the latest case of Shikha Roy v. Jet Airways, the CCI held that the existence of an anti-competitive practice or agreement must be inferred from a number of coincidences and indicia which, taken together, may, in the absence of any other plausible explanation, constitute evidence of the existence of an agreement. \n\nWhat is evident from the trends of these cases is that while the Indian jurisprudence recognises tacit collusion and has diligently delineated between rational parallelism and parallelism as a result of market strategy, it has not emphasised on how such collusion can be identified. There is no set standard for the determination of when market strategy crosses into the area of collusion. While some judgements depend on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for evidence of cartelisation, some judgements seek support from the EU’s law. Some judgements contest the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence while some say that when circumstantial evidence is available and any other inference is not logically probable, the former is enough to prove collusion. \n\nConclusion\n\nIt is true that collective dominance does not need an exclusive legal provision to identify its abuse. However, as has been proven above, the abuse of collective dominance is always possible in an oligopoly and since the same is done through anti-competitive trade agreements, Indian law with the help of Section 3 is sufficient enough to counter it. However, when the same abuse occurs through tacit coordination, Indian law falls short in identifying signs of tacit coordination. The same circumstantial evidence that leads to liability under Section 3 in one case is deemed insufficient in another. \n\nThe Supreme Court tried to address the issue in the case of Rajasthan Cylinders & Containers Ltd. v. Union of India, wherein it read Section 3 and Section 9 of the Act in conjunction and held that the necessary ingredients of collusion are: (a) agreement between the parties; (b) these parties are engaged in identical or similar production or trading of goods or provisions of services; and (c) the agreement has the effect of eliminating or reducing competition of bids or adversely affect or manipulating the process for bidding. It relied upon the guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the functioning of the EU to horizontal cooperation agreements which says that evidence of communication between parties like emails should be looked into to establish tacit coordination.\n\nWhile this serves to identify the possible consequences of tacit coordination to establish it, it still does not provide the rationale as to how parallelism occurring due to market forces can be differentiated from collusion induced parallelism. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify signs of tacit collusion for uniform applicability of law. For setting these standards, laws in other jurisdictions can be looked at. \n\nThe EU General Court laid down the identification factors for recognising collective dominance in Irish Sugar. It stated that two entities may still hold a joint dominant position, even if they are in fact independent from each other in economic terms. Such dominant position was ultimately found in the case where there were links making it possible for them to successfully adopt a common market policy. The links in question were that one of the firms held shares in the other firm’s parent company, and also had board members in both the parent company its subsidiary. It is apparent that such capacity made it possible for the undertakings to adopt a similar conduct on the market. \n\nFurther, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore Guidelines specifically state that a collective dominant position may be held when two or more legally independent undertakings, from an economic point of view, present themselves or act together on a particular market as a collective entity. Essentially, undertakings holding a collective dominant position are able to adopt a common policy on the market and, to a considerable extent, act independently of their competitors, customers and consumers. The guidelines also advise look at whether the entities are collectively dominant in other geographical markets except Singapore. \n\nHence, to counter the lack of uniformity, India needs to develop a set of guidelines mentioning the relevant factors that could lead to tacit collusion by two or more dominant entities.\nCompetitionCompetition ActCCICollective Dominance\nCompetition Law\n657 views\n10 likes.

        "title": "Examining Retrospectivity and Discretionary Relief of Specific Performance Post-2018 Amendment",
        "content": "Payal Dubey, Shivansh Vishwakarma\nApr 19, 2022\n9 min read\nExamining Retrospectivity and Discretionary Relief of Specific Performance Post-2018 Amendment\n[Payal and Shivansh are students at National Law Institute University, Bhopal. The following post is one of the winning entries in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nThe first-ever law of specific relief codified in India was the Specific Relief Act 1887. The Ninth Law Commission Report recommended certain changes to this enactment; which then ultimately led to the passing of the Specific Relief Act 1963 (Act). Slowly and steadily as the times demanded, the Act underwent several amendments in the years 1964 and 1974. The latest amendment to this Act was made in 2018 after the recommendations of an Expert Committee constituted for this purpose. \n\nThe Specific Relief (Amendment) Act 2018 (Amendment Act) brought about various changes to the Act. Some of the major changes included removal of discretion of the courts while granting the relief of specific performance, no injunction against infrastructure projects, delimiting timeline for the disposal of the case, seeking expert opinion, substituted performance of contract, addition of limited liability partnership within the ambit of parties who can seek specific performance, and contracts that cannot be specifically enforced.\n\nWith all these amendments and changes in place, there are some changes which are in debate for quite a while now. These include the retrospective application of the Amendment Act and the discretionary power of the court to render the specific performance relief. In this article, the authors have tried to make a detailed analysis of these issues along with highlighting the latest developments in these issues. \n\nRetrospective Application of the Amendment Act\n\nA question of importance that has emerged since the inception of the Amendment Act relates to the nature of the Amendment, i.e., is it retrospective or prospective?\n\nThe amendments that have been brought through this Act align with the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts. This has been done in a bid to improve the enforceability of contracts. The amendments so introduced are not procedural, but substantive in nature. For instance, the remedy for specific performance can now be claimed as a matter of right and is no longer a relief at the discretion of the courts. \n\nIt is trite law that if the amendment is substantive in nature or if it affects the vested rights of parties, then it will have a prospective effect but if it is procedural in nature, i.e., if the amendment changes jurisdiction, affects evidence, pleadings, or practice only, then it can have a retrospective effect too. \n\nIt has also been held by the Supreme Court in the case of K.C. Arora v. State of Haryana that if the statute does not specifically provide for the retrospective application, then the statute will be said to have prospective effect only.\n\nThe Amendment Act did not specifically mention whether it will have a retrospective effect or not. This sparked a debate on the nature of the amendment that has not reached its finality to date. There are various scholars and jurists that weigh their claim in favour of the prospective effect of the amendment while there are many who have reasoned that the amendment should have a retrospective effect.\n\nVarious arguments in support of the prospective application have been brought to the fore. These are:\nThe amendment tries to bring substantive change in law when it states that the remedy of specific performance can now be claimed as a matter of right. More so, the amendment does not confine itself to be only declaratory or clarificatory in nature.\nSection 6(b) of the General Clauses Act 1897 (General Clauses Act) provides that the repeal of any enactment shall not affect the previous operation of such enactment so repealed      unless a different intention appears, and Section 6 (c) of the General Clauses Act provides that the repeal of any enactment shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability accrued under the previous enactment. Since the Amendment Act has substituted provisions of the Act and it does not clearly mention as to whether or not these amendments shall have      retrospective effect, therefore the amendment cannot affect the operation of the repealed provisions, nor it can affect any rights, liabilities, obligations, or privileges accrued under the repealed provisions. This would mean that the amendment shall have prospective effect only.\nOn the other hand, there are also various arguments in favour of retrospective application of the Amendment Act. These are:\nIn the case of Gottumukkala Venkata Krishamraju v. Union of India, the Supreme Court tried to distinguish between ‘amendment’ and ‘substitution’ and stated that that the term ‘substitution’      means replacement or obliteration of the existing provision while making new provision operative, which enables the retrospective application of the amendment. Since the Amendment Act substitutes certain provisions of the Act, therefore it has to be retrospective in nature.\nIn the case of B. Santoshamma v. D. Sarala (B. Santoshamma), the Supreme Court held that courts are now supposed to grant the relief of specific performance keeping in mind only the conditions mentioned under Section 11 (2), Section 14, and Section 16 of the Act and hence the relief of specific performance is no longer discretionary. This observation here is pertinent because the suit for specific performance, in this case, was filed before the Amendment Act came into force; despite which, specific performance was awarded.\nThe Calcutta High Court in the case of The Church of North India v. Rev. Ashok Bisvas, when posed with the question of the applicability of the amended Section 14 to a case pending before it even prior to the Amendment Act coming into force, stated that the way in which Section 14 has been worded would mean that the amendment is retrospective in application since the phrase used in the concerned Section is “the following contracts cannot be specifically enforced…” and not a non-obstante clause like, “no suit can be filed for specific performance of the following contracts…”.\nSince we do not have any provision in the amendment that could clearly tell us the nature of the amendment, we have no other option but to go by the word of the Judiciary, which in the present scenario seems to be in favour of the retrospective application of the amendment. Moreover, recently in the case of Sughar Singh v. Hari Singh (Sughar Singh), the Supreme Court has again stated that though the amendment is not applicable retrospectively, it can be a guide to the courts while they grant the relief of specific performance.\n\nIn light of all the observations made hereinabove, it can be stated that courts have more often than not favoured the retrospective application of the amendment. Additionally, since the Supreme Court has made regular references to the positions of law pre and post-Amendment Act and explained its significance while granting the relief of specific performance in recent judgements, it would be safe to say that the Supreme Court is tilted in favour of the retrospective application of the amendment.\n\nTo date, the legislature has not made an attempt to clear the air regarding the retrospective application of the amendment and there still remains a doubt over the same. It has been more than three years since the Amendment Act was brought into force but still there is no clarity with respect to this issue. Both the schools of thought have justified their stance by bringing to their support one or the other legal principles but courts have seemed to favour retrospective application of the amendment. This approach of the courts has also shown that they have tried their best to make the provisions of the amended Act work even in pending cases. As this seems to give justice to one party and injustice to the other, we need a legislative effort on this front to solve this issue. Not to say that the Judiciary cannot step in to solve this issue, but to settle its roots, a decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court is required. Given the pendency of the cases and the workload of the Supreme Court, it is not easy for the apex court to arrive at a decision sooner than the legislature or the executive. \n\nRelief of Specific Performance: Mandatory or Discretionary\n\nAnother point of discussion after the Amendment Act has been around the discretionary power of the court to grant relief of specific performance to the plaintiff. Prior to the amendment, compensation was the rule and specific performance, an exception; however, with the amendment, the legislature seems to have taken a diagonal shift. The Expert Committee constituted in 2016 to revise and review the Act suggested that the specific performance should become a routine and should be denied only in limited cases which should be exhaustively laid down in the Act. In their opinion, the discretion has created an uncertainty on when the specific performance relief would be granted. Moreover, they observed that a legal system preferring compensatory relief over performance of the contract gives all the more reason to the promisor to not perform the contract if it is not their favour. Therefore, they concluded that if the specific performance becomes a statutory relief, it would encourage performance and discourage breach and would change contractual behaviour on the whole.\n\nAs a result of the Report of the Expert Committee, unamended Section 20 which laid down the directions for the court to exercise discretion while granting the relief of specific performance has been substituted with the provision providing for substituted performance of contract post amendment. Simultaneously, amended Section 10 provides that the specific performance of a contract shall be enforced by the court subject to Section 11 (2), Section 14, and Section 16 of the Act. The words that need attention here are ‘shall’ and ‘subject to’.\n\nThe Supreme Court in the case of B. Santoshamma had for the first time clarified that after the amendment, the remedy of specific performance no longer remains a discretionary relief. It noted that the earlier phrase of Section 10 has been replaced and the use of the word ‘shall’ in the current provision, lucidly gives the provision a mandatory character. Further clarification was provided by a very recent Supreme Court judgement in the case of Sughar Singh, where the apex court upheld the findings of B. Santoshamma. The Division Bench also added that if the execution of the contract, partial payment of the plaintiff's consideration, and willingness is proven in cases that date back to prior to the Amendment Act, then the court should go with the decision that favours the plaintiff for specific enforcement.\n\nIn the same vein, a very relevant remark was made by Justice Bhattacharya in the case of The All India Tea and Trading Company Limited v. Loobah Company Limited. The Calcutta High Court, agreeing with the non-discretionary nature of the relief, gave a rather branched interpretation to the amended Section 10. It opined that Section 11(2), Section 14, and Section 16 have diluted the mandatory nature of the provision and hence the relief is not absolute. The just remedy would be possible only when the significance of the key phrase ‘shall be enforced’ is understood in consonance with other amendments and the same is harmoniously read with the conditions or exceptions laid down in Section 11(2), Section 14, and Section 16 of the Act.\n\nJustice Bhattacharya’s remark detangles the whole matter and makes it clear that discretion still exists in the hands of the courts. However, the way of exercising it needs to be changed after the amendment. Therefore, now we shall analyse how the discretion is to be exercised now as compared to the pre-amendment times.\n\nIn the case of Kamal Kumar v. Premlata Joshi, the Supreme Court had laid down the five material questions which need to be asked while granting the relief of specific performance to the plaintiff; however, the said judgement did not take into consideration the newly passed Amendment Act. The questions are: \nWhether there exists a valid and concluded contract between the parties?\nWhether the plaintiff has been ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and whether he      is still ready and willing to perform his part of the contract?\nWhether the plaintiff has already performed his part of the contract and if so, to what extent and in what manner he has performed and whether such performance was in conformity with the terms of the contract?\nWhether it will be equitable to grant the relief of specific performance or will it cause any kind of hardship to the defendant and if so, how and in what manner and to what extent should such relief be granted to the plaintiff?\nWhether the plaintiff is entitled to any alternative relief, such as refund of earnest money      deposit, etc.?\nThese questions were reflections of the provisions already present in the unamended Act. With the Amendment Act, only the fourth question needs to be modified a little to give due regard to the letter and intent of the Amendment. Other principles are in conformity with the amended provisions. It must be modified to — whether it will be equitable to not grant the relief of specific performance or will it cause any kind of hardship to the plaintiff and if so, how and in what manner and to what extent should such relief be not granted against the defendant (which requires the defendant to justify the refusal)?\n\nThe modifications are needed to preserve the adequacy of the questions and keep them relevant. As explained earlier, the discretionary power of the courts has been reduced to an extent but they have not been completely abdicated from their responsibility to employ principles of equity, justice and good conscience while providing relief. Hence, these guiding principles can provide requisite aid to the courts to make decisions. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe substantive changes that have been brought about by the Amendment Act were much needed looking at the evolving industry size and operations and consequently, burgeoning rate of contractual relations entered into each day. \n\nHowever, it is saddening that the Amendment Act created issues in terms of its application due to ambiguous drafting of the provisions. To make it functional, Judiciary has been following the unsaid rule of retrospective application but no attempts are being made to cure the disease of uncertainty once and for all. The most expeditious and reliable method is clarification from the legislature or interference by the executive to clear the mist.\n\nSimilarly for the exercise of discretion, as changing times bring its own challenges, different from the earlier ones, it is to be seen whether the legislature was truly successful in laying down the exhaustive guidelines vis-à-vis granting of relief of specific performance or the judicial interpretations and silent diversions will continue to lead the way.\nAmendmentSpecific Relief\nDispute Resolution\n1,167 views\n6 likes.

        "content": "Tanmay Gupta, Shobhit Shukla\nApr 16, 2022\n10 min read\nTraversing the Highs and Lows of Judicial Intervention in Arbitration\n[Tanmay is a student at NALSAR University of Law, and Shobhit is a student at Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai. The following post is one of the winning entries in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nWith the recent verdicts in Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Delhi Airport), Gemini Bay Transcription v. Integrated Sales Service (Gemini Bay) and The Project Director NHAI v. M. Hakeem & Another (NHAI), the growing inclination of the judiciary towards minimizing its intervention with arbitral awards within the statutory scheme of Sections 34 and 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (A&C Act) has become quite discernible. While the first two acknowledged the limited scope of the public policy grounds provided under Sections 34 and 48 with regard to the enforcement of domestic and foreign arbitral awards respectively, the last one affirms that due restraint must be exercised by courts in choosing to modify arbitral awards in keeping with the legislative intention. \n\nAll of these decisions from 2021 have contributed towards settling some contentious issues within the realm of Section 34 with a long history of conflicting pronouncements. Hence, it is imperative to trace the origin of the odyssey that the judiciary had embarked upon to finally reach this destination and examine the interpretive struggles that it had to face on its way.\n\nIt is also crucial to note that even though the aforementioned judgments may indicate an increasingly noticeable tendency of the judiciary to interfere less with arbitral awards, there are still some aspects of the arbitral process in which judicial intervention can be minimized. Hence, this article seeks to not only appreciate the notable strides made by the judiciary in its endeavour of achieving minimal interference in arbitration matters but also highlight the considerable scope for improvement in this regard for the judiciary by discussing some case laws related to such aspects.\n\nTracing the Gradual Limitation of the Scope of Public Policy \n\nPrior to the enactment of the A&C Act, in Renusagar Power Electric Company Limited v. General Electric Company (Renusagar), the Apex Court had the chance to elucidate India's conception of public policy, as used in Section 7 of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Execution) Act of 1961, against the backdrop of a foreign-seated arbitration. The court noted in its opinion that the expression could be subjected to both restrictive and expansive interpretations. Thus, a distinction between how public policy is applied in the national and foreign domains was delineated. In view of considerations pertaining to private international law and the pro-enforcement inclination inherent in 1958 New York Convention, the court stated that India's public policy should be considered narrowly. Its ruling in this case was widely regarded as a foundational authority on the norm that reconsideration of an arbitral award on merits cannot be undertaken during the enforcement stage. It was quite evident that the pro-arbitration bias globally prevalent at the time was duly recognized by the court in its verdict.\n\nLater, as the A&C Act came into being in 1996, clouds of incertitude loomed over Renusagar’s precedential utility it was approved by a court under the reformed arbitration framework. In ONGC v. Saw Pipes Limited (ONGC), the Supreme Court was tasked with clearing these clouds when it had to outline the parameters of public policy with regard to the setting aside of a domestic arbitral award under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the A&C Act. Specifically, it was compelled to determine if it had the jurisdiction to set aside an award that may be deemed as ‘patently illegal’ or reconsider an award on its merits. The ruling in ONGC was antithetical to the one in Renusagar. The court decided that because it was the A&C Act itself that created an arbitral tribunal, it would be necessary for the court to interfere if the arbitral tribunal breached the A&C Act's requirements. The court incorrectly confused jurisdictional and procedural errors, holding that the arbitral tribunal's infringements of the A&C Act constituted jurisdictional violations. To further bolster ONGC's precedential significance, the court added the issue of \"patent illegality\" to the list of grounds established by the court in the Renusagar case, thus opening the floodgates for Section 34(2) lawsuits.\n\nIn ONGC v. Western Geco International Limited (Western Geco), the court was faced with an appeal an international commercial arbitration having a seat in India. The court not only conformed to the verdict in ONGC but also allowed the reassessment of an award on its merits on the grounds of safeguarding the “fundamental policy of Indian law,” which goes against the spirit of Renusagar. Moreover, the court failed to recognize that the public policy test is to be employed to determine whether the award’s enforcement would result in a breach of public policy, and not to determine the arbitral award’s merits. Consequently, the court had irrevocably tied India's public policy with the merits of an arbitral award without realizing its consequences. Furthermore, the court in Renusagar had clarified that an award cannot be set aside by a court merely on account of a disagreement with the arbitrator’s legal or factual rationale. Lastly, the court’s discussion of the “fundamental policy of Indian law” has resulted in a repetition of the grounds already listed in Section 34(2)(a). As a result, the procedural errors covered by Section 34(2)(a) are now covered by Section 34(2)(b)(ii) as well, which encompasses principles of natural justice as a ground. This has allowed obstinate parties to wreak havoc by challenging arbitral rulings through a backdoor.\n\nDespite the concept of stare decisis and the consequence burden of the precedents set in Western Geco and ONGC, the court attempted to alleviate the detrimental consequences of these previous rulings. Despite having to concede to ONGC that violating the contract's terms would amount to “patent illegality,” the court in Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (Associate Builders) has tactfully relied on the dictums of McDermott International v. Burn Standard Company Limited (McDermott International) and Rashtriya Ispat v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran to give primacy to the arbitrator's findings concerning contract interpretation. The court further stated that when a court applies the public policy test to an arbitral award, it does not serve as a court of appeal, and, as a result, factual mistakes cannot be addressed, which a notable shift from the approach taken in ONGC and Western Geco. Despite the precedential burden, the decision in Associate Builders may be regarded as a landmark decision that signalled the beginning of a more pro-arbitration approach to preserving arbitral verdicts.\n\nIn Ssangyong Engg. and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority of India (Ssangyong Engg.), the Supreme Court made extensive observations on the situation following the 2015 amendment to the A&C Act. It ruled that only arbitral rulings that shock the court's conscience may be considered under the head of ‘justice or morality’. The court also stated that “patent illegality” must clearly appear on face of the award, implying that such an illegality goes to the heart of the matter but excludes an erroneous application of law by the tribunal or a reappreciation of evidence as an appellate court. The court in Ssangyong Engg. appropriately implemented the legislative intent by correcting the flaws in its previous decisions, thereby rectifying the flaws created by Saw Pipes and restoring Renusagar.\n\nThe latest reiteration of the stance taken by the Supreme Court in Ssangyong Engg. comes in Delhi Airport wherein it was held that not every alternative interpretation embraced by an arbitral tribunal or ostensibly erroneous application of law can be included under the umbrella of ‘patent illegality’ to set aside the award.\n\nWhile articulating its stance on the extent of public policy under Section 48 of the A&C Act in Phulchand Exports Limited v. O.O.O. Patriot, the court adopted a fairly arbitrary approach and deviated from the widely acknowledged norm that the public policy ground should be applied narrowly to foreign awards. It ruled that the scope of public policy grounds under both Sections 34 and 48 is the same, despite the fact that it was clearly defiant of the principle of comity of nations and the worldwide pro-enforcement prejudice. However, it was later overruled in Shri Lal Mahal Limited v. Progetto Grano Spa (Shri Lal Mahal) wherein the court affirmed that “patent illegality” would not constitute a component of the public policy grounds stated under Section 48. This was also acknowledged by the court very recently in Gemini Bay.\n\nReduced Propensity to Modify Arbitral Awards\n\nAnother notable development within the statutory scheme under Section 34 emanated from the Supreme Court’s verdict in NHAI. Herein, the Supreme Court cited many decisions such as Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited v. Navigant Technologies Private Limited, Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damanito and McDermott International to support its conclusion that Section 34 only provides a constricted right with limited remedies. Specifically, these include the opportunity to have either the case returned to the arbitral tribunal or the award set aside. The court established that Section 34 is not an appellate provision, and so does not necessitate a reconsideration of the case’s merits. The court emphasized upon the significance of considering the legislative intention to state that the Parliament’s intention with regard to the provision at hand is fairly lucid, which is to safeguard the arbitral awards from unwarranted judicial intervention so that the status of arbitration as an effective and expedient alternative remedy is maintained. In spite of the ostensibly progressive attitude of the court in NHAI in terms of promoting minimal judicial intervention with arbitral awards, there still subsists some scope for concern in this regard. In its judgment, the court had also taken note of some of its previous decisions such as Hindustan Zinc Limited v. Friends Coal Carbonisation, Gautam Constructions and Fisheries Limited v. National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development and Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Limited v. G. Harischandra Reddy. In all these judgments, it had engaged in the modification of the award by altering either the sum granted by the arbitral tribunal or the interest, thus also prompting the High Courts to normalize varying, correcting or modifying arbitral awards. While acknowledging these previous pronouncements, the court defended them by citing the authority bestowed upon it by Article 142 of the Constitution “to do complete justice between the parties”. This indicates that there may be instances, although limited, wherein it presses into service this authority to modify arbitral awards, and hence, leaves room for judicial interference.\n\nSubsisting Scope for Unwarranted Stay on Arbitral Awards\n\nPreviously, filing an application under Section 34 of the A&C Act for the setting aside of an arbitral award would result in an automatic stay, and this provision was condemned by the Apex Court in National Aluminum Company Limited v. Pressteel & Fabrications Limited for not leaving with it any discretion to place the parties on terms.\n\nIn 2015, the automatic stay of awards was abolished by an amendment that entirely supplanted Section 36 of the A&C Act. The reason behind this abolition was that dealing with cases involving the setting aside of arbitral awards had become inordinately time-consuming for the courts, and rendering the entire mechanism inefficient. As a consequence of the amendment to Section 36, complemented by the BCCI v. Kochi Cricket (Private) Limited (BCCI) verdict stating the amendment would apply retrospectively to all setting aside applications as well, it seemed the idea of automatic stay of arbitral awards was abrogated for good.\n\nHowever, through an amendment to the A&C Act in 2019, Section 87 was inserted. This provision indicated that the 2015 amendment is to be applied prospectively, thus implying that unconditional stay on arbitral awards would still apply to arbitration proceedings that were initiated prior to 23 October 2015. This, in effect, overturned the verdict in BCCI.\n\nSubsequently, in the case of Hindustan Construction Company v. Union of India, the Supreme Court expressed its dissatisfaction with the 2019 amendment’s upshot of disregarding the legislative intention to minimize excessive deferrals in the enjoyment of the benefits that the award debtor is entitled to by virtue of the award. Hence, in this case, the court pronounced Section 87 as unconstitutional on the grounds of manifest arbitrariness under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. Nevertheless, the impact of this judgment was negated by an ordinance amendment to the A&C Act promulgated in 2020, which was later approved by way of the 2021 amendment to the A&C Act. It defies the growing resistance to unconditional stay on arbitral awards by stating that the same can be granted when a prima facie case for the arbitration agreement or contract, which constituted the basis of the award, or the making of the award being induced by corruption or fraud can be made.\n\nScope for Intervention under the garb of Judicial Scrutiny under Section 11\n\nFor the past few years, the extent of judicial examination or inspection under Section 11 of the A&C Act has been a particularly contentious issue. SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering was one of the first important cases addressing the assessment of this power's ambit. Herein, the Supreme Court had arrived at the conclusion that that this function was essentially a judicial one, and not merely administrative. Subsequently, the scope of judicial inquiry was re-evaluated through the 2015 Amendment to the A&C Act, which stated that the same was limited to establishing the “existence of the arbitration agreement.”\n\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court's recent decision in DLF v. Rajapura has enlarged the purview of judicial scrutiny in arbitration matters. As per the ruling, the court's function has evolved from just finding the ‘existence of the dispute’ to confirming that there exists a discernible connection between the parties' dispute and their arbitration agreement. If the parties fail to demonstrate this nexus, the courts now have the right to turn down the application for arbitration, a power that was previously reserved exclusively for arbitral tribunals.\n\nAlthough the broadened extent of judicial examination has been applauded by some, it has been highlighted by several sceptics that allowing courts to decide whether or not an arbitration agreement is valid would take a long time and cause unwarranted inconveniences in the process of resolution of the dispute. Furthermore, as has always been the case, in the event of a conflict, the court’s judgement will take precedence over the tribunal's. As a result, the arbitral tribunal's authority to resolve the issues before it might be affected adversely.\n\nTherefore, the precedent set in this case is clearly at variance with the concept of ‘Kompetenz-Kompetenz,’ and aggravates the scope for excessive judicial intervention in arbitration matters.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter examining the augmentation and restriction of the scope of “public policy of India\" embodied in Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the A&C Act from the Renusagar judgment in 1994 to the Delhi Airport judgment in 2021, there appears to be a long-drawn battle finally reaching its conclusion. Despite the far-reaching consequences of McDermott International, Shri Lal Mahal, Associate Builders, Ssangyong Engg. and Delhi Airport decisions, there appears to be an opportunity for mischief that might harm India's aspirations to become a pro-arbitration regime. Although the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in Renusagar was of considerable utility in its endeavour of minimizing judicial interference, it ended up falling victim only to the “unruly horse.” Although the Supreme Court restored the status of Renusagar in Ssangyong Engg., a more authoritative ruling by it is required, one that strictly limits the judiciary’s powers, preventing it from reading more profound into the term “public policy of India” and thus, emerging victorious in its battle against the “unruly horse.”\n\nIn addition to this, the subsisting issues pertaining to the modification of arbitral awards, unconditional stay of arbitral awards and greater scope for judicial scrutiny under Section 11 must also be given higher consideration since they may pose a significant impediment in making India a favoured arbitration centre.\n\nThe government must establish a strategy that encourages foreign corporations to invest in India. In addition, in order for India to realize its goal of becoming a global arbitration hub, the courts must adopt a pro-arbitration system, which calls for minimal participation in the implementation of international arbitral awards, as envisioned in the Vedanta decision.\nParty AutonomyArbitrationJudicial Intervention\nDispute Resolution\n433 views\n7 likes.

        "content": "Arun Raghuram Mahapatra, Akshat Verma\nApr 15, 2022\n4 min read\nCauses of Inordinate Delays in the IBC and the Elixir to Cure Them - Part II\n[Akshat and Arun are students at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Patiala, Punjab.]\n\nThis is the second part of the two-part blog on the Causes of Inordinate Delays in the IBC and the Elixir to Cure Them (see Part - I here). This part discusses the situation concerning judicial delays pertaining to NCLT and NCLAT benches. \n\nNCLT and NCLAT Benches: The Focal Point of Judicial Delays\n\nNCLT is the only adjudicating authority under the IBC framework, for corporate persons. Once an application under IBC has been acknowledged by the NCLT, then the aggrieved party, as per the order of NCLT, can prefer an appeal before the NCLAT. A major chunk of the existing literature suggests that the slow judicial process acts as a hindrance to the increasing non-performing loans (NPLs). Court involvement is non-negotiable for guaranteeing the rights of various parties involved and can proliferate ex-post efficiency by acting as a coordination tool.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for the delay in the time-bound process of insolvency is the lack of operational benches (both NCLT and NCLAT) and the vacancy in terms of members present. The SC, in a petition filed by the NCLT and the Appellate Tribunal Bar Association, observed that only 39 member spots were filled up at present against the sanctioned strength of 63. The SC also observed that the depletion in the number of members would adversely affect the smooth functioning of the Tribunals.\n Furthermore, another problem plaguing the operation of NCLTs is the broad array of cases these tribunals hear apart from the petitions under the IBC. Cases under the Companies Act 2013 also fall under the jurisdiction of NCLT, and can be appealed to the NCLAT in case of a grievance. Apart from this, NCLAT also has the exclusive jurisdiction as an appellate body for orders passed by the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). All of this puts a tremendous amount of workload on the NCLTs and NCLATs, which results in inefficiency to roll out the insolvency proceedings in the prescribed time-bound manner. Hence there is an exigency to reappraise the usefulness of the role of courts in the CIRP process.\n\nThe plausible solutions to these problems are as follows:\nEven though a few junctures of a restructuring process necessitate judicial participation, the bulk of technical processes could be handled outside the courts in theory. As a result, courts' workload could be reduced, allowing them to focus on the prompt resolution of those complex matters that require court intervention. Restricting the role of the courts to situations when it is necessary to increase overall productiveness by allowing the exit of unviable businesses (which in turn strengthens market selection). This change should be accomplished as soon as possible so that precious resources can be released and redirected to more productive purposes. It is a known fact that all insolvency cases do not take 270 days to be dealt with, as some matters are of smaller nature and take lesser time to resolve. Hence it would undoubtedly be very beneficial to view insolvency resolution cases through the lens of a multi-route stratagem. The Woolf committee too implemented a similar method in England in 1998. The multi-track procedure yields a malleable system and does not give any uniform system for handling cases, unlike the rigid systems offered for claims in the fast track or the small claims track. On the contrary, it provides a diverse array of tools for the management of cases. These tools include standard directions, pre-trial evaluation, and conferences on case management,  and they can be employed in a flexible combination manner to cater to the requirements of individual cases.  Hence, three tracks could be proposed based on the default threshold taking inspiration from the Woolf committee. These are as follows:-\nthe fast tracks;\nthe small claims track; and\nthe multi-track.\nPersistent delays with respect to the execution of the code could be alleviated if, in addition to the already existing compulsory overall timeline for CIRP, compulsory timelines are incorporated in all junctures of CIRP. For example, we could have a deadline for the phase of admission of the application by NCLT, a deadline for the approval of the resolution plan, and so on for the remaining aspects. The inclusion of consolidated timelines such as these might result in a change in behaviour of the courts in executing such steps in a strict manner and not just keeping the overall deadline in hindsight. Parallel reasoning could be established from the indirect taxation mechanism in India that existed before the introduction of GST. The rules prior to GST were poorly formulated and barely eased the adjudication of demand notices under strict schedules, as opposed to the present GST law that has included the word 'shall' at various points to ensure quick resolution.   \nThe government can also designate specific benches of NCLT for the sole purpose of hearing insolvency petitions. The same was also expressed by the Standing Committee on Finance in its report on the subject ‘Implementation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)-Pitfalls and Solutions’ released on August 3, 2021. Alternatively, the government can also establish a separate tribunal for hearing petitions filed under the Companies Act and appeals filed against the orders of CCI to reduce the burden of the excess workload from NCLTs and NCLATs. In the meantime, supplementary courts may be assigned to the NCLTs which experience heavy IBC traffic, such as Mumbai and Delhi.\nConclusion\n\nThe IBC was envisioned as a revolutionary step towards ease of doing business in the facet of the Indian economy. But the unrequited delays in the resolution process, which were the primary reason for the failure of its predecessor, are persistent in the IBC even after revamping the whole insolvency framework. These backlogs foster several problems, such as exorbitant haircuts (amount of dues forgone) during the resolution process, commercial uncertainty, an increase in the non-performing assets, and the destruction of the value of existing assets. These factors have been a major blow to the rapidly expanding Indian economy.\n\nThus, in light of dealing with these persistent problems, we have tried to provide some novel solutions in the aforementioned discussion. These solutions, if implemented in the right way, can prove to be invaluable in the struggle against rampant insolvency resolution delays.   \nIBCInsolvency\nInsolvency Law\n406 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Causes of Inordinate Delays in the IBC and the Elixir to Cure Them - Part I",
        "content": "Arun Raghuram Mahapatra, Akshat Verma\nApr 10, 2022\n7 min read\nCauses of Inordinate Delays in the IBC and the Elixir to Cure Them - Part I\n[Akshat and Arun are students at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Patiala, Punjab.]\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) was drafted to strengthen and revise the laws pertaining to insolvency resolution in India. Its main aim is to ensure a time-bound process for maximizing the value of assets, promoting ease of doing business, enhancing the accessibility of credit, and balancing the interests of all the relevant stakeholders. \n\nHowever, even after the passage of five and a half years since the code coming into force on 28 May 2016, the scenario is looking grim. The 32nd report of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs Standing Committee on Finance on the 'Implementation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code- Pitfalls and Solutions' represented a very dire status quo concerning the pendency of applications before the adjudicating authority. The committee observed that the average time to resolve insolvency is 1.6 years in 2020 which is way past the prescribed time limit of 330 days. It also noted that low recovery rates with delays in the resolution process point towards a deviation from the original objectives of the code. Recently, in Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited & Another, the Supreme Court once again urged the NCLT and NCLAT to adhere to the time limit stipulated under the IBC and clear pending resolution plans within the deadline of 330 days.\n\nIn this article, we shall try to analyze and scrutinize some of the primary reasons for the delay in the insolvency process. We would also try to propose solutions to those problems in a bid to rescue the IBC from becoming a lost cause like its predecessors due to inordinate delays.\n\nInsolvency Professionals: The Under-Developed Foundation\n\nInsolvency professionals are certified persons who are enrolled with an insolvency agency and are involved in the dissolution operation of insolvent individuals, businesses, limited liability partnerships, or other partnerships. These specialists have the authority to act on behalf of bankrupt businesses, persons, and other entities.\n\nThese professionals have a critical function in the liquidation of an entity's assets and other settlement activities during a bankruptcy situation. Their primary function is to assess the financial position of a business, company, or partnership organization. If they believe it is possible to restart the firm’s operations after careful analysis, they employ all their efforts and techniques to resolve its distress. To be succinct, they are the technical backbone of any insolvency resolution process.\n\nHence, it can be inferred from the above facts that the dearth of insolvency professionals can cause a severe backlog in the insolvency resolution processes around the country. And in India, the same has been a persistent problem for many years, as even now, there are only 2,977 registered (with valid authorisation for assignment) insolvency professionals. While this number might seem decent, it is not comparable to the number of cases pending before the NCLT (there are 13,170 IBC cases pending before the NCLT as of 3 August 2021).\n\nThere are two routes to gain eligibility for the Limited Insolvency Examination (LIE) and subsequent procedures that lead to the final certification by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). And it is in these eligibility routes where complications start cropping up.\n\nThe first eligibility process is for the professionals (Advocates, Company Secretariats, Chartered Accountants) who have the requisite experience. This procedure is very long and stringent as it mandates a minimum of 10 years of experience for applicants in their respective fields. The process is even more arduous for simple graduates, requiring a whopping 15 years of managerial experience. As one can see, this excessive demand for work experience is unreasonable as in-any-event an applicant has to give the LIE afterward to prove their knowledge. Furthermore, most experienced professionals are not likely to switch professions and become Insolvency Professionals as they might already be well-settled in their respective fields. \n\nThe government, too, identified the shortcomings of the first route and introduced a more lenient pathway in the form of the Graduate Insolvency Programme (GIP) course in 2019. The GIP offers a shortcut to bypass the experience gap as it allows young aspiring professionals to apply for LIE right after the 2-year course. However, this route is also not devoid of problems. The problem, in this case, is the minimalistic intake of GIP (52 students yearly intake in Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) since 2019, and an additional 40 students intake in National Law Institute University (NLIU), Bhopal starting in 2021). Hence, due to the sparse number of seats, it does not efficiently fast-track the process of creating more insolvency professionals.\n\nIn response to the problems highlighted above, a few suggested solutions are as follows:-\n\nThe reason given for the limited intake as per the government is to facilitate effective learning. However, this reasoning is flawed as in reality it tries to cover up for the faults of the administration for not investing in the infrastructure and expansion of teaching capacity. The government should take necessary steps to bolster the capacity of the institutes and increase the intake of the existing GIP at IICA and NLIU. \nGIP should be introduced in other national law and management institutes in a fashion similar to that of NLIU. The other private institutes which possess the requisite infrastructure and teaching capacity should be encouraged and incentivized by the government to introduce GIP or equivalent courses.\nSensitization of students about the field of insolvency is the need of the hour, and the portfolio of an Insolvency Professional should be projected/advertised as a lucrative career option. The young students need to be made aware of insolvency as a new, upcoming, in-demand, and unsaturated field filled with opportunities. In this regard, the IBBI had asked various Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), National Law Universities (NLUs), professional bodies like ICAI and ICSI, and other institutions of learning to help promote research and raise awareness about insolvency and bankruptcy. However, a lot more effort is still required.\n\nThe Dearth of Information Utilities: A Need for Fresh Air\n\nInformation Utilities (IUs) are organizations that behave as databases of financial information which receive, authenticate, maintain and deliver financial information pertaining to a debtor. Their information network stores financial data like borrowings, defaults, security interests, etc. They provide the aforementioned information to businesses, financial institutions, adjudicating authorities, insolvency professionals, and other relevant stakeholders. This kind of data transfer aims to facilitate and speed up the insolvency resolution process. The definition, eligibility, and registration procedures of an IU are codified in Section 3(21), Section 209, and Section 210 of the IBC, respectively.\n\nIUs have an indispensable role in limiting the time required in the Insolvency Resolution processes. Without them, there would not be a one-stop solution for all insolvency-related information leading to even more elongated periods for the resolution process. Furthermore, the authenticity of data cannot be verified without IUs. Hence, a dearth of IUs in India is a grave concern.\n\nThe National e-Governance Services (NeSL), India's first and the only registered IU under the IBBI, got its registration in 2017. Despite there being a detailed ruleset for new registrations under the IBBI and sufficient scope for new players to enter the field, there have been no new registrations since the maiden one. On a closer look, the possible explanations for the lack of registrations can be traced to the eligibility criteria of registration for the IUs.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for the IUs mandates that a company must have a minimum net worth of INR 50 crores, which is five times the minimum amount needed for a company to be identified as large-scale in India. This high economic hurdle automatically eliminates small-scale companies, which otherwise could have been potential IUs. G-Square, Realbox, Aureus Analytics, and other top emerging data analytics companies (having net worth less than INR 50 crores) which could have hoped to diversify and become an IU cannot do so because of the said restriction. Additionally, the criteria for eligibility also says that the sole object of the company should be to provide core services and other services under the IU Regulations and discharge such functions as may be necessary for providing these services. Effectively, this means that the only way for the company to make turnover is by charging fees for the services they can provide as an IU. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that only companies that already deal with data management and core services would be interested in becoming an IU. The companies that deal with other areas would not find it profitable to diversify and become an IU. For example, a well-established company like Reliance or Tata, having chains of businesses, cannot enter into this field directly, and the only way they can enter is by creation/investment in a new and independent body. The creation of an independent body is a cumbersome process, and this restriction could result in companies going into the general data analytics/management sector rather than the niche IU sector. These companies would be interested in the creation of an independent body only if the profits are worth their time and effort.\n\nIn response to the problems highlighted above, a few suggested solutions are as follows: -\nThe minimum net worth criteria could be reduced to allow more players to come into the IU field. Start-ups and medium-scale companies are the future of India, and they should be encouraged to join this field as well.\nTo make the role of an IU profitable for companies, the base charges/fees applied on core services could be slightly hiked. Furthermore, the fees can be substantially hiked for subsequent submissions, revisions, or error rectification. Steps such as these would not only create greater profits but would also result in a more holistic verification of data, as for every error, there would be a penalty in the form of hiked prices. It would also lead to lesser erroneous/wrong information, which is the primary cause of delay in insolvency proceedings.\nThat concludes this part of the two-part blog. The next part of the post discusses the need for judicial delays pertaining to the NCLT and NCLAT benches in the country and concludes the article.\nIBCInsolvency\nInsolvency Law\n352 views\n12 likes.

        "title": "Public Policy Exception to Proposed Cross-Border Insolvency Law – Two Problems & Proposed Amendments",
        "content": "Dharmendra Chatur\nApr 7, 2022\n4 min read\nPublic Policy Exception to Proposed Cross-Border Insolvency Law – Two Problems & Proposed Amendments\n[Dharmendra is a Partner in the Dispute Resolution practice group at Poovayya & Co, and an incoming LLM candidate at University of Chicago Law School, Class of 2023.]\n\nThis article deals with two problematic aspects and proposes amendments to the public policy exception (PPEx) contained in §4 of the recently released draft of India’s cross border insolvency law – titled “Draft Part Z” (“DPZ”) – which, when enacted, will amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. DPZ adopts the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency 1997 (Model Law), and introduces multiple forward-looking principles relating to: (a) providing access to foreign insolvency professionals and creditors to domestic insolvency proceedings in India; (b) recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency proceedings by Indian courts with standards for determining the concurrent foreign main or non-main proceedings; and (c) cooperation and coordination between Indian and foreign courts and insolvency professionals. \n\nContrary to the progressive intent behind enacting a certain and holistic cross-border insolvency law, the PPEx empowers the adjudicating authority (either the National Company Law Tribunal or the Debts Recovery Tribunal) to refuse to take ‘any’ action under DPZ if “in its opinion, the implementation of such action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of India”. The opinion of the adjudicating authority is contingent on the Indian government’s submissions before any final determination. Additionally, the government has been granted suo motu powers to cause refusal of any action by the adjudicating authority, if the government opines that it is manifestly contrary to the public policy of India. \n\nThe contours of the doctrine of public policy have been left to be interpreted by courts through judicial precedents in India, as no law defines it (reference State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata [(2005) 12 SCC 77)]. These precedents, though, have been inconsistent – the Indian Supreme Court categorizes public policy as imprecise, changing from time to time with changing circumstances (reference DTC v. Majdoor Congress [1991 Supp (1) SCC 600]), and advised against its conceptual rigidity in the interest of societal stability (reference BCCI v. Cricket Assn. of Bihar [(2015) 3 SCC 251)]). As a result, the scope and application of the doctrine is one of the most contentious debates in Indian law[i].\n\nIn the DPZ, however, the invocation and application of the PPEx creates an intrinsic defect in the law where the exception swallows the rule(s). In one fell swoop, the purpose behind enactment of the Model Law in India can be rendered otiose. This is despite use of the qualifying term “manifestly contrary to” before “public policy”, which is advocated in the UNCITRAL Guide to Enactment and Interpretation of the Model Law, as a necessary countervailing force to militate against overbroad and expansive interpretation of the phrase “public policy”.\n\nDespite use of the “manifestly contrary” qualification, the PPEx is an unworkable safety valve and needs to be altogether omitted or modified, as below: \n\nOutsourcing of judicial function for determination of “manifestly contrary to public policy”: Unlike the US, India follows a broad separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary. Despite established practice that the interpretation of law should be the judiciary’s sole prerogative, the PPEx introduces a third party, i.e., the government, into the interpretative exercise. The government ought not educate the adjudicating authority as to what “manifestly contrary to public policy” is or should be. In doing so, the DPZ outsources an essential judicial function – interpretation of law – to the government. Moreover, the authority may be reluctant to disregard the opinion of the government, as its final opinion is predicated on the government’s submissions. This disregards India’s federal legal system and creates an overbearing central government which will be empowered to opine on aspects that are neither within its legislative or executive domain.\n\nNarrowing down: The UNCITRAL Guide’s prescription for narrowing and restricting the application of the public policy exception by introducing the “manifestly contrary to” qualifier has been followed by many countries, including the USA [ii]. American scholarship on the interpretation of the public policy exception has expounded that recourse to the exception should be the last resort in refusing any insolvency action, and that an effort should be made to rely on other grounds already available within the text of the law to refuse any action [iii]. DPZ already contains grounds on which relief can be refused to protect the interests of the creditors, the corporate debtor, or other interested persons (reference §19, DPZ). The uncertainty of the public policy exception in Indian arbitration law necessitating parliamentary intervention by narrowing it down [iv]. Unless narrowed, the PPEx will also lead to a multiplicity of litigation requiring judicially interpretation of its scope. The American caselaw and legislative experience is illuminative on how the framework of DPZ itself can be sufficient to protect the interests of subjects of the insolvency regime, without resorting to the public policy exception.\n[i] For example, in Indian arbitration law, see Anirudh Hariani, Indian Arbitration and the Shifting Sands of Public Policy, 16(2) Asian Int’l Arb.

        "title": "Market Definition, Power in Digital Economy and Challenge of Zero Price Markets: Time to Evolve?",
        "content": "Debargha Mukherjee\nApr 7, 2022\n6 min read\nMarket Definition, Power in Digital Economy and Challenge of Zero Price Markets: Time to Evolve?\n[Debargha is a student at ILS Law College, Pune. The following post is one of the winning entries in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co]\n\nA competition analysis usually starts by defining relevant antitrust markets and an assessment of whether the enterprise/firm which is being scrutinised holds market power in their relevant market. Market power is the ability to raise prices profitably above the marginal cost or the ability to lower quality or output below that which would exist in a competitive market while still maintaining profitable sales levels. It is known that digital markets post explicit analytical challenges, yet, competition enforcements have always been inclined to endorse the flexibility, applicability and resilience of current analytical structures for market definition and power.  That said, analysis of market power in the digital space seeks to define relevant markets, post which evaluation of barriers to entry/expansion, competitive constraints, scale of advantages, etc. are done (similar to traditional markets). Enforcement commissions also realise that digital markets exhibit special characteristics like rampant network effects, importance of non-price competition, low-variable costs, etc. which possess direct impacts on competition analysis, thereby adding to the already-existing complexity.  Privacy has not been under the radar expressly for analysis of market power definition (yet). Commissions have concentrated on concerns posed by digital markets, including the role of data in competition, and challenges of zero-price products, amongst others. These are reviewed herein as considerations which may merge with privacy and its enforcers. Evidently, price cannot form the base for competition in zero-price markets; thus, it is argued that privacy and other product qualities might undertake a noticeable role in competition in such prevailing markets.\n\nMarket Definition and Privacy: Can They be Interlinked?\n\nAnalysis of market definition tends to have a base on buyers’ views about which locations or products are relatively interchangeable for the same objective, based on considerations like quality, price, etc. This is where the SSNIP (small but significant non-transitory increase in price) test comes in which is a common analytical tool used to assess replaceability (and define markets). The market is defined to be comprised of the group of services over which the monopolist could profitably impose a SSNIP, rather than losing profits from sales diverted to the next-best substitute. Herein, it is essential to note that SSNIP focusses on price-change solely, which would ideally not work in zero-price markets because in such markets, consumers do not pay any fee for the service or product which they use. Other non-price factors drive consumers and their product choices.   \n    In such scenarios of zero-price markets, competition authorities like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Singapore Competition and Consumer Commission have opined that focus should shift from ‘price change’ to ‘quality change’, or in other words, opt for the SSNDQ (small but significant non-transitory decrease in quality) test in order to define relevant antitrust markets for enterprises and firms. This would mean that products would be considered to be in one class/the same relevant market when a monopolist would reduce a “product quality parameter” in a small but significant non-transitory manner without missing its consumers. This test was seen to be used by the Chinese Competition Authority in the case of Qihoo v. Tencent. There exist almost no occurrences where the SSNDQ approach with a specific consideration given to ‘privacy protection’ was used for defining a relevant market. If privacy is deemed a substantial element of quality-based competition among the services and products, then the SSNDQ test may possibly be used to evaluate whether monopolists are able to gainfully enforce a decrease in privacy quality. That said, it ought to be accepted that this approach will possibly be more difficult to set up when compared to the regular price-based approach. Measurement of privacy effects is challenging owing to the discrepancy in user privacy inclinations. Thus, market definitions may need to follow perceptions from behavioural economics to understand user biases. In traditional models, demand curves are relatively linear and orderly which means if the price moves down, then demand moves up, however, this ceases to be true when prices drop to zero (as it is the case in zero-price markets. It is evident that all these added up, ought to make the process of defining markets even more complex. \n\nYet another approach to define markets is to focus on the sustainability of the function provided by a product or service in a market without taking the quality change model into consideration. For instance, if a social media application is employed to connect people in a professional setup with each other and for job hunting, then other apps which provide interchangeable functionality would be considered within one class/same relevant market. This approach however is subjected to widespread criticism because it lacks analytical rigour when compared to the standard SSNIP test. \n\nUltimately, another possibility is the SSNIC [small but significant and non-transitory increase in (exchanged) costs] test which measures changes in the costs consumers pay for a free good in a non-monetary currency viz. information or attention. For instance, investigators analysing a merger between a couple of search providers might ask whether a ten percent increase in the ‘number’ of advertisements would cause search customers to substitute away to a different product. Similarly, the number can be replaced with length or duration, etc. That said, enforcement agencies might base its market definition in part on the evidence of past increases in the levels of information or attention costs extracted by participants of the market. This approach ought to have some downsides and difficulties as was the case with other approaches because attention or information costs vary from person to person, and are entirely heterogenous in nature. \n\nGiven the challenges in all these alternative tests, all in all, it still stands true that demand substitution is one of the most sort-after approaches to define relevant markets. However, as markets develop, the price-based approach ought to change while determining market definitions in zero-cost markets. \n\nMarket Power: Network Effects and the Role of Data\n\nThe correlation between market power and privacy is dubious. Focus of competition regulators have continuously been on whether/when data might confer market power, and not on privacy or personal data as such. That said, numerous reports on the antitrust law and digital markets have pondered whether the scope of data collection acts as a barrier to entry/detrimental to competition.[1] The Competition Commission of India, the French and the German Competition Authorities have clearly cited that collection of data may result in entry barriers when new entrants are unable to collect such data/buy access to the same kind of data in terms of its volume or variety as established companies. Some competition regulators have also diverted their attention to the possibility of data-driven feedback loops, wherein incumbents with superior data access are better able to improve and refine their data-driven products.[2] It is true that such feedback loops may represent good competition as services and products are getting improved to the benefit of the users, however, it could also possibly create a barrier to entry and expansion for new entities who do not have similar data-driven advantage and funds. \n\nApart from data, there has been considerable focus on the role of network effects in bolstering the market power. These effects take place in numerable data services types like gig economy services, etc. wherein the greater the user database, the more the enterprises’ value would be. Network effects evidently act as barrier to entry as it raises switching costs for users, thereby rendering markets prone to focus on the services of a large and single provider. Google’s dominance over the past few years in online search and advertising is a classic example of how network effects are created and operate as a barrier to entry and expansion for other newer services. Regulators have also acknowledged that network effects amplify the competitive viability of a new entrant to any relevant market as it could be seen in the Immonet/Immowelt merger case placed before the German Competition Authority.   \n\nLastly, it is evident that market shares play an influential role in evaluations of market power. High market share in a relevant market might not be adequate to determine market power, but it impacts considerably. That said, in some zero-price markets, market share determination ought to be distinct when compared to price-driven markets where profit shares are used to calculate market share and power. Zero-price markets may measure market share on the basis of interactions of users with the apps, user database (transactions, searches, time spent on the app), etc. \n\nConclusions\n\nIt is true that there exist several challenges for competition law albeit theoretically whilst defining zero-price markets and measurement of market share in the digital space. However, in practice, these issues have not thwarted competition commissions and regulators until now. That said, competition law and economics highly and heavily depend on the existence of positive prices. However, services and products are increasingly being offered in exchange of users’ information and attention, and not in exchange of their money. In the coming years, many standard tools used by competition regulators and commissions will be difficult or impossible to use in zero-price markets. Thus, they ought to adapt to the changes and evolve in the face of zero-price markets to perform their delegated role of preserving and maintain competition in the market. Additionally, data privacy is something which authorities have not used until now to analyse market definition and power. If privacy becomes essential to analyse these, the expertise of data privacy authorities in evaluating and measuring privacy will be vital in notifying the competition analysis. \n[1] Jason Furman et. al, Report on the Digital Competition Expert Panel: Unlocking Digital Competition (UK), 9 (2014). \n[2] Ibid at 33. \nZero-PriceMarketsCCI\nCompetition Law\n599 views\n11 likes.

        "content": "Kavya Jha, Rishabh Chhabaria\nApr 3, 2022\n8 min read\nAftermarkets and the Aftermath: A Competition Law Perspective\n[Kavya and Rishabh are students at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Punjab. The following post won the third prize in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nAn important aspect of competition law is the delineation of a relevant market. This helps in assessing the dominance of an entity in that market for determination of the abusive conduct as per Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 (Act). In certain cases involving a primary product and secondary products (i.e., complementary products and services required after the purchase of the primary product), a separate “aftermarket” may be delineated. An aftermarket refers to a secondary product market, distinct from the primary product market, covering only secondary products and services relating to the primary product. \n\nCompetition issues in aftermarkets, such as charging locked in consumers with exploitative prices for after-sale services of the primary product, are globally recognised. International and national competition regulators have relied on factors such as ‘whole life costing analysis’, ‘reputational concerns’ and ‘switching costs’ to determine if a separate aftermarket exists. \n\nWhile the Act comprehensively lays down the factors to be relied upon while delineating the relevant market, it fails to provide clear direction on factors relevant for delineation of separate aftermarkets. In this context, this essay argues that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has adopted an incongruent approach to the factors used in delineating separate aftermarkets. To demonstrate this, it analyses four factors used in aftermarket delineation — whole life costing analysis, product lifespan, reselling options, and product price. Finally, it argues for a consistent and balanced approach to be followed by the CCI in weighing the factors for aftermarket delineation. \n\nTrends of CCI\n\nOne of the earliest references to the concept of separate aftermarkets in India can be found in the dissenting opinions of CCI member R. Prasad in cases such as Surinder Bhakoo v. HDFC Bank Limited and Pravahan Mohanty v. HDFC Bank Limited. While dealing with allegations of abuse of the dominant position held by the bank, he identified that there would exist an aftermarket involving only the bank and a customer due to the existence of the factors of ‘information asymmetry’ (i.e. lack of information or inability of a consumer to understand the information provided to them, thereby preventing a consumer from  making an informed choice) and high ‘switching costs’ (i.e. the financial burden a consumer will have to incur to switch to the product or services of another competing manufacturer). \n\nHowever, it was only in Shamsher Kataria v. Honda Siel (Shamsher Kataria) that these factors were exhaustively analysed by the CCI. It was held that in place of a unified systems market, an aftermarket would be delineated on the existence of certain factors including substantial switching costs, the inability of the consumers to engage in ‘whole life costing’ (i.e. determining the cost that would be incurred in the lifetime of the product) and ‘reputational concerns’ not acting as a deterrent (i.e., when the manufacturer may choose to charge exploitative prices from their locked-in consumers for repairs and after sale services without considering the impact it would have on its reputation). Further, while dealing with switching costs, the CCI highlighted that consumers would have to incur a loss when they attempt to sell their product and switch to another, due to depreciation in value.\n\nSubsequent cases mention these broad factors while considering the delineation of a separate aftermarket. Yet, the CCI, in most of these cases (discussed below) did not comprehensively consider all the factors and preliminary dismissed the complaint under Section 26(2) of the Act. Furthermore, the CCI’s interpretation and application of the factors has also been inconsistent. This will be elaborated further in the next section.  \n\nAnalysing the Incongruity in CCI’s Approach\n\nIn this section, the incongruent approach adopted by the CCI while considering factors used in delineating separate aftermarkets is analysed by juxtaposing the orders given by the CCI in Shamsher Kataria, Shri Amitabh v. Kent RO Systems (Kent RO), Trend Electronics v. Hewlett Packard India Sales (Trend Electronics) and the more recent case of In Re Star Imaging and Path Lab v. Siemens Limited (Siemens).\n\nWhole Life Costing Analysis\n\nThe CCI, in Shamsher Kataria, held that the relevant product market in the automobile industry can be classified under the heads of primary market, consisting of manufacture and sale of automobiles, and an aftermarket for spare parts and after sale services. While delineating the aftermarket, one of the key factors that CCI relied on was that an Indian consumer does not undertake a whole life costing analysis while purchasing the product. Relying on the United States’ Supreme Court decision in Eastman Kodak Company v. Image Technical Services, the CCI held that at the time of purchasing the product, a consumer should be adept in assessing the whole life cost that the product will incur during its lifespan. For determining this whole life cost, the consumer should have access to information specifying the price of the products that would be needed to maintain or enhance the primary product, repairs that will be required, service costs etc. The CCI further noted that such ‘raw data’ may not be provided to the consumers at the time of making the purchase. However, even if it is made available in the public domain, most of the consumers would lack the sophistication to analyse and determine the life  costs of the product.\n\nContrastingly, in the case of Trend Electronics, the CCI refused to bifurcate an aftermarket for service and repair of laptops and held that at the time of purchasing, a consumer can reasonably assess the cost they would incur in the lifespan from the information that is available publicly.\n\nThese two cases are representative of the opposite end of the spectrum while dealing with the factor of whole life costing analysis. On the one hand, the CCI in the case of Shamsher Kataria, while relying on studies that date back to three decades, has adopted a rigid stance with respect to a consumer’s ability to determine the whole life cost of a product. Based on the CCI’s conclusion that the Indian consumer does not have the sophistication to analyse the information and undertake a life-costing analysis, an aftermarket may be delineated even in a case where the manufacturer has provided the information publicly. This approach seems to be lopsided and goes against the interests of manufacturers of primary products. On the other hand, it must be observed that this factor was only superficially examined in Trend Electronics, wherein the CCI failed to account for the fact that the consumers may not be able to make an informed choice by conducting a life costing analysis due to unavailability of important information on a product.\n\nA more balanced approach was adopted by the CCI in Kent RO and Siemens. In these cases, the CCI noted that the consumers had access not only to the price of the product but also the average maintenance costs by way of the annual maintenance contracts that were negotiated at the time of the purchase. Since these factors would help the consumer determine the future costs of owning the product, the CCI held that the consumers could determine the whole life cost of the product during purchase. This is a comprehensive approach to ascertaining the feasibility of the whole life costing analysis, as it takes into account the availability of both product prices and maintenance costs in the public domain.   \n\nLifespan of the Primary Product\n\nThe factor of the lifespan of the primary product, in determination of the existence of a separate aftermarket, has been inconsistently approached by the CCI. In Trend Electronics, the CCI considered the “high rate of obsoletion and low-life span of laptops” in holding that unfair business practices, while providing after-sale services, would affect the sales of laptops. It concluded that these reputational concerns would prevent the manufacturer of laptops from increasing costs in the aftermarket. Notably, the average lifespan of an HP laptop is three years. On the contrary, Ford’s argument about the average lifespan of a passenger vehicle being five years in India, was ignored by the Competition Appellate Tribunal in the appeal against Shamsher Kataria.[1] In other cases such as Kent RO and Siemens, the lifespan of the primary product was not considered at all. \n\nThe CCI was correct in identifying that a lower lifespan would make it easier for the consumer to switch from one primary product to another; however, it failed to identify what would be classified as a “low” lifespan. While the lifespan of a laptop (three years) was considered to be low, the lifespan of a Ford car (five years) was not taken into account. Furthermore, the CCI should be consistent and consider the lifespan of products as an important factor in determining aftermarket delineation. \n\nOption to Resell the Primary Product \n\nIn Shamsher Kataria, while discussing the switching costs, the CCI noted that the price of the purchased car would depreciate post registration, because of which consumers would incur a loss if they attempted to sell the second handed car and buy a new one. Thus, the CCI relied on the option of reselling the primary product at a loss to show the existence of switching costs. However, in later cases such as Trend Electronics and Kent RO, the CCI interpreted the option to resell in a diametric manner. In both these cases, the CCI noted that consumers have several options available to resell the used primary product, i.e., laptops and water purifiers respectively. The CCI held this to imply that the consumers can easily switch to a different brand of primary product if they wished, and thus denied the existence of substantial switching costs. \n\nArguably, the mere option to resell a used product should not suggest that the consumers can easily switch to a different primary product. Even though the loss in value due to depreciation may be more in case of cars, when a consumer attempts to sell a used laptop or water purifier, they would still incur a significant loss in value as the product would not be worth the same as a brand new one. While there exists an ambiguity caused by subsequent rulings, the obiter in Shamsher Kataria rightly identified the issue and should be followed consistently. \n\nPrice of the Primary Product \n\nIn Shamsher Kataria, the CCI had elaborated upon the role of “product price” in determining switching costs. Juxtaposing the average price of a car (INR 3 lakhs or more) to the average price of a Gillete razor (INR 500), the CCI stated that it is more likely in the case of the former, more expensive product that the consumer would continue paying exploitative prices for secondary products and services rather than switching to a primary product of a different brand. Per contra, the consumer of a razor could easily switch to a different brand of razors. \n\nWhile this reasoning is tenable, the range of product prices that might cause difficulties to the consumer base in shifting to a different brand is unclear. For instance, in Kent RO, the CCI found the price of water purifiers, ranging from INR 10,000 to INR 15,000, was not high enough to prevent consumers from switching to a different brand of water purifiers. Similarly, in Trend Electronics, laptop models priced around INR 25,000 to INR 35,000 were held to not have high switching costs, even though the monthly salary of Indians is averaged to be around INR 32,000. \n\nTherefore, this categorization by the CCI is arbitrary. Instead of preliminarily rejecting a separate delineation of an aftermarket based on the price of the primary product, the CCI should instruct the Director General to include factors such as the targeted consumer base and their average salary in its investigation report on the basis of which, the CCI can give a reasoned decision with respect to the impact of the product price. \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe discrepancy in CCI’s approach while delineating separate aftermarkets is a major hindrance to developing the jurisprudence in this sphere. In light of the growing competition law concerns in the aftermarket and in the absence of any specific guidance of the Act with respect to the delineation of separate aftermarkets, it is important that CCI takes a proactive role. While CCI may accept or refuse to recognise an aftermarket as the relevant market in adjudication of cases, it is imperative that the factors for the purposes of such delineation are comprehensively discussed and consistently interpreted. Further, the CCI should be vary of its extensive powers with respect to the imposition of penalties that may have profound adverse effects on commercial entities. In this regard, the CCI should adopt a consistent and balanced approach. \n[1] Toyota Kirloskar Motor (P) Ltd. v.

        "content": "Vedaant Agarwal, Shivankar Sukul\nApr 2, 2022\n11 min read\nTracing Reforms in Indian Securitization Regime: Careful Optimism or Throwing Caution to the Wind?\n[Vedaant and Shivankar are students at National Law University, Jodhpur. The following post won the second prize in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nThe Indian securitization market does not feature among the most dynamic or high stakes domains of finance in current times. The lack of investor appetite for securitization has in turn resulted in low volume of trade in the securitization market over the course of decades. In order to boost the performance of the securitization market, the government has recently taken several proactive steps to ensure higher liquidity in the market by freeing up the assets on the bank’s balance sheets to ensure higher credit availability in the economy. With a view to revitalizing the secondary market for standard assets, recently, RBI introduced the Master Directions on (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions 2021 and Master Directions on (Securitization of Standard Assets) Directions 2021. This was followed by a Report by the Sub-Committee to Review the Working of Asset Reconstruction Companies towards the end of the year. \n\nWhile the objective of the government was giving a much needed boost to the securitization market during the pandemic for increasing the liquidity in the sector, previous experiences with securitization are a testament to the fact that it requires a delicate balancing exercise between optimism and caution. The authors in this post seek to analyze the aforementioned reforms in the securitization market in this context.\n\nThe article will first briefly describe the legal regime governing securitization while understanding the implications of the changes brought in by the above discussed reforms. The latter part of the article will identify the pitfalls and benefits offered by the reforms such as anomaly created by the revised definition of 'securitization', dilution of risk retention requirements under the revised directions and proposed inclusion of ARCs in resolution of companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). In conclusion, the article will recommend the additional changes which can be incorporated in the Indian regime to rejuvenate the Indian securitization ecosystem.\n\nBackground \n\nIn India, securitization of standard assets and stressed assets is regulated under different frameworks. The securitization of stressed assets and their enforcement is formally governed and regulated by the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002 (SARFAESI Act), whereas securitization of standard assets was governed by master directions issued by the RBI from time to time.\n\nSecuritization of stressed assets \n\nThe primary aim of SARFAESI Act is to off-load the burden of non-performing assets (NPA) and relieve the ailing financial sector. The enactment, towards this end, envisages a market mechanism that reduces the time spent by banks and financial institutions on loan recovery process and enables them to salvage those NPAs by employing measures such as reconstruction or securitization. Resultantly, freeing-up the balance sheet of the banks so as to enable them to maintain liquidity in the market.\n\nThe SARFAESI Act, essentially, empowers the secured creditors (i.e. Banks and Financial Institution) to take possession of securities charged on the loans (classified as NPAs) without the intervention of the court. Once in possession, banks can transfer the stressed assets to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) towards immediate realization of its dues. The SPV would aggregate all such stressed assets to further re-package the loans through 'securitization' into marketable securities and sell the security receipt (SR) to the investors. Thus, in this context, securitization is the process of conversion of the underlying pool of stressed assets into marketable securities.\n\nAn important feature of this process, considered to be an innovation of the SARFAESI Act, is the introduction of Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC). These ARCs are companies registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under Section 3 of the SARFAESI Act to conduct the business of asset reconstruction and securitization. Accordingly, ARCs are those SPVs that take over the stressed assets from banks, clearing up their balance sheet. The main task is to convert this pool of NPAs into performing assets, while repacking and securitizing them into marketable securities. Accordingly, ARCs are expected to play a critical role in reducing the mounting NPAs, coupled with recovery of stressed business and assets.\n\nHowever, the performance of ARCs has been unsatisfactory, with uninspiring improvement in terms of resolution of stressed assets. This is mainly attributable to “vintage NPAs being passed on to ARCs, non-availability of additional funding for stressed borrowers, and difficulty in raising of funds by the ARCs”. Taking note of these challenges, RBI constituted the Committee to Review the Working of Asset Reconstruction Companies (Committee) to evaluate the business model of ARC. RBI released the report on 2 November 2021 which recommended inter alia early sale of stressed assets to ARC, transparency and uniformity in the process of sale, making additional funding available for stressed borrowers and infusing liquidity for ARC.\n\nSecuritization of standard assets \n\nSecuritization of standard assets is governed by the RBI, originally, under Guidelines on Securitization of Standard Assets vide circular dated 1 February 2006. Acknowledging the need for a robust securitization market in India, while incentivizing simpler securitization structures, RBI also recently issued two new master directions – RBI (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions 2021 and RBI (Securitization of Standard Assets) Directions 2021 vide circular dated 24 September 2021. These master directions, aimed at rejuvenating the securitization market, have introduced sweeping changes and reforms in the ecosystem. However, some pitfalls have also been created through this direction which the authors seek to analyze through this article. \n\nDefinition of Securitization of Standard Assets\n\nOne of the departures under the RBI (Securitization of Standard Assets) Directions 2021 from the previous regime is with respect to the definition of 'securitization'. The earlier definition of securitization as laid down in the revised master directions of 2012 specifically excluded the single assets from being securitized. To understand the counter-productive nature of securitization of single assets, it is necessary to discuss the objective of securitization.\n\nOne of the major objectives to securitize the assets is to ensure that the risk attached to the asset is redistributed and spread over a large base of investors so that no single investor or entity bears all the brunt of default in an underlying loan. The risk borne by the large set of investors is also greatly offset by pooling and tranching of different assets, which ensures that during the life of the transaction the risk of default is distributed among the tranches. In contrast, in single asset securitization, a solitary default has the risk of bringing the castle down.\n\nThis objective is affirmed by the definition of 'securitization' as it exists in the European Union which maintains 'tranching' and 'pooling' of assets to be crucial to classify any transaction as securitization. Similarly, the requirement of a transaction to distribute risk through subordination of tranches ensures that transactions should be structured in such a manner that a single default does not bring the transaction crashing like a house of cards. \n\nSimilarly, the definition of securitization as mentioned in the Basel III norms also provides that a structure can be classified as a securitization transaction if the cash flow from an underlying pool of assets is used to service at least two stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of credit risk. The requirement of the tranches to comprise two different assets is to mitigate the loss in case of default in either of the assets. This can be further affirmed by the following statement in the Basel III Norms:\n\n“The stratified/tranched structures that characterize securitizations differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in that junior securitization tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to more senior tranches, whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a matter of priority of rights to the proceeds of liquidation.”\n\nThis was the main reason why single asset securitization was excluded from the definition of securitization as it is counterintuitive to the objective of risk distribution. This was also identified by the 2012 Revision of RBI Guidelines on Securitization of Standard Assets. However, the banking regulator has included single asset securitization within the new definition. The authors consider this to be counterproductive, as rather than affirming the trust of investors, this will dissuade them from investing in the secondary market of loans due to lack of risk distribution, as the entire transaction will fail with a single default leaving the investors high and dry.\n\nEasing of Minimum Retention Requirement \n\nMRR for securitization of standard assets\n\nEconomic downturn in 2008 which had a debilitating impact all across the world economies was probably one of the darkest phases of the securitization. This was mainly fuelled by reckless securitization of asset backed mortgages and lack of due diligence by the originator banks, which led to massive fall in the prices of Asset Backed Securities (ABS). In response to that, the economies around the world sprung into action by mandating that originating banks have a “skin in the game”. This was ensured by directing them to hold a minimum percentage of the asset they seek to securitize, which came to be known as the Minimum Retention Requirement (MRR).\n While this ensures self-imposed checks and balances on the originating banks by aligning their interests with the performance of securities. It also adversely impacts their ability to securitize the assets as it leaves them reduced liquidity. Therefore it requires a careful balancing act between caution and optimism where erring on either side would entail disastrous outcomes.\n\nInterestingly, the United States, unarguably the country most affected by the 2008 recession, took the first steps very cautiously by fixing the rate of retention at an unreasonably high level of 20 percent under the first draft of the Dodd- Frank Act 2013. This was later eased in the revised draft to 5 percent in light of fierce opposition. This decreased rate of MRR was in line with the rates that prevailed in Japan and European Union conforming to the liberal ecosystem of the securitization market. \n\nHowever, astonishingly, India did not subscribe to this liberal rate and inhibited the securitization market by imposing a stricter limit of 10% for securitization of standard assets under the relevant RBI directions. This problem was also identified by the Report of the Committee on the Development of Housing Finance securitization Market where the increased rate of MRR was ascribed as the reason for lack of growth in the securitization market. Fortunately, this problem seems to have been solved by the recently issued RBI (Securitization of Standard Assets) Directions 2021 which reduces the MRR to 5%. According to the authors, this will definitely have a positive impact on the ability of the originator banks to securitize more assets in the coming period. However, staggered implementation of this rule to apply it to the loans with a maturity period of less than 24 months shows a hint of reluctance by the banking regulator to fully and confidently follow the international standards.\n\nMRR for securitization of stressed assets\n\nWhile this problem is solved in the market for standard assets, the securitization of stressed assets by the ARCs still requires it to maintain a ratio of 15:85 while issuing the SRs. The recent report released by the Committee has underlined the problem of lack of liquidity, inhibiting their growth. In this light they have suggested the RBI revise the minimum investment in SRs by an ARC at 15% of the lenders’ investment in SR or 2.5% of the total SR issued, whichever is higher. The authors are of the opinion that this seems to be a pragmatic position considering the low recovery rates of NPAs by ARCs so as to make sure that their interests are aligned with the performance of the securities. \n\nIncompatibility of ARC as a resolution applicant under IBC\n\nThe Committee in its report recommended that ARCs should be allowed to participate as a Resolution Applicant in the insolvency resolution process under IBC. This issue has been in the center of the storm since RBI rejected the resolution plan submitted by UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited in the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of Aircel Limited. While there has been strong legal opinion favoring the participation of ARCs in processes under IBC, the authors are of the firm belief that the same should not be implemented considering the incompatibility of ARCs under SARFAESI Act to resolve assets under IBC. Interestingly, one of the primary reasons to disallow ARC's participation is its specialized nature of business to recover the debt under the SARFAESI Act.\n\nOperational inefficiencies\n\nARC is an entity established with the sole focus of recovery of debt from stressed assets. Section 2(ba) of the SARFAESI Act defines ARC as an entity primarily established to conduct the business of securitization and asset reconstruction. To further this specialized business objective, an ARC under Section 9 can employ measures such as sale or lease of the business of the borrower, rescheduling the payment of debts, settlement of dues payable, and enforcement of security interest to effectively carry on asset reconstruction business. Notably, an ARC can also take over the management of the business or convert any portion of debt into equity of the borrower company. Since these later tools are also used under insolvency proceedings, the Committee endorsed ARC as a prime vehicle for resolution under the IBC. However, it ignored a very crucial aspect that ARC is envisioned as a debt recovery tool and not a mechanism to maintain the business as a going concern which forms the basis of IBC.\n\nIt is important to note that ARCs have rarely used its power to take over the management or convert debt to equity. As a matter of fact, the RBI’s report is a testament to this anomaly, wherein they have confessed to the fact that takeover of management or conversion of debt to equity has been negligible. The seldom use of such powers for resolution of stressed assets, translates into lack of willingness and operational inexperience on part of the ARC, dissuading its inclusion and participation under IBC.\n\nMoreover, even if ARC does opt to take over management of the company, Section 15(4) mandates the ARC to restore the management on complete realization of debt. Indicating the legislative intent to mandate ARC’s exit from the company post recovery of dues. Accordingly, the operational boundaries of ARC under the current framework makes it a dysfunctional resolution vehicle under IBC.\n\nRegardless, the Committee has argued that inclusion under IBC would allow ARCs to gain the necessary experience in resolution and revival of stressed assets. While the desirability and outcome is yet to be seen, its infeasibility is apparently visible under SARFAESI Act. This line of argument is antithetical to the scheme and purpose of SARFAESI Act, wherein the primary function of ARC is to offload NPAs from banks towards recovery of debt and hand the management back to promoters after realization of dues. \n\nCapital intensive\n\nThe resolution of stressed assets under IBC is a costly affair which requires extensive capital infusion by the incoming resolution applicant. Resultantly, the resolution applicant has to burn cash for an elongated timeline before being able to derive profits from these assets. \n\nHowever, ARCs are required to redeem SR’s within a period of maximum 8 years, meaning that ARCs cannot burn holes in their pocket and are required to recover their dues within a tight timeline. Accordingly, the luxury of a long gestation period is not available with ARCs making them unsuitable for resolution of stressed assets under IBC. Due to aforementioned reasons, it is apparent that ARCs governed under the framework of SARFAESI Act are only meant to recover the dues from stressed assets. They neither have the operation expertise, nor the structural compatibility to resolve the assets under the framework of IBC. Therefore, including them in the resolution mechanism under IBC is a big mistake.\n\nConclusion\n\nSecuritization plays an integral role in the period following recovery from pandemic by infusing liquidity into the market and freeing up banks resources for facilitating the credit disbursal. In this context, the proactive steps taken by RBI to revitalize the securitization regime are welcomed by the authors. However, there remain some creases to be ironed out for establishing a robust and stable framework.\n\nDespite being well intentioned, RBI goes overboard by relaxing the definition of securitization beyond necessary. In this pursuit, the banking regulator fails to conform to the fundamental objectives of securitization by ignoring the risk mitigation aspect of securitization and throwing caution to the wind. \n\nMoreover, the intermingling of ARCs with resolution under the IBC manifests a lack of clear approach in addressing the NPA crisis. In this context, authors express concerns regarding the incompatibility of SARFAESI and IBC and cautions against allowing ARCs to apply as resolution applicants under IBC. In conclusion, though RBI has erred in some respects, its resolve to re-energize the securitization market is commendable.\n\nIBCInsolvencySecuritization\nInsolvency Law\n337 views\n8 likes.

        "title": "Insolvency Arbitration : Dawn of a New Era in India",
        "content": "Yasaschandra Devarakonda, Sushmit Mandal\nMar 27, 2022\n10 min read\nInsolvency Arbitration : Dawn of a New Era in India\n[Yasaschandra and Sushmit are students at National Law University, Odisha. The following post is the winning entry in the Second IRCCL Blog Writing Competition (2021-22), organised in association with Khaitan & Co.]\n\nInsolvency and arbitration, seemingly at odds quite vigorously, in certain unique situations possess an overlap that requires legislative intervention or in its absence, judicial introspection. In India, a paradigm shift has been achieved in insolvency regulation post the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (Code) which has served as a potent tool to craft such processes into a time-bound and well governed affair, and its provisions have been given an overriding effect over all other legislations, as per Section 238. However, our intent here lies to first, take cognizance of the fact that the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) as envisioned in the Code - much publicised and often cumbersome in its technicalities – may not be the best procedure or provide the most appropriate outcome in all circumstances. Second, the principle of party autonomy may supplement CIRP in the time-tested halls of arbitration. The aim thus is to suggest a synergised framework offering the best of both regimes.\n\nStatus Quo: Interaction between Insolvency and Arbitration\n\nWhat perhaps makes an insolvency process via arbitration the most challenging is the strict dictum of the Supreme Court of India on the matter of arbitrability. There are two aspects to arbitrability - procedural and substantive. Procedural arbitrability refers to whether an arbitration agreement envisages within its scope, an arbitration of the dispute, while substantive arbitrability refers to whether the subject matter of the dispute is capable of arbitration as per the public policy. While engaging with this question, the apex court has drawn out a four-fold test in Vidya Drolia and Others v Durga Trading Corporation where the first limb states that the subject matter is non-arbitrable in a dispute where the “cause of action and subject matter of the dispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem”. This remains a crucial marker in any subsequent analysis of arbitrating insolvency proceedings. However, the court took cognizance of the fact that multiple jurisdictions allow inter partes arbitrations with respect to in rem rights via a statutory framework. It then contemplated upon its feasibility in India, in order to provide impetus to arbitration.\n\nThis brings a need to ponder on the many points where arbitration and insolvency proceedings find themselves in each other’s vicinity. The first situation that may arise is where ongoing arbitration proceedings involve the corporate debtor as one of the parties against which an insolvency application is brought under the Code. The fate of such proceedings seems sealed in the face of Section 14(a) where once a moratorium is declared by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the continuation of any such proceedings in any “arbitration panel” henceforth, becomes prohibited and thus stayed till the completion of the CIRP. Further, the NCLT has clearly held that the pendency of any such arbitral proceedings is not a hindrance to initiate a CIRP under the Code.\n\nThe above-mentioned provision also bars the institution of such arbitration proceedings which brings us to a second major overlap where parties may seek arbitration measures post the fact that an application has been made under the Code. While the legislation is clear on the declaration of a moratorium from the insolvency commencement date, several decisions have allowed us to better understand the timeline and point of no return. In Indus Biotech Private Limited v Kotak India Venture (Offshore) Fund (earlier known as Kotak India Venture Limited) and Others (Indus Biotech), a Section 8 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Arbitration Act) was made in addition to Section 7 of the Code to refer the parties to arbitration. Looking at the overlap, the Supreme Court has clarified that a mere application under the Code does not render insolvency proceedings to be one in rem and thus, non-arbitrable in nature. This occurs only when the application is admitted, leading to the creation of third-party rights against all creditors, and causes the manifestation of a corresponding erga omnes effect. However, the court also clarified that in the period post the admission of a petition and before the creation of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) – parties are allowed to approach the authority within the inherent powers granted to it under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules 2016 for matters of withdrawal or settlement. Thus, the true effect of the moratorium, and a bar on arbitration comes into play only post the formation of a CoC, when the in personam proceedings truly become in rem. It must be noted that the court did not delve into the powers of NCLT in an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act. Instead, it opined that the disposal of such an application would entirely depend on the outcome of the insolvency application under Section 7 of the Code without any independent appraisal of the former.\n\nThere is a need for a system that values party autonomy especially in disputes involving mixed questions of law such as those arising out of contracts and matters of insolvency, where a strict characterisation of the proceedings as those in rem does not remain a viable option. We thus feel the need for a system where, on demand from the parties, the NCLT is empowered to refer them to arbitration with the need for relevant legislative amendments so as to allow the arbitration proceedings to commence and conclude within the aegis of the insolvency regime under the Code. In such a case, a proposed insolvency arbitration structure has been quantified where the arbitral tribunal itself acts as an overseer of the insolvency process.\n\nArbitration of Corporate Insolvencies\n\nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Indus Biotech missed the opportunity to engage with the conjoint working of the Code and Section 8 of the Arbitration Act. Section 8 contemplates referral of the parties to an arbitration by a judicial authority before which an action is brought that is also the subject matter of a preexisting arbitration agreement. With no clear definition of ‘judicial authority’ in the Arbitration Act, it is not unwarranted to interpret NCLT within the ambit of this term. In the absence of a direct engagement via judicial interpretation, it is felt that a legislative amendment would fill the gap allowing for an effective entry point for an insolvency arbitration framework. Insertion of Section 8(4) in the Arbitration Act is thus recommended: “Judicial authority, for the purpose of this section, includes the National Company Law Tribunal constituted under Section 408 of the Companies Act, 2013.”\n\nCongruously, amendment must ensue via insertion of proviso to Section 6 of the Code: “Provided that, NCLT is empowered to direct the parties to an arbitration if there exists an agreement to arbitrate and an application is made under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.”\n\nUnder this proposed framework, to initiate CIRP, the applicant must approach the NCLT with an insolvency application under either Section 7 or 8 of the Code along with an application for referral to arbitration under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act and a copy of the agreement to arbitrate. Upon perusal of the agreement to arbitrate, which we propose must mandatorily contain the Code as one of the applicable laws, the NCLT would then direct the parties to arbitration without considering the insolvency application on merits. Absence of applicable law as the Code, or insufficient scope of the agreement to arbitrate would lead to procedural non-arbitrability.\n\nArbitrability of in rem rights\n\nBefore delving into the finer details of CIRP via arbitration, this framework must pass the test of the judicial dicta in India which prevents arbitral tribunals from arbitrating insolvency and winding off proceedings since they pertain to rights in rem. This position has however been changed since the recent judgement of Indus Biotech where the court held that CIRP can be bifurcated into ‘pre’ and ‘post’ the formation of CoC, and that the only question of non-arbitrability owing to the existence of in rem rights exists in the ‘post the formation of CoC’ phase. This significant development in the scrutiny must be met with jubilation while also enquiring on the precise nature and adjudication of the in rem rights in CIRP.\n\nWe argue that the in rem adjudication phase of post CoC formation is limited to the adjudication by the CoC. In the CIRP under the Code, subsequent to the presentation of all plans by Resolution Professional to the CoC, the approval of the plan must be done by CoC, the success of which would lead to the submission of the plan to the NCLT, or the failure of which would lead to the liquidation of the insolvent company by NCLT. The CoC’s determination on the success of the plan, which is indeed the only juncture where in rem rights are at stake, has no involvement of the NCLT. Challenge to the plan approved by CoC on procedural grounds must be delineated from substantive rights in rem that CoC decides upon.\n\nSimilarly, under the proposed framework, subsequent to the decision of the CoC, the tribunal, on the basis of such decision, would subject to procedural irregularities, pass an award in favor of the plan or order liquidation as the case may be. For the purposes of enforcement of the award, an analogous amendment must be brought into Section 31 of the Code along the lines of: “Provided further that, in relation to arbitral referrals made under Section 6, a copy of the award passed must be submitted to the Adjudicating Authority for an order to approve or reject the repayment plan on the basis of the award.”\n\nWith the understanding that the determination of CoC is the only in rem right sphere in the CIRP process, the proposed insolvency framework would pass the test of arbitrability of the law of the land.\n\nKompetenze Kompetenze and moratorium\n\nThe next important segment to train our lenses on is the status of the insolvency petition post referral by the NCLT. The arbitral tribunal, once duly constituted, has to decide first on the admissibility of the petition. The important principle of Kompetenze Kompetenze, as enshrined in Section 16 of the Arbitration Act provides for the power of tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Just as the NCLT decides on the same since it is authorized legislatively under Sections 7, 8 and 10 of the Code – similarly, the aforementioned principle will fortify the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to rule on such an insolvency petition brought to it for due assessment of its admissibility. This further also allows it to go into an assessment of the presence of a default as also provided in the Code, which finally again weighs down on the decision to admit such an insolvency petition.\n\nConsequently, the next aspect which becomes crucial is the declaration of a moratorium to preserve the value of the corporate debtor once the petition is admitted. Being of utmost importance, we feel that it is important to comply with this process via the NCLT’s jurisdiction and powers to declare the same under Section 13(1)(a) of the Code so as to utilize its overriding power under Section 238. This will prevent any undue challenges that may arise from an arbitral tribunal induced moratorium that can erode the value of the debtor. Thus, the ideal process would entail, a successful referral to arbitration by the NCLT within the Code – this would lead to constitution of the arbitral tribunal and a ruling by such tribunal on the admissibility of an insolvency petition making use of the principle of Kompetenze Kompetenze. Next, once the tribunal rules that such petition is admissible, the NCLT would then declare a moratorium, and the remaining process would continue within the aegis of the arbitral tribunal. Finally, the NCLT’s role would again become crucial in the post award stage when the award so passed containing the approved resolution plan would be given due enforcement with the NCLT’s approval under Section 31 of the Code.\n\nInsolvency Arbitration - The Way Forward\n\nArbitration is a highly nuanced and sophisticated manner of resolving disputes. Akin to various forms of arbitration such as commercial, investment, maritime and sports arbitrations, insolvency arbitration too will, with time, evolve into a niche of its own - reaping benefits that the arbitral system has to offer. As a consequence, it would also become a preferred manner of recouping for financially distressed companies, a specific consequence that is exasperated in the aftermath of COVID-19.\n\nIndisputably, the comfort of control over the appointment of the arbitral tribunal via party appointed arbitrators who would in turn appoint a chair arbitrator is lacking in the present CIRP under the Code. Further, arbitration is also convenient in terms of setting up of the hearings, at whichever venue, and date as desired amongst the parties. Other than the time-bound nature of CIRP, arbitration offers a flexible process. Under this framework, the date on which the award is rendered must be considered for the 330-day deadline within which the CIRP must be completed under the Code, which is analogous to the time-bound nature of rendering arbitral award within twelve months under Section 29A of the Arbitration Act. The framework thus does not overtly disturb the insolvency timelines in India.\n\nOne crucial aspect that needs a deep understanding is confidentiality of arbitral process. While confidentiality is, undeniably, a major attraction for debt ridden companies to avoid further decline in market value, the mandatory public disclosure requirement for invitation of claims and subsequent invitation of Expression of Interest (EOI) appears to supersede company preference. Reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory interests could follow in two prongs. First, arbitral hearings can be held behind closed doors with a veil of secrecy protecting the insolvent company and its image from media spotlight and scrutiny. Secondly, as for the documents, and crucially the award itself, a familiar concept of redacted arbitral awards and arbitral documents would come to rescue. Importantly, respondents of EOIs must be roped into the arbitration with strict confidentiality clauses regarding the financials of the corporate debtor.\n\nWhile it appears that confidentiality of arbitration alone would be a deal breaker to attract companies to prefer arbitration led CIRP to the current one under the Code, it must be born in mind that at the crux of the entire framework lies a very liberal interpretation of who decides on the in rem rights involved in the CIRP. Indus Biotech, in many ways rattled the feathers off the primeval understanding of the extent of arbitrability in insolvency. The understanding thus, that in rem rights are solely determined by the CoC, with hardly any intervention by the NCLT save as in extreme cases of irregularities, whilst ambitious and liberal, is quite necessary for arbitration to meet insolvency amidst the rise in corporate insolvencies in the aftermath of COVID-19, thus leading a transnational crusade to a novel approach in business and commerce.\nInsolvencyArbitrabilityCorporate Insolvency Resolution Process\nDispute Resolution\n875 views\n3 likes.

        "content": "Anuraag Bukkapatnam\nMar 7, 2022\n6 min read\nDCF v/s NAV- Examining Valuation Concerns under the Income Tax Act\n[Anuraag is a student at NALSAR University of Law.]\n\nThe increasing popularity of the show ‘Shark Tank India’ has led to a renewed interest in the world of start-up funding in India. In particular, the negotiation between the sharks and potential recipients of the investment regarding terms of the investment has generally been one of the most exciting segments of the show. A high valuation investment by the sharks is often perceived as a ‘victory’ for the recipients, as the same validates the soundness of their business plan and strategy. However, not many are aware of the manner in which higher valuations could potentially attract the attention of the income tax department. This can take place when the investment received by a company to expand its operations is itself is deemed to be the income of the company and taxed accordingly by the authorities. The same is made possible by virtue of Section 56(2)(viib) and Section 2(24)(xvi) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (IT Act), which brings such share premiums under the scope of ‘income from other sources’. \n\nThis article seeks to explore the on-going controversy regarding the appropriate method of valuation to be adopted for the purposes of valuing equity under Section 56(2)(viib) of the IT Act. In particular, the controversy is viewed from the lens of a recent ruling by the Mumbai Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in the case of DCIT v. Creditalpha Alternative Investment Advisors (Creditalpha). \n\nSetting the Context\n\nAs financial systems evolve, unscrupulous individuals find ingenious methods to launder their un-accounted wealth and re-route it into the financial system. One method of doing the same is setting up sham companies and routing unaccounted wealth to the company in the form of incoming investments which far exceed the actual value of the company. The investments, therefore, succeeded in taking un-accounted wealth and converting them into legitimate property by characterizing them as ‘share premiums’. \n\nIn order to clamp down on such practices, Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced vide the Finance Act 2012 which sought to tax such share premiums. This section is attracted in instances where unlisted companies received investments which exceed the ‘fair market value’ (FMV) of the shares. In such circumstances, the premium received over and above the FMV is brought to tax under the head ‘income from other sources’. This section is applicable only in cases where the genuineness of the transaction is not under question. If the investments in question are not genuine, Section 68 of the IT Act provides for treating the entire investment (including the share premium value) as being income of the recipient. Section 68, however, is beyond the scope of this article.  \n\nA perusal of Section 56(2)(viib) shows that the tax liability of the assessee is largely dependent on computing the FMV of the assessee on the date of investment. Rule 11UA(2) of the Income tax Rules 1962 (IT Rules) prescribes two methods of computing the FMV- the net asset value method (NAV) and the discounted cash flow method (DCF). While the former method largely relies on the value of assets while computing FMV, the latter method of valuation focuses on projections of revenue in the coming years based on pre-determined assumptions. While valuation based on NAV can be computed by the assessee itself, DCF valuation has to be done by a merchant banker only. Before looking into the controversy regarding whether the assessing officer (AO) can mandate the usage of any one particular method of valuation, it is useful to look into the merits and demerits of both methods. \n\nDCF v/s NAV \n\nThe DCF method is essentially a projection of what the company’s business would look like in the subsequent years based on certain assumptions made in the present. As a result, there is scope for variation between the projections and the actual performance of the company. Even if we were to disregard black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the difficulty in making accurate assumptions and considering all relevant factors makes the DCF method inherently prone to variance. In particular, the DCF method runs into difficulties when the inherent nature of the company’s business model does not involve consistent and periodic cash-flow. The NAV method, on the other hand, focuses on valuing the company at a particular point of time. It is much more static in nature, and relies on what the company is rather than what it might be. Therefore, in terms of certainty, the NAV method has an advantage over the DCF method. \n\nThat being said, the downside of the NAV method is that it envisions a more traditional business model which is largely dependent on the value of its assets. Newer business which are involved in the provision of services (particularly online) rely far lesser on traditional assets than a manufacturing company might. Besides, investors often base their decision to invest on the prospects of the company rather than its immediate value. In such circumstances therefore, a DCF method would be more appropriate to value the company.\n\nThis brings us to the earlier question of which model is the more appropriate valuation method. Going by the merits and de-merits of each method, it is clear that this question does not have a clear cut answer. The right method of valuation would ultimately depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case. This is why Rule 11UA(2) gives the assessee the option to choose either of the methods of valuation while computing FMV. When the IT Act itself provides a choice between two methods of valuation, can the AO reject a method of valuation adopted by the assessee and replace the same with another method? This was the question before the Mumbai ITAT which recently gave its ruling in the Creditalpha case.\n\nDCIT v/s Creditalpha Alternative Investment Advisors Limited\n\nThe factual matrix involved in this case is as follows. The assessee is a private company involved in providing financial and investment advice. It received investments at a premium valuation in the year 2013. The valuation was determine by using the DCF method. In reality, however, the projections turned out to be wrong and the company fell short of its revenue targets. The AO noted that had the assessee used the NAV method of valuation, the fair market value of the shares would be substantially lower (the value would in fact be negative). Therefore, the AO was of the opinion that by using the DCF method, the assessee has artificially increased the FMV of the shares, which has consequently decreased their tax liability. Accordingly, the AO made additions by computing FMV according to the NAV method.\n\nThe approach of the AO finds support in the Delhi ITAT ruling in the case of Agro Portfolio v. Income Tax Officer. The AO in this case noted that the rate of return which was assumed by the assessee while preparing the DCF model was abnormally high for its line of business. As a result, the AO formed an opinion that the valuation was incorrect, and proceeded to make additions by adopting a NAV method of valuation instead. The same was upheld by the ITAT which concluded that the assessee was unable to justify their DCF valuation.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of  TUV Rheinland NIFE Academy v. ITO, the AO noted that there was significant variance between revenue projections made in the DCF model and the actual revenue generated by the assessee. Accordingly, the AO deemed the valuation to be defective and proceeded to make additions on the basis of an NAV method. While upholding the additions, the Bangalore ITAT noted that the merchant banker/chartered accountant relies solely on the figures provided by the assessee while computing the DCF value. In case the DCF valuation is defective, the AO can substitute the same with an NAV based valuation and make suitable additions.\n\nThe Mumbai tribunal in Creditalpha, however, did not consider these rulings. Rather, the tribunal largely followed the ratio of the Bombay High Court in the case of Vodafone M Pesa Limited v. PCIT. The High Court in this case held that while the AO has the authority to scrutinize the valuation report, he cannot change the method of valuation which is opted by the assessee. Therefore, if the assessee has adopted a DCF valuation method, any subsequent re-evaluation by the AO must be done under the DCF method itself. Relying on this ratio, the ITAT held that the correctness of the DCF valuation cannot be determined in hindsight based on the actual performance of the company. The correctness of the valuation method can be determined only on the date of the report being prepared. Furthermore, the AO cannot challenge the veracity of the valuation report merely on the ground that the valuation is prepared by the merchant banker based on the data provided by the assessee. This approach has been seen in several other ITAT rulings as well (See this and this for instance).\nConcluding Remarks\n\nRulings such as that in Creditalpha come as a relief for assessees, who can exercise their choice of picking the most appropriate valuation method while seeking investments. That being said, the concerns raised by the department in these cases do have merit. There is no disputing the fact that DCF valuations are a form of projection which are largely dependent on the information provided by the assessee itself. Consistent patterns of high variance between the DCF valuations and the actual revenue generated should lead to re-evaluation of the manner in which the DCF valuations are being computed. \n\nThat being said, improving the efficacy of the DCF formula is more in the realm of economics/statistics. Until the formula is re-worked in a manner to better project revenue growth, the department must stick to the letter of the law and allow assessees to exercise their choice under the IT Act. It remains to be seen whether the issue reaches the apex court in light of the many conflicting rulings across tribunals. \nTaxValuationEquityCash FlowNAV\nTaxation Law\n1,462 views\n3 likes.

        "title": "Scale-Based Regulatory Frame(works)? Analysis of RBI’s Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs",
        "content": "Mehak Jain, Arush Mittal\nFeb 28, 2022\n7 min read\nScale-Based Regulatory Frame(works)? Analysis of RBI’s Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs\n[Mehak and Arush are students at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur.]\n\nNon-banking financial corporations (NBFCs), also referred to as ‘shadow banks’, have historically played a major role in the financial community by channelizing investments and savings for the retail, small-scaled, unorganised sector and unbanked territory of the economy. There has been tremendous growth in this sector over the years in relation to its operations, size and technological evolution. Currently, there is a total of 9,651 NBFCs across India. As on 31 March 2021, the asset size of the NBFC sector crossed INR 54 lakh crore which made it equivalent to one-fourth of the banking sector.\n\nThe crisis of IF&LS and the crisis of DHFL had almost engulfed the entire NBFC sector and also dented the long-drawn trust. While the NBFC community was still recovering from the set-back of this bleak downfall, nation-wide lockdown aggravated the situation in 2020 which put a halt to economic activities and further impacted NBFCs. Due to these factors, it was necessary to restore the trust in this sector by bringing-in a stringent regulation. It is in this background that RBI released the Discussion Paper on Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs (Discussion Paper) on 22 January 2021 and the Scale-Based Regulation: A revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs (Notification) on 22 October 2021 (applicable from 22 October 2022) with the motive of “calibrating the degree of regulatory prescriptions based on systemic importance of NBFCs”. Through this article, the authors aim to analyse the four main changes under the Scale-Based Regulations (SBR) (point 3.1 of the Notification) that would be applicable to all the NBFCs.\n\nUnderstanding the Scale-Based Regulation Model\n\nAccording to the new regulatory framework, NBFCs shall now be classified into four layers based on their size and complexity:\n\nNBFC-BL (Base Layer) – All non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of less than Rs. 1000 crore and particular NBFCs based on their activities such as NBFC-P2P, NBFCs not having access to public funds, and others specified in point 1.2 of the Notification fall in this layer.\n\nNBFC-ML (Middle Layer) – All deposit-taking NBFCs irrespective of their asset size, non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size more than Rs. 1000 Crores, and particular NBFCs based on their activities such as infrastructure debt funds, housing finance companies, and others specified in point 1.3 fall in this layer. \n\nNBFC-UL (Upper Layer) – Top 10 NBFCs in terms of their asset size and NBFCs specifically identified by the RBI on parameters listed in the Appendix to the Notification shall fall in this layer.\n\nNBFC-TL (Top Layer) – This layer shall remain empty, unless RBI is of the opinion that an NBFC ought to be moved to this layer by virtue of its perceived riskiness.\n\nThe objective behind such a classification is to postulate different compliance requirements based on the riskiness of NBFCs; those in the Base Layer are subject to less regulatory intervention than those in the Middle Layer, and so on. The classification is based on the principle of proportionality and ensures more focus on those entities which are more likely to fail and thus need proper regulation to avoid impact on systemic stability. \n\nRegulatory Changes under SBR and Comments\n\nIn addition to formulating a new model of classification, RBI has also made regulatory changes applicable to all layers, detailed in point 3.1 of the Notification. These changes and their impact are as follows:\n\nIPO financing capped at INR 1 crore per borrower\n\nWith an intention of curbing risks in the financial sector, RBI has introduced a limit of INR 1 crore per borrower for IPO financing subject to more conservative limits that may be opted for by NBFCs.\n\nIPO financing refers to the practice of borrowing funds for the sole purpose of applying for an IPO and is widely opted for by High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs). In IPO financing, lenders (usually banks and NBFCs) provide loans at a particular interest rate for applying for IPOs. The nature of transaction is such that it forces the investor to sell the shares as soon as they are listed. If this results in profit, the proceeds are used to repay the lender and the remainder amount is retained by the investor. If this results in loss, the investor is personally liable for repayment with interest.\n\nEvidently, this practice jeopardizes the interests of genuine long-term investors and hinders fair price discovery. It creates a distorted image of demand for interested retail investors and makes the market prone to volatility. As per the Discussion Paper, such a ceiling is necessary to prevent abuse of the system. \n\nIt is relevant to note that while there is a cap of INR 10 lakh on IPO financing by banks, no such limit existed for NBFCs prior to this Notification. The IPO Financing ceiling is applicable to all layers of NBFCs as opposed to the proposed applicability to NBFC’s in the middle layer and top layer, thereby cementing RBI’s intent of prevention of abuse of funds. \n\nInterestingly, the cap of INR 1 crore is per ‘borrower’ and not per ‘individual’, in contrast to what had been suggested by the Discussion Paper. This differentiates the Regulations from those applicable to banks, as banks are only permitted to lend to individuals for the purposes of IPO financing. Use of the term ‘borrower’ implies that corporates shall also be permitted to borrow funds for the purposes of IPO financing.\n\nNPA classification norms changed from 180 days to 90 days\n\nPrior to the Regulations, a loan account was classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) if the interest or principal remained unpaid for 180 days. This NPA classification norm has been now changed to 90 days instead. \n\nIn order to assess the impact of this move, it may be argued that owing to the difference in the type of NBFC-clientele with regards to the difference in cash flow and frequency, such a change was unnecessary. However, RBI in its Discussion Paper clarified that such unique cash flow aspects of business can be factored in by NBFCs while arriving at the due date. Thus, the end impact of the proposed 90-day NPA classification is unlikely to interfere with the business of NBFCs.\n\nNOF limit increased from INR 2 crore to INR 10 crore\n\nAn NBFC cannot commence its business unless it has a minimum stipulated requirement of Net-Owned Funds (NOF). Prior to this Notification, the minimum NOF requirement was INR 2 crore. \n\nNOF has been defined under the Explanation to Section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act,1934 and also under question 18 of the FAQs on the official website as an: \n\n“aggregate of the paid-up equity capital and free reserves as disclosed in the latest balance-sheet of the company after deduction therefrom- accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue expenditure and other intangible assets; which is further reduced by the amounts representing investments of such companies in shares of its subsidiaries, companies in the same group and all other NBFCs and the book value of debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances”.\n\nRBI has made changes to the regulatory minimum stipulated NOF for NBFC-ICC (investment and credit company), NBFC-MFI (micro finance institution) and NBFC-factors. As per this change, the minimum NOF requirement for these three types of NBFCs shall be increased to INR 10 crore in contrast to the earlier limit of INR 2 crore, INR 5 crore and INR 5 crore respectively. Such a change shall be implemented in a phased manner and the INR 10 crore limit shall be applicable from 31 March 2027. \n\nNBFCs with no public funds and no customer interface as well as NBFC-P2P (peer to peer lending platform) and NBFC-AA (account aggregators) shall continue to have the regulatory minimum NOF limit of INR 2 crore as before. Further, regarding the NBFCs with a higher regulatory minimum NOF (ranges from INR 20 crore to INR 300 crore), RBI has made no change in their NOF requirements.\n\nIn the Discussion Paper, RBI briefly discussed the rationale behind increasing the minimum stipulated NOF even further for the three types of NBFCs (as discussed above). The requirement of INR 2 crore contained a high possibility of failure for the non-serious players. For an NBFC to carry out its business in an appropriate manner, it must be adequately capitalised, financially resilient, and well-regulated. To inculcate such features for all the NBFCs, RBI intended to increase the entry norm for the other NBFCs to INR 20 crore (from the current INR 2 crore) as mentioned in the Discussion Paper; basing its contention on the increase in “real GDP” and “regulatory judgement”. \n\nHowever, NBFCs and other market participants, in their feedback, mentioned that they were against such a high requirement. Therefore, the minimum requirement was cut-short by half and a comfortable transition period was provided to the requisite NBFCs. Nevertheless, this definitely comes in as a positive change to raise the entry barrier for NBFCs and makes sure that the business is carried on by serious participants only.\n\nChanges to board member requirements\n\nRBI has made it compulsory for one of the directors of the board to be a person with relevant experience of having worked in either a bank or an NBFC for all NBFCs.\n\nThe rationale behind this change is to implement the concept of corporate governance for all the NBFCs and in turn, keep an adequate mix of experience and educational qualification on the Board. This can be ascertained from point 4.2.3 (c) of Chapter 4 of the Discussion Paper where RBI proposed that one of the directors shall have retail lending experience in a bank/NBFC. \n\nRBI’s intent of instilling corporate governance standards in all NBFCs is evident from its discussion of corporate governance guidelines for all four layers of NBFCs in point 3.2.3 of Section II of the Notification as well as from multiple points of the Discussion Paper such as point 4.3.3.5 dealing with corporate governance norms for NBFC-ML and point 4.4.2.3 dealing with corporate governance norms for NBFC-UL. \n\nThis additionally shows RBI’s intent to further the motive of the NBFC - Corporate Governance (Reserve Bank) Directions 2015. In the authors’ opinion, inclusion of a board member with prior experience can be seen as a small-step to gain corporate governance standards across all NBFCs.\n\nConclusion \n\nOperational flexibility of NBFCs, in comparison to the banking sector, has enabled them to achieve a pivotal position in the financial ecosystem. It puts them at a position where their failure could impact systemic stability and create a domino effect resulting in the collapse of not just the NBFC community but also the entire financial sector. The NBFC sector needs to keep pace with the changing realities and the revised scale-based regulatory framework is a step forward in this regard. The Notification is indispensable in not only restoring the lost trust in the sector, but also rebuilding the confidence of investors and lenders over the longer-term.\n\nDue to this reason, the revised scale-based regulatory framework is indispensable. It not only restores the lost trust in the sector, but also rebuilds the confidence of investors and lenders over the longer-term.\nRBINBFCScale-BasedNPA\nCorporate Law\n890 views\n10 likes.

        "title": "Secured Creditors and Registration of Interests: A Change in Rights",
        "content": "Sudiksha Ravi\nFeb 25, 2022\n4 min read\nSecured Creditors and Registration of Interests: A Change in Rights\n[Sudiksha is a student at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata.]\n\nThe Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interests Act 2002 (SARFAESI Act) was enacted with the aim of, among others, regulating the malpractices that could accompany the creation of secured interests. To that effect, the SARFAESI Act created the Central Registry (CERSAI) to oversee these matters, and provided that the particulars of all such security transactions be filed with this body. \n\nThe Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Act 2016 (Amending Act) was then passed in order to modify the rights of a secured creditor under the SARFAESI Act, particularly in relation to the filing of security interests with the CERSAI. Sections 17, 18, and 19 of the Amending Act were made enforceable starting 24 January 2020, vide the Ministry of Finance Notification S.O.4619(E) dated 26 December 2019. This article briefly assesses the rights of secured creditors conditional to such filing - prior to, and after the amendment. \n\nPrior to the Amendment\n\nSection 23 of the SARFAESI Act stated that the particulars of every transaction of securitization, asset reconstruction or creation of security interest were to be filed with CERSAI within 30 days of the event. Section 27 provided a monetary penalty for any secured creditor who did not file their interests. \n\nNon-compliance with Section 23 however, did not take away any rights of the creditor under the act. The security interest created retained its validity and the secured creditor was allowed to proceed under the SARFAESI Act for any enforcement of rights, regardless of registration with the CERSAI. Various judgements of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) have supported this inference. In Geetha Elizabeth Mathew v. Kerala State Co-operative Bank [SA Number 193 of 2013, DRT-Ernakulam], the DRT remarked that non-registration/non-filing of transactions whereby mortgages are created does not by itself render the mortgage void and unenforceable. In Sunita Traders v. Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited, the tribunal observed that even in cases of non-filing with the CERSAI, a secured creditor could continue to enforce their security interest. \n\nPost Amendment: New Rules, New Confusions\n\nThe amendment provisions made operational in 2020 brought some important changes to the securities framework. The time limit as per Section 23 for registering a security interest was removed, and Section 27, which was a penal provision was deemed omitted from the day of enforcement of the amendment. \n\nSection 26-D of the newly inserted Chapter IV-A was brought in as a replacement to the now removed penalty for non-registration. It states that no secured creditor can enforce their rights under Chapter III of the SARFAESI Act unless the interest created in their favour has been registered with the CERSAI. It is evident that a higher degree of importance has been placed on the filing of security interests, the ignorance of which will disentitle the secured creditor from seeking any remedy under this act. Further, this section applies to only secured creditors and no one else. Non-registration would thus effectively put them at a position lower than any other creditors if such matter were taken to court. These add up to a penalty more severe than the previously applied monetary fine – a new form of reinforcement to ensure compliance with the filing provisions. \n\nDespite seemingly clear phrasing, some confusions creep in with the amendment. A pertinent aspect to be examined is whether any part of this section is designed to operate in a retrospective manner – something the section does not explicitly state. First, it must be examined whether proceedings initiated prior to the amendment, on the basis of an unregistered security, would have to be dismissed. The 2021 judgement of Bank of Baroda v. Umang Gyanchandani was concerned with an appeal against an order passed prior to the amendment. The Appellate DRT did not consider the impact of Section 26-D on the case at all, stating that there is no impediment for the defendant Bank to proceed under the SARFAESI Act if the security interest has not been registered. Thus, one can conclude that Section 26-D would not vitiate proceedings that were in progress before its effective date. Though not expressly stated, this inference seems logical and fair as compared to one which would vitiate proceedings that are underway. \n\nSecond, there is a lack of clarity regarding whether only those security interests created after the enforcement of the section need to be registered to ensure a secured creditor maintains their rights. If it applies to interests made or modified before 24th January, 2020, it would become retrospective in a sense. It is submitted that the plain words of Section 26-D do not appear to concern themselves with the creation of the interest, but only the enforcement of the rights surrounding the same. It could thus be interpreted to state that from the effective date, no unregistered interest can be the basis for a secured creditor’s claim under the SARFAESI Act, regardless of when the interest came into existence. This proposition seems to find support in the case of Shanmugadurai v. Authorised Officer, ASREC. The DRT examined compliance with Section 26-D for a security interest created in 2013, and ruled that the requirements of registration were fulfilled. \n\nAnother important question becomes whether this section entitles an individual to claim that a security interest is void on account of not being registered. The case of Abdul Latheef v. Nilambur Bank was decided in 2019, prior to the amendment. The DRT disallowed Abdul Latheef from arguing that the mortgage against him was void and unenforceable on account of non-registration of the same with the CERSAI, as Section 26-D had not yet come into effect. Drawing from this, it could appear that once Section 26-D came into effect, a non-registered security could be considered void. However, there is no mention of the same in the legislation or in case laws, and thus, no certainty on this subject.  \n\nConclusion\n\nThe rights of the secured creditors have been varied with the amendment, which has also been accompanied by confusions of its own. Going forward, it is essential for the DRT and for the legislators to make specifications to address such confusions. Where the secured creditor is losing their right to proceed under the SARFAESI Act upon non-registration, it is also vital for them to know if the security interest is void due to such non-registration. The filing of interests with the CERSAI, when mandatory, would ensure regular compliance, provide foresight into possible legal arguments, and help better achieve the objectives of the SARFAESI Act and the amendment. \nIBCFinancial CreditorsInsolvencyDebtSARFAESI Act\nInsolvency Law\n1,444 views\n3 likes.

        "content": "Rida Ameen\nFeb 19, 2022\n6 min read\nRetrospective Application of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act 2015: A Step Back?\n[Rida is a student at School of Law, Christ (Deemed to be University).]\n\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act 2015 (2015 Amendment) introduced several landmark changes to the arbitration framework in India, making arbitrations time-bound and cost-effective. However, the advantages of the 2015 Amendment were diluted owing to the confusion surrounding the application of the amendment. Although the debate was later settled in BCCI v. Kochi Cricket (BCCI), the judgment of the Supreme Court (SC) in Ellora Paper Mills v. State of Madhya Pradesh (Ellora Paper Mills) passed in January 2022, has reignited the debate regarding the retrospective application of the 2015 Amendment. \n\nAlthough the court did not specifically discuss the applicability of the 2015 Amendment, it applied Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act) to an arbitration that was pending when the amendment came into force. This runs contrary to Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment. This may be used as precedent to challenge the appointment of arbitrators in pending arbitrations which commenced before the 2015 Amendment was enforced. If pursued, it will lead to prolonged litigation between parties. This article seeks to analyse the ambit of Section 26 and the implications of the judgment of Ellora Paper Mills in this regard. \n\nStatutory Provisions\n\nSection 12(5) of the Act provides that a person cannot act as an arbitrator if such person’s relationship with the parties, counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls within the ambit of Schedule Seven of the Act. The Fifth and Seventh Schedules spell out the circumstances under which the neutrality of an arbitrator may be affected. \n\nSince Section 12(5) was introduced through the 2015 Amendment, its application is subject to Section 26 which provides that the Act shall not apply to arbitral proceedings which commenced before the 2015 Amendment came into force, i.e., 23 October 2015, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. The Act does, however, apply to all other proceedings ‘in relation to arbitral proceedings’. Commencement under Section 26 must be interpreted as per Section 21 which provides that arbitral proceedings commence when the respondent receives a request for the dispute to be referred to arbitration.\n\nRetrospective Application under Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment\n\nThe interpretation of Section 26, in the context of the application of the 2015 Amendment to pending court proceedings varied across High Courts. Finally, in BCCI, the SC clarified that the 2015 Amendment applied prospectively to court proceedings as well as arbitral proceedings which began after the amendment came into force. Although Section 12(5) was not a point of discussion in BCCI, it was made explicitly clear that the 2015 Amendment would not apply to any arbitral proceedings which commenced prior to 23 October 2015. \n\nPosition Prior to Ellora Paper Mills \n\nAs per the 246th Report of the Law Commission, Section 12(5) and the Seventh Schedule were introduced to ensure the independence and impartiality of arbitrators, which is the hallmark of any arbitration. If an arbitrator falls within any of the categories under Schedule Seven, it will strike at the very jurisdiction of the arbitrator to continue with the proceedings. \n\nAlthough it may seem that the provision must be applied to pending arbitrations, , the decision of the court in BCCI has been diligently followed in cases pertaining to Section 12(5). In Aravali Power Company Private Limited v. Era Infra Engineering Limited and Rajasthan Small Industries Corporation Limited v. Ganesh Containers and Movers Syndicate, the issue of application of Section 12(5) arose. In both cases, arbitral proceedings began much before the 2015 Amendment was enforced. Moreover, the party objecting to the constitution of the tribunal had already participated in the arbitral proceedings. In these circumstances, apart from holding that the 2015 Amendment cannot operate retrospectively, the SC also observed that the parties invoking Section 12(5) had already acquiesced to the appointment of the arbitrator and had raised an objection much later in the proceedings.\n\nHowever, in S.P. Singla Constructions v. State of Himachal Pradesh, the respondent continuously avoided the arbitration proceedings by either remaining absent or requesting an adjournment stating that they would challenge the appointment of the arbitrator. Although no proceedings were held before the arbitrator, the SC held that the appointment of the arbitrator is valid as the 2015 Amendment cannot apply to proceedings which began in 2013. This clarified that even if objections were raised at an early stage, the 2015 Amendment could not apply. While the facts are similar to that of the S. P. Singla decision, the decision rendered in Ellora Paper Mills is starkly contrasting. \n\nThe Decision in Ellora Paper Mills\n\nAfter a dispute arose between the parties, the appellant filed a suit before the civil court seeking recovery of money in 1998. However, due to the arbitration clause, a Section 8 application was filed by the respondents which was subsequently rejected. On appeal, the High Court referred the parties to arbitration, and an arbitral tribunal was constituted in the year 2000, consisting of five officers of the respondents. The appellants challenged the jurisdiction of the tribunal by filing a writ petition before the High Court, which was dismissed in 2017. Ultimately, in 2019, they filed an application under Section 14 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, contending that the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdiction based on Section 12(5). The High Court held that the 2015 Amendment cannot operate retrospectively to pending arbitrations.\n\nOn appeal, the SC categorically observed that no further steps were taken after the constitution of the tribunal in 2001 and therefore, the proceedings did not technically commence. Hence, the court applied Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule. Relying on the decisions given in TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Products (TRF) and Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited v. M/s Ajay Sales and Suppliers (Jaipur Zila), the court held that once the arbitrator falls within any one of the categories under Schedule Seven, he will de-jure be unable to perform his functions. In other words, his mandate terminates and he cannot act as an arbitrator. In the instant case, all five arbitrators were related to the respondent as they were officers of the respondent, thereby terminating their mandate as per Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule. Thus, a new independent arbitrator was appointed by the court.\n\nAnalysis of the Decision\n\nIt is clear in this case that the court ruled equitably in favour of the appellants since the arbitration proceedings have been pending since 2000. Although the decision upholds the principles of impartiality and neutrality of an arbitrator and ensures that the dispute is resolved in a fair manner, the judgment is incorrect regarding the concept of commencement of the arbitration proceedings under Section 21 and, more importantly, the application of the 2015 Amendment.\n\nThe court’s application of Section 12(5) was based on the rationale that the proceedings had not ‘technically’ commenced since no proceedings or hearings were held before the tribunal. However, the commencement of an arbitral proceeding for these purposes must be determined as per Section 21, which provides that the date of commencement will be the date on which the opposite party received the notice of arbitration or when the court referred the parties to arbitration. It is not mandatory that hearings must be held before the arbitrator since there is a difference between the expression commencement of an arbitration proceeding used in Section 21 and commencement of proceedings before an arbitrator. As observed in Milkfood Limited v. GMC Ice Cream Private Limited, the former means the formal commencement of proceedings after notice of arbitration is received by the opposite party or an order referring the parties to arbitration is passed, whereas the latter means the date on which the first hearing is held before an arbitrator. Under Section 26, formal commencement of proceedings is considered while applying the 2015 Amendment. The court failed to take this into account in Ellora Paper Mills since the proceedings had commenced in the year 2000 when an order referring the parties to arbitration was passed. The court also incorrectly relied on the decisions given in TRF and Jaipur Zila because in those cases, arbitration proceedings had commenced after the 2015 Amendment came into force and thus, Section 12(5) could be invoked. \n\nHence, although not explicitly stated, the decision has the effect of applying the 2015 Amendment retrospectively to proceedings that commenced before it came into effect. \n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the holding in Ellora Paper Mills is contrary to Section 26, courts are inclined to apply the 2015 Amendment to cases involving questions of biased arbitrators to ensure that the proceedings are fair and just. This may be in favour of the parties in the case, but it also sets a precedent allowing other parties to object to the appointment of arbitrators before whom proceedings have been continuing for an extended period of time. The parties are subject to a law they never knew existed at the time of the arbitrator's appointment. Hence, courts must deter from this practice to avoid inconvenience to the parties involved.\nArbitrationAmendmentSection 26\nDispute Resolution\n1,305 views\n5 likes. Post not marked as liked\n5"
